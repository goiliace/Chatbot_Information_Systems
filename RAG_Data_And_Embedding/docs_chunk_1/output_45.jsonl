"for accessing pre-made analytical objects has been deprecated (marking the end of official support and development). Thus, this affordance is not actualized.The enabling condition is that data is collected and available through the platform and the feature space provided by the platform. A stimulating condition, based on previous research on technology acceptance, indicates that the conjunction of well-informed technology design, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use will increase the intention to use mobile health applications (Mohamed et al.,2011). Mobile device management is required to efficiently administrate a large number of phones or tablets. Privacy and data protection measures must be in place, especially in regard to personally identifiable information of patients. In order to use a mobile application effectively, a certain data literacy is required. The outcome in theory would be increased data availability in the field: larger devices, such as personal computers, do not need to be carried around anymore. One interviewee (INT3) stated: \"... we cannot expect them to bring the laptop. I think that would be way easier with a tablet [...] That's why the paper works better, because they put the paper in the pocket, because they would use it anytime. So I think anything that tries to be similar to paper in that sense, or to a notebook, would work.\" Mobile devices can be more easily brought to meetings or training sessions with internal staff but also external"
"pocket, because they would use it anytime. So I think anything that tries to be similar to paper in that sense, or to a notebook, would work.\" Mobile devices can be more easily brought to meetings or training sessions with internal staff but also external stakeholders, for example during meetings with staff of the country's Ministry of Health, \"to make it a bit more interesting for everyone to know, to give an idea what we are doing\" (statement of INT4). This advocacy is enabled as soon as a certain level of interactivity with data and the counterpart is required. It can be expected that one of the outcomes is an increased need for individual user support and training as more devices are in use that need to transmit data. It also requires substantial institutional investments in hardware and software.This mechanism is informed by two not-actualized affordances due to unrecorded contextual conditions (Bygstad et al.,2016). The feature space and organizational strategy allow a mobile and collaborative analysis, which in turn enhances the social discourse for evidence-based decision-making. However, both require a minimal level of connectivity to the Internet to be minimally operational. Another structural aspect is the sustainability when collaborating with local institutions, as one participant noted (INT4): \"with the [advantages of the] digital, the sustainability is a problem, because once we leave they [the Ministry of Health] will not maintain all this, and with all the"
"when collaborating with local institutions, as one participant noted (INT4): \"with the [advantages of the] digital, the sustainability is a problem, because once we leave they [the Ministry of Health] will not maintain all this, and with all the updates of the software I don't think it will work when we leave... they are back to paper.\" Thus, this mechanism promises to increase internal collaboration but is limited in its discourse with local \"external\" institutions and is depicted in Figure 13.4.4 Mechanism interactionsSince three identified mechanisms emerge within the same context, the same platform but multiple teams, it is possible to reason on how these mechanisms might interact based on the conditions and outcomes. A listing of the mechanisms and related affordances is found in Table3.FIGURE 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointMobile analysis affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)TABLE  3.Mechanisms and related affordancesMechanismAffordancesActualizedTemplated analytics serviceTemplated analytical object provisionyesAdaptation of provisioned analytic toolsyesStandardizationRationalizationyesSynchronizationyesCollaborative and mobile capabilitiesCollaborative analysisnoMobile data analysisnoThe interaction of the mechanisms is visualized in Figure14.

"mechanisms is visualized in Figure14. The standardization mechanism (the quantified use, lean content, generification and synchronized distribution) positively influences the analytics service mechanism (more specifically, the enabling conditions of its affordances: shared accountability, responsibility and feature space). The analytics service in turn enables the collaboration on the provided dashboard and dashboard items as well as the usage of the same dashboards on a (not available) new or integrated mobile application.FIGURE 13Open in figure viewerPowerPointCollaborative and mobile capabilities mechanism (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)FIGURE 14Open in figure viewerPowerPointMechanisms interactionThe additional internal social discourse on data can again be input to the mechanism of standardization (institutional capabilities and processes). However, the influence of the collaborative and mobile capabilities mechanisms was not further studied due the limited empirical evidence of nonactualized affordances.5 DISCUSSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSThe application of critical realism and affordance-based data analysis has helped to explore a limited set of issues in humanitarian health management information systems. This study pointed to three mechanisms in operation that influenced digitalization efforts and the use of information in project monitoring.

A summary of the definitions of the identified mechanisms are given in Table4.TABLE  4.HHMIS mechanismsMechanismDefinitionTemplated analytics serviceThe processes of providing templated analytical objects by intermediary digital health experts to frontline staff leading to relationships of users, producers and providers of data and related analysis tools.StandardizationDynamic requirements and legacy migrations inform a rationalization and distribution of IS content leading to a standardization strategy of flexible generification.Collaborative and mobile capabilitiesThe process of strategizing the feature space for mobile and collaborative data analysis for increase in internal social discourse and advocacy.The mechanisms identified in this study provide arguments for strategic developments and further research.First, further research in the provision-use relationship of the analytics service is needed, as making \"the system easy to use\" is one factor in achieving greater acceptance (Mohamed et al.,2011). Additionally, it might prove beneficial if a solution can help to effectively balance the competing demands between time constraints of front-line staff and required maintenance of analytical items in order to improve the efficiency for decision-making.

"can help to effectively balance the competing demands between time constraints of front-line staff and required maintenance of analytical items in order to improve the efficiency for decision-making. One path for further research is predictive analytics which--in theory--reduces the time necessary for human input in decision-making (Kasthurirathne et al.,2020).Second, continuing the strategy of flexible generification is recommended as it is the most innovative standardization strategy (Hanseth & Bygstad,2015). Furthermore, the synchronization affordance is one step closer to ICT-enabled real-time data (RTD) systems. RTD systems facilitate tactical adaptive management (iterative corrective action in program implementation), which acknowledges that changes are inevitable and programs might need to be altered in response to unexpected forces, especially in humanitarian work (Barnett et al.,2019). RTD systems, however, are currently limited in their ability to inform most strategic adaptive management as neither the timely provision of data nor accuracy of data determines adaptive success (Barnett et al.,2019). Thus, further research into the enablers and barriers of information use within RTD systems is necessary.Finally, the development and use of platform-based collaboration tools in combination with mobile analysis technology more closely suited to the needs of front-line teams is a promising area for further research and development.6 CONCLUSIONThis study explored the"
"the development and use of platform-based collaboration tools in combination with mobile analysis technology more closely suited to the needs of front-line teams is a promising area for further research and development.6 CONCLUSIONThis study explored the generative mechanisms in a globally operating humanitarian medical organization. It focused on the outcomes, conditions and structures of information use for project monitoring, drawing on a critical realist approach. It posed the research question:which generative mechanisms contingently lead to effective use of information for project monitoring in international humanitarian medical organizations?It identified three mechanisms through an aggregation or abstraction of six affordances. Through that, the study provided an implementation of a critical realist case study in IS research, specifically an application of the analysis framework by Bygstad et al. (2016) to identify generative mechanisms. The purpose of the research was to provide explanation and not prediction. Nevertheless, it is able to provide arguments for more research on analytic service relationships, real-time data systems and collaborative and mobile data analysis in humanitarian health management information systems.Aid organizations act in highly dynamic, complex and unpredictable environments and need to deal with transitions from immediate needs to long-term development. All throughout they are expected to prove their accountability and effectiveness."
"systems.Aid organizations act in highly dynamic, complex and unpredictable environments and need to deal with transitions from immediate needs to long-term development. All throughout they are expected to prove their accountability and effectiveness. Here, data and information use cannot be isolated from the structures in which they occur. As irreversible life-or-death decisions are made based on increasingly digitized content, it is important to illuminate IS-related patterns and processes. The findings demonstrate that mechanism-based explanations can be useful in theory-building in IS research. The study attempted to build upon the existing but limited empirical evidence in humanitarian health information systems.In building IS theory through the philosophy of critical realism, empirical generalization is considered valuable and often the first step for future studies (Tsang,2014). The subsequent or parallel step of theoretical generalization is largely based on the process of retroduction: the logical argument explaining what conditions and structures must exist in order for the set of events to be enacted. In that way, the findings discussed in this study are not applicable to other settings (such as another organization) as the mechanisms (including their contingent conditions and structures) that cause the outcomes cannot be replicated. In place of prediction, the study provides insight into how and why a similar mechanism could lead to different (or similar) outcomes"
"as the mechanisms (including their contingent conditions and structures) that cause the outcomes cannot be replicated. In place of prediction, the study provides insight into how and why a similar mechanism could lead to different (or similar) outcomes in a different setting (Wynn & Williams,2012). Additionally, the approach utilized in this study of conducting interviews, document reviews and affordance-based qualitative data analysis can provide methodological guidance for practical implementations in other humanitarian organizations. Understanding the socio-technical patterns in their information system and wider context can inform strategic developments, for example through analysis and subsequent strengthening of identified conditions.6.1 Further researchThis case study has focused on organization within the humanitarian medical sector. Expanding the scope to further domains, and including multiple organizations in a multi-case study, can increase the validity of the findings. This expansion also might render identified mechanisms less relevant in light of causally more stringent mechanisms, as only the mechanisms that have the strongest explanatory power and empirical evidence are to be explored further (Bygstad et al.,2016; Wynn & Williams,2012).

"AbstractThe development and utilisation of new information and communication technologies presents opportunities and risks, which bring ethical issues to the forefront. Any attempt to minimise the potential negative consequences to individuals, organisations and society resulting from the use of these technologies is challenging. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an ethics-by-design approach that has been developed and implemented in the context of Decision Supports Systems for Emergency Management. Such systems help manage large and cross-border disasters by supporting decision makers to respond on emergencies in a reasonable way by taking follow-up actions into account. The approach taken in this paper specifically provides means to support the ethical dimensions of these decisions. Actions taken during disasters can have ramifications that persist long after a disaster has passed. The ethics-by-design approach presented here not only informs the design of systems, but also considers the role and training of the decision makers in the design process. The paper builds on the literature on ethics in information systems and makes a contribution to theory by providing a framework to ensure ethical considerations are embedded into the design of systems.1 INTRODUCTIONAlthough the design and application of novel technologies introduce opportunities, such activities bring ethical issues to the fore.

"are embedded into the design of systems.1 INTRODUCTIONAlthough the design and application of novel technologies introduce opportunities, such activities bring ethical issues to the fore. Consequently, some researchers have warned of the negative and unintended consequences of technology use (Tarafdar et al.,2015). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with the pervasive use of social media, underscore the need to consider the ethical implications of technology (cf. Jobin et al.,2019).Quantifying the potential cost to individuals, organisations and society, resulting from technology use, represents a significant challenge (Heder,2017; Stahl et al.,2016). Nonetheless, the exploration of ethical issues associated with technology is essential for the advancement of information systems (IS) research and practice (cf. Davison,2000; Davison et al.,2001; Mingers & Walsham,2010; Walsham,2012). Guidelines, (Rogerson et al.,2000) codes of conduct (Oz,1992), and principles (cf. Myers & Venable,2014; Walsham,1996) have been used to guide researchers to \"do no harm.\"Emerging technologies may place a huge burden on users regarding their ethical use. Even those who are fully aware of the importance of ethics can encounter challenges because of cognitive limitations in decision-making (Gigerenzer,2010). For example, the use of a new technology could lead to consequences that are not fully understood and foreseen by the user (cf. Tarafdar et al.,2015). As a result,"
"encounter challenges because of cognitive limitations in decision-making (Gigerenzer,2010). For example, the use of a new technology could lead to consequences that are not fully understood and foreseen by the user (cf. Tarafdar et al.,2015). As a result, there is a need to embed ethical aspects, and guidance for ethical use, inside the technology rather than placing sole responsibility on the users. This paper addresses the problem of how to integrate ethics in the design process of technology that inherently raise important ethical questions. The key aim of the paper is to create a framework that embeds ethics within the design of a new technology. In particular, it supports the creation of an ethics-by-design approach that addresses the context and lifecycle of a research and development project and includes the user in the design.System designers bear responsibility to ensure ethical purpose (respecting fundamental rights, principles and values) as well as technical robustness in the design, development and deployment of new systems (cf. Friedman et al.,2008). However, there remains few holistic guidelines for researchers who wish to incorporate ethical considerations into artefact design (cf. Chatterjee et al.,2009). This paper proposes, theory engrained, practical guidelines that can be used by IS designers and researchers to proactively minimise the negative consequences of IS design and use.Building on the literature in IS and computer ethics, the ethics-by-design"
"This paper proposes, theory engrained, practical guidelines that can be used by IS designers and researchers to proactively minimise the negative consequences of IS design and use.Building on the literature in IS and computer ethics, the ethics-by-design approach was developed and implemented in the context of a three-year funded security capability research project incorporating the development of a decision support system (DSS) for emergency management (EM). The goal of this system was to support decision-makers to make \"good\" decisions that consider the consequences of follow-up actions. The design of systems to help manage large and cross-border disasters present unique challenges. The allocation of life-saving resources, for example, may result in ethical dilemmas, which present decision makers with equally undesirable outcomes (Geale,2012). Actions taken during disasters can have ramifications that persist long after a disaster has passed. Concepts of ethics and behaviour in EM decision-making have societal implications which may advance scholarship and practice in analogous settings where the allocation of, and application of, life-saving resources may present ethical dilemmas which often include equally undesirable outcomes (Geale,2012). This paper builds on previous research which argues that ethical considerations should be incorporated into IS design (Friedman et al.,2008; Stahl et al.,2014).

"outcomes (Geale,2012). This paper builds on previous research which argues that ethical considerations should be incorporated into IS design (Friedman et al.,2008; Stahl et al.,2014). Furthermore, the authors propose that research focusing on the ethical obligations inherent in EM research may provide useful insights for IS researchers.This paper contributes to the literature both in addressing the call to embed ethics into system's design and providing a practical approach to evaluating the ethical dimensions of technology artefacts. Although this work looks specifically at DSS for EM, the design could be adopted by other types of IS that have societal impact, especially in connection with new technologies.This paper is organised as follows. Section2explores the discipline of EM and describes the challenges, and inherent difficulties, associated with multi-agency EM. Next, the use of technology for EM is discussed and the S-HELP system is introduced. Following this, ethical issues associated with technology design and usage are discussed. Section3presents a framework for integrating an ethics-by-design approach into a DSS for EM. The framework engages with the academic literature on computer ethics and ethical assessment. The framework provides guidance in the application of ethics-by-design in information systems development.

"The framework provides guidance in the application of ethics-by-design in information systems development. A practical example of this is presented in Section4through the design, development and evaluation on S-HELP. Finally, Section5discusses the contribution of our research on ethics research and computer ethics, as well as information systems development.2 BACKGROUND2.1 Emergency managementNatural and manmade disasters have the potential to cause widespread loss of life and long-lasting economic damage (Farazmand,2014). Cascading disasters can also result in amplification and subsidiary events, which can devastate critical infrastructure (Pescaroli & Alexander,2016). Due to the multifaceted nature of disaster types and durations, planning and responding to such events requires a multidisciplinary approach (Noran,2014). In addition to widespread loss of life, large-scale disasters can place a significant burden on decision-making (Zhou et al.,2018) and the global supply chain (Lauge et al.,2015). Collaboration and coordination represent significant challenges in EM (Carlson et al.,2017). Each agency often has its own control structure, objectives, standard operating procedures (SOPs), terminology and even organisational culture (Kapucu et al.,2010; Salmon et al.,2011). Yet despite these differences, agencies must often work together towards a common shared goal. A coordinated response often requires agencies, who have not collaborated before, to collaborate despite"
"culture (Kapucu et al.,2010; Salmon et al.,2011). Yet despite these differences, agencies must often work together towards a common shared goal. A coordinated response often requires agencies, who have not collaborated before, to collaborate despite fundamentally different remits (cf. Weick & Sutcliffe,2007). The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the need for a coordinated global response requiring expertise from a myriad of disciplines operating in unfamiliar territory (ECDC,2020; Pisano et al.,2020).EM refers to the coordinated activities, which seek to control and reduce the impact of disasters. The formalisation of the discipline first took shape in 1950s America due to the threat of nuclear war (Haddow et al.,2017). Since then, the discipline has moved from top-down hierarchical control structures towards more flexible collaborative models (Waugh Jr & Streib,2006). In such arrangements, interoperability and coordination are key. Coordination and control represent real challenges when multiple agencies, including civilian organisations, must collaborate in unfamiliar territory with new control structures (cf. Bharosa et al.,2010; Lanzara,1983; McMaster & Baber,2012; Quarantelli,1988; Salmon et al.,2011).2.2 Technology for EMEffective interorganizational and cross disciplinary communication are pertinent both to the domain of IS and EM (Beydoun et al.,2018).

"for EMEffective interorganizational and cross disciplinary communication are pertinent both to the domain of IS and EM (Beydoun et al.,2018). According to Chen et al., (2008, p. 202) an effective \"information supply chain\" is crucial to facilitate inter-organisational and intra-organisational cooperation that is the hallmark of EM. Indeed, sensitivity to the initial conditions of a disaster and relationships with other organisations, including community groups, can have more of an impact than leadership in EM (Koehler et al.,2014). Though information systems (IS) can play an important role in this regard, IS often play only a tangential role in the EM literature (Leidner et al.,2009). Nonetheless, the promise of technology-enhanced EM has been a feature of the EM literature since the 1970s (cf. Quarantelli,1978). Since then, many ICT tools have been used to support the human activities of EM (Hu & Kapucu,2016). Examples include two-way radios, global positioning systems (GPS) enabled devices, internet of things (IoT) devices and sensors (Ray et al.,2017) and satellite phones. Dedicated standalone information systems for EM have also emerged. Sahana EDEN, for example, is a server-based disaster management information system (DMIS) that was introduced in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (Rafi et al.,2018). Perhaps accounting for the unique signature of each disaster type, numerous discrete information systems to support EM have also emerged. These include: DSS"
"(DMIS) that was introduced in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (Rafi et al.,2018). Perhaps accounting for the unique signature of each disaster type, numerous discrete information systems to support EM have also emerged. These include: DSS (Van de Walle & Turoff,2008; Wallace & de Balogh,1985), knowledge management systems (KMS) for EM (Dorasamy et al.,2013), EM information systems (EMIS) (Carver & Turoff,2007), geographic information systems (GIS) (Cova,1999), hazard analysis and modelling systems (Zerger & Wealands,2004) and resource management systems (cf. Özdamar & Ertem,2015; Sangiamkul & Van Hillegersberg,2011). Social media and crowdsourcing tools have also been used successfully in EM (McCormick,2016; Reuter et al.,2012; Tim et al.,2017) though their use is not without drawbacks (cf. Alexander,2014). The IS literature often views EM through the lens of information sharing and interoperability (Allen et al.,2014) both in terms of information quality and the architectures and tools which facilitate it (Bharosa et al.,2009). However, there remains a gap regarding how ethics can be embedded in IS to support interoperability and multi-agency collaboration.

"project, which incorporated an ethics-by-design approach.2.3 The S-HELP approachS-HELP is a DSS designed to be used by strategic decision-makers during large-scale disasters. The DSS provides access to features and functionality via modules. It was designed and developed using open-source tools and frameworks. A key feature of the DSS is a situation management console (Figure1), which provides users with the ability to create, modify, and delete situations (disaster events). The underlying database management system (DBMS) stores data about the incident type (e.g., flood, epidemic, explosion), location and severity. Depending on the situation type and location, the system will provide disaster-specific information and decision support. For example, a flooding event will require a different approach to COVID-19. S-HELP manages \"live\" disasters and allows users to review historical disasters for training and debriefs to leverage expertise and knowledge from past situations. The DSS also provides users with dynamic information management (IM) boards.FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSituation console/module where users can register and manage disaster eventsThese boards (Figure2) visualise and display incident-related information and guide the decision-making process during response.

The use of boards (often whiteboards) is common in EM. Digital boards allow for multiple participants, irrespective of location, to concurrently update the operational picture. Roles and permissions can be modified to assign observer-only access for community groups or enable active participation during the disaster.FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation management boards (data deliberately obscured)Although the boards are actively managed by a trained information manager, the situation log contains an immutable, timestamped copy of all data collected. It provides auditing capabilities, post-disaster, to review decisions and the data used. Information gathered on the IM boards can be used to identify the strategic aims, priorities and key issues to assign tasks. For example, a strategic aim might be to protect the health of the public, while a key priority could include lowering the surge of hospital admissions. A key issue might focus on preventing the spread of infections.

"use of technology therein prompt fundamental ethical dilemmas. However, the consideration of ethical issues may improve the likelihood of successful outcomes (Geale,2012). One of the paradoxes of technology is that as our dependence increases so too does our vulnerability (Heder,2017; Zack,2010). Equally problematic, and controversial, is the allocation of resources during a crisis (cf. Hardin,1996). We are seeing this scenario unfold in the COVID-19 crisis where personal protective equipment (PPEs) is in short supply (cf. Wallace et al.,2020). We may see a similar dilemma with respect to allocation of vaccine stocks. This scenario could be exacerbated by IS that utilise algorithms for decision-making, or predefined models for resource allocation. Decision-making algorithms have been used successfully in emergency medicine (cf. Widgren & Jourak,2011). However, the variability of disasters types and severity levels in EM present challenges (Pescaroli et al.,2018).It can be observed that many ethical frameworks exist both within and outside the domain of healthcare and EM (Geale,2012). In general, these frameworks explicitly state ethical values and articulate different processes and methods to assess technology in light of these values. In particular, ethical impact assessment frameworks provide means to assess the ethical soundness of new technologies (e.g., Wright,2011).

"light of these values. In particular, ethical impact assessment frameworks provide means to assess the ethical soundness of new technologies (e.g., Wright,2011). These approaches facilitate ethical assessments before, during and after the development of a technology, as well as influencing designs for new technologies (Reijers et al.,2018).The approach described in this paper incorporates elements of the aforementioned frameworks but extends each of them. Belanger and Crossler (2011) have criticised the contribution of information privacy research in the IS literature, and advocate approaches that incorporate design and action. In contrast to general ethical frameworks and those represented in the domain of healthcare/EM, our framework presents more detail on how ethical values influence the design process. This is similar to privacy-by-design approaches, but takes into account general ethical values, not only privacy. Ethical frameworks in the context of autonomous decision-making focus on the ethics of decisions solely made by software and how to assess them. However, our approach focuses on ethical decision-making as a combination of human and technical dimensions. This positioning is a unique characteristic of our ethical framework, as it presents details on the software design, and how general ethical values and considerations are reflected in a way that supports ethical decision-making in DSS.3 FRAMEWORK FOR CREATING AN ETHICS-BY-DESIGN APPROACHThis section presents a"
"framework, as it presents details on the software design, and how general ethical values and considerations are reflected in a way that supports ethical decision-making in DSS.3 FRAMEWORK FOR CREATING AN ETHICS-BY-DESIGN APPROACHThis section presents a framework for creating an ethics-by-design approach for computer applications in the context of EM and DSS. Such an approach addresses the ethical considerations and concerns of new computer applications in a holistic way. This is important, because traditional ethical rules are often ill suited to new technical solutions, which can lead to a policy vacuum (Moor,1985). Addressing this shortcoming, Gotterbarn (1999) proposed the creation of a dedicated ethics role so that ethical considerations are embedded in software development. These considerations lead to an ethics-by-design approach, where ethical policies as well as the innovation policy, or approach, are part of the developed software.In addition to classical computer ethics, which deals with the ethical use of computers, the ethics-by-design approach deals with design principles and guidelines so that the software itself follows ethical rules or supports humans to follow ethical rules (Gotterbarn et al.,1997). While Gotterbarn (1999) addresses the topic of integrating ethical considerations with computer applications, our approach incorporates the research and development (R&D) process that leads to the development of new applications.

"(1999) addresses the topic of integrating ethical considerations with computer applications, our approach incorporates the research and development (R&D) process that leads to the development of new applications. To achieve this, a framework has been elaborated that captures ethical aspects, relevant to EM, and provides guidelines on how to apply and verify an ethics-by-design approach throughout the R&D process.The key components of this framework are (a) a research and development process that provides anchors to integrate ethical design decisions, (b) the definition of the scope where ethical considerations are to be applied, (c) the methods to identify ethical requirements and values, (d) the elaboration of design principles that guide the research and development, and (e) a methodology for how to perform ethical assessments. Figure3presents and overviews of ethics by design framework.FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe diagram gives an overview of the ethical framework with its five key componentsThis framework has been elaborated and applied in the specific context of EM and DSS. However, the overall concept can be transferred and applied to other domains, as discussed in Section5. In particular, it serves as a guide for how to develop, apply and assess ethics-by-design in any other domain.3.1 Research and development processThe first part of the framework consists of the integration of ethical design decisions into the research and development (R&D) process."
"a guide for how to develop, apply and assess ethics-by-design in any other domain.3.1 Research and development processThe first part of the framework consists of the integration of ethical design decisions into the research and development (R&D) process. Overall, the ethics-by-design approach consists of a process that integrates EM R&D with ethical aspects relevant in this domain. These include the ethical values and ethical impact assessment, as used in existing ethical frameworks. Reijers et al. (2018) describe three types of methods for ethical impact assessment based on ethical values. These are ex-ante methods dealing with emerging technologies (e.g., anticipatory ethics of emerging technologies [Brey,2012]), ex-post methods dealing with existing technologies and intra methods dealing with technology design.Our framework takes up these three types of methods for impact assessment and aligns them closely with agile software development (cf. Agile Alliance,2001). The approach aims to elicit requirements and develop solutions through the collaborative effort of the development teams in cooperation with end-users and stakeholders (cf. Cockburn & Highsmith,2001; Ramesh et al.,2010).

It employs an adaptive and iterative approach with an emphasis on frequent delivery of working software (Lee & Xia,2010). Like the agile stage-gate hybrid model of software development (Cooper & Sommer,2016), our approach uses checkpoints, orethical stage-gates, to progress and adhere to ethical considerations.The ethical stage-gates are implemented periodically during the research and development process and incorporate a combination of three activities. First, ethical requirements are identified and translated to ethical values. Second, ethical design principles are elaborated so that they can be integrated in the software application and training. Third, an assessment is performed that reveals the ethical impact on society. Which activities are performed depends on the temporal placement of the ESGs in the R&D lifecycle (beginning, during, and the end of the R&D process). Initially, ethical requirements elicitation is the prevalent activity, which progresses into the formulation of ethical values later on. Ethical impact assessment is conducted with ex-ante methods to anticipate the impact at the beginning and applies ex-post assessment methods at the end. The elaboration of ethical design principles is prevalent during the R&D process, as they influence the implementation.It is important to mention that"
"methods to anticipate the impact at the beginning and applies ex-post assessment methods at the end. The elaboration of ethical design principles is prevalent during the R&D process, as they influence the implementation.It is important to mention that the three activities conducted at an ESG have a strong interplay. For example, an ethical impact assessment delivers ethical requirements that are used for creating design principles. In the initial planning phase of an R&D project, it should be specified how many ESGs are needed and when they occur. An overview of this framework with all these components is depicted in Figure3. The following subsections provide further details on the individual components of the framework.3.2 Scope and application domainThe second component of the ethical framework targets the identification of the scope and application context, where ethical considerations are to be applied. In our case, the application domain includes EM supported by DSS. Thus, the scope of ethical considerations includes the system to be developed, the training methodology, end-users and stakeholders affected by the system. The identification of scope and application context can be achieved with the help of scenarios tailored to the application domain. While traditional technology assessment focuses on policy makers, Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) follows a co-evaluative approach with a socially embedded research process that includes all stakeholders in"
"tailored to the application domain. While traditional technology assessment focuses on policy makers, Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) follows a co-evaluative approach with a socially embedded research process that includes all stakeholders in activities (Konrad et al.,2017). Like CTA, Social Impact Analysis (SIA) involves the key actors in the assessment, tries to prevent or repair negative consequences and considers social impacts in the design (Becker,2001). SIA applies a process that involves stakeholders in each step including, scenario design, impact analysis, mitigation of negative impacts, and reporting. Like CTA and SIA, our framework proposes the identification and integration of the main stakeholders. Our approach also proposes the creation of real-life scenarios. Following Konrad et al. (2017), the development starts with simple scenarios and then expands to explore different directions, situations and actors. Including well-defined scenarios and stakeholders will demonstrate how the software application is used. Scenarios facilitate the elicitation of ethical requirements, the creation of ethical design principles, and ethical impact assessment.In contrast to other ethical frameworks, our approach includes both technical and human dimensions, as well as the interaction between them. While Moor (1985) raises concerns about a policy vacuum in respect of how computers are used, Wright (2011) presents a framework for ethical impact assessment that seeks to"
"both technical and human dimensions, as well as the interaction between them. While Moor (1985) raises concerns about a policy vacuum in respect of how computers are used, Wright (2011) presents a framework for ethical impact assessment that seeks to address the problem. Though Wright's framework contains a broad overview of ethical values and assessment methods, it still focuses on the use of the technology. In our case, human decision-making is a central aspect of the application domain, which must be taken into account regarding the ethical design. Consequently, training activities that improve human decision-making skills are used. In EM, there are ethical implications associated with making sound decisions to avoid harm and making ethical decisions that consider the wider impact on society.Another aspect of current ethics-by-design approaches is ethical decision-making in artificial intelligence (AI). AI enables software to make autonomous decisions in a variety of situations such as autonomous vehicles (Hevelke & Nida-Rümelin,2015), personal digital assistants (Maedche et al.,2019), or healthcare robots (Van Wynsberghe,2016). Bak (2020) cautions that computer models and simulations are rarely morally neutral and highlights the importance of collaborating with stakeholders to incorporate ethical considerations \"by design.\" Dignum et al. (2018) outline a framework for ethical decision-making that focuses on accountability, transparency and understandability. They"
"highlights the importance of collaborating with stakeholders to incorporate ethical considerations \"by design.\" Dignum et al. (2018) outline a framework for ethical decision-making that focuses on accountability, transparency and understandability. They highlight the difference between human and machine-based decision-making by stating that decisions taken by machines must be justified, transparent, and explainable. Though our framework relies on human decision-making with the help of information systems, these aspects of autonomous decision-making should be taken into account, if the developed system contains smart or autonomous decision-making.3.3 Ethical requirements and valuesThe third component consists of the ethical requirements analysis, which progresses to ethical value definition. This process starts at the first ESG as a collection of ethical requirements. During subsequent refinement activities, at later ESGs, these requirements will be categorised and translated into a small set of ethical values. This process should be accompanied by a literature review of existing ethical frameworks that list ethical values relevant to the application domain (e.g., Wright,2011).Another important aspect of this step is its connection with the ethical impact assessments at the same ESGs. The outcome of the impact assessment is taken up as ethical requirements for the software and training design, which are then translated into functional or non-functional software requirements."
"with the ethical impact assessments at the same ESGs. The outcome of the impact assessment is taken up as ethical requirements for the software and training design, which are then translated into functional or non-functional software requirements. These requirements inform the creation of the ethical design principles (see next subsection). This clearly demonstrates the interplay between ethical impact assessment, requirements analysis and design principles that is the output of an ESG activity, performed during the R&D process, informs subsequent activities.The following ethical values were identified as relevant in the context of EM and decision-making. They resulted from both a literature review and focus groups with relevant stakeholders during the application of the ethics-by-design approach (see Section4). Though this set of values fits to the application domain of EM and DSS, it might be different in other application domains. The relevance of ethical values is articulated and summarised as follows:Transparency. The justification and ethical considerations for decisions made in response to a disaster must be transparent and comprehensible (Landesman,2012). The justification includes information on the circumstances and why and how the decisions have been made. Furthermore, all stakeholders should be included in the decision-making process, in order to make them aware of the reasons and potential risks of decisions (Upshur,2002). Decisions taken should be available"
"and why and how the decisions have been made. Furthermore, all stakeholders should be included in the decision-making process, in order to make them aware of the reasons and potential risks of decisions (Upshur,2002). Decisions taken should be available post-incident for debriefing and formal auditing. This is even more critical when decisions are made, or enabled, by algorithms. Though there is a perception that machines are infallible. Zarsky (2016) states that such a view is misguided. Rather, greater automation demands greater transparency (ibid). The importance of transparency is reiterated by Turilli and Floridi (2009) who state that transparency is a pro-ethical condition that can impair, or enable, other ethical practices and principles. Childress and Gaare Bernheim (2008) relate honest and truthful communication with the transparency principle.Responsiveness. The speed of access to information in EM is vital to minimise harm arising from a lack of resources. Responsiveness, as well as the adjunct values timeliness and rigour are most relevant for ensuring effective and high-quality EM (Hunt et al.,2016). Decisions should be reviewed and revised if required. Responsiveness is particularly relevant to system design as optimal performance in situational awareness is vital. Decisions made quickly can minimise harm, while delayed decisions might lead to increased harm in the time when no response to emergency is provided. A DSS should easily access the current"
"design as optimal performance in situational awareness is vital. Decisions made quickly can minimise harm, while delayed decisions might lead to increased harm in the time when no response to emergency is provided. A DSS should easily access the current operational picture/situation through a well-designed user interface.Reasonableness. Responders should base their decisions on science, empirical data, best practice, principles and experiential knowledge to ensure decisions are proportionate and appropriate (Geale,2012; Landesman,2012). However, in a pluralist society, people might disagree on what is reasonable, which can lead to a prioritisation problem (Daniels,2000). In the case of Personal Injury Evaluation Systems (PIES) and Judicial Support Systems (JSDSS), for example, there is evidence that judgements are being made by less well-trained assessors (Person,2000). Providing decision-makers with adequate training can help to address this.Data protection and privacy. The technical framework and security measures should be designed to guarantee that all personal data are safe from unforeseen, unintended or malevolent use (European Commission,2013). Privacy and confidentiality should be protected carefully in healthcare (Childress & Gaare Bernheim,2008). Privacy concerns several aspects of a person, including information about the anonymity, the communication, and the body of a person (Wright,2011). This is relevant for end-user participation, as it outlines how data are"
"(Childress & Gaare Bernheim,2008). Privacy concerns several aspects of a person, including information about the anonymity, the communication, and the body of a person (Wright,2011). This is relevant for end-user participation, as it outlines how data are processed and ensures that end-user privacy is respected. It relates to the training approach as trainee data need to be secured. The system design phase must incorporate steps and controls to assure confidentiality. The integrity and availability of the data created by, and pertaining to, decision makers must be secured.Justice and fairness. Justice incorporates equality and non-discriminatory principles. All stakeholders should receive equal access to healthcare and risks should be managed carefully, irrespective of race, age, gender and nationality. Scarce resources should be fairly distributed amongst victims (European Commission,2013; Landesman,2012). Benefits and burdens should be distributed equitably (Childress & Gaare Bernheim,2008) and limited resources should be distributed fairly (Geale,2012). This value relates to the system design and facilitates fair and blind EM. For example, a resource management tool should not allow decision-makers to prioritise a specific cohort.Precaution. Precaution must be taken in order to understand and assess risks in the emergency mitigation and planning phases. Precaution strongly relates to avoiding, preventing and removing harm (Childress & Gaare Bernheim,2008). Upshur (2002)"
"cohort.Precaution. Precaution must be taken in order to understand and assess risks in the emergency mitigation and planning phases. Precaution strongly relates to avoiding, preventing and removing harm (Childress & Gaare Bernheim,2008). Upshur (2002) argues that reducing public harm justifies interventions. However, such interventions should be taken with caution and must be justifiable. Limiting harm is also an ethical rule in disaster situations with limited resources (Geale,2012). An impact assessment of the risk of different disaster types should be performed in advance (European Commission,2013). This value relates to the training approach for developing decision-making competencies. Trainees should learn to assess the ramifications of decisions that are taken.Though listed as individual values, many of the values are interrelated. Daniels (2000), for example, argues that fair process will involve transparency about the grounds for decisions. While there are good reasons for all these principles, the application of public health intervention guided by these principles might conflict with the general value of liberty. Childress and Gaare Bernheim (2008) name five justificatory conditions for such interventions: effectiveness, necessity, least infringement, proportionality and impartiality.Legal issues are often considered in conjunction with ethical issues. Though transparency and data protection are ethical values, many countries have legal regulations pertaining to"
"necessity, least infringement, proportionality and impartiality.Legal issues are often considered in conjunction with ethical issues. Though transparency and data protection are ethical values, many countries have legal regulations pertaining to the transparency of decision-making and the protection of personal data. While legal aspects vary from country to country, ethical values are more general and often include legal aspects. Thus, the focus must be the ethical aspects. However, referring to legal aspects provides a valuable source of consideration.Humanitarian principles are closely tied to ethical aspects. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly Resolution 46/182 declares that humanitarian assistance must be provided with respect to principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. By adhering to these principles, practitioners can achieve a measure of accountability from the wider humanitarian community. As per the legal issues discussed above, humanitarian principles provide a source of identifying relevant ethical values.3.4 Ethical design principlesThe fourth component deals with the translation of ethical requirements and values into concrete design principles that inform and guide the software development and training activities. This translation is most relevant, as it inherently enriches software and training components with ethics that influences the human behaviour and usage of these components. However, the translation can be difficult and"
"development and training activities. This translation is most relevant, as it inherently enriches software and training components with ethics that influences the human behaviour and usage of these components. However, the translation can be difficult and time consuming. While some ethical requirements can take the form of functional software requirements that are easy to implement, others can take the form of non-functional requirements that do not provide clear instruction for implementation. Thus, a collaboration between the technical and ethical team members is needed for the formulation of ethical requirements as implementable design guidelines.This procedure is similar to the value-sensitive design (VSD), which aims to influence the technological design by explicitly identifying human values to be considered and integrated throughout the design process (Cummings,2006; Friedman et al.,2013). The formalised VSD methodology consists of a three-part iterative approach, which includes the investigation of conceptual, empirical and technical issues specific to a particular design. The conceptual investigation consists of an analysis informed by the philosophy of those value constructs relevant to the design in question. The technical investigation aims to assess how the technology supports particular values and how values identified in the conceptual investigation could be supported by different design possibilities. The empirical investigation focuses on human interaction"
"technical investigation aims to assess how the technology supports particular values and how values identified in the conceptual investigation could be supported by different design possibilities. The empirical investigation focuses on human interaction with the technology.Another example that pursues a similar approach to our framework is privacy-by-design, which seeks to integrate regulations and ethical rules in software design (cf. Cavoukian,2009; Cavoukian et al.,2010). It advocates an approach whereby systems should be designed and built with an emphasis on avoiding, or limiting, the amount of personal data that is processed (Schaar,2010). This approach was reinforced by the general data protection regulations (GDPR) that became enforceable in 2018 in the EU and became a model for many national laws outside the EU. GDPR includes several principles on the use of private and personal data, such as granting rights to the data subject (e.g., right to erase personal data) and ethical processing of personal data (e.g., anonymization, data minimization). Adopting these principles in phased software design and development leads to privacy-by-design approaches that integrate privacy principles in software design. In contrast to privacy-by-design that focuses on one specific value, our framework is open to other ethical values and promotes the identification of relevant ethical values.3.5 Ethical impact assessmentThe fifth component of the framework is the ethical impact"
"to privacy-by-design that focuses on one specific value, our framework is open to other ethical values and promotes the identification of relevant ethical values.3.5 Ethical impact assessmentThe fifth component of the framework is the ethical impact assessment. Typically, an ethical impact assessment investigates how the use of a product might negatively affect society (Wright & Friedewald,2013). In our framework, the ethical impact assessment has two distinct objectives. First, it should deliver ethical requirements that can be translated to design principles for the software and training as described in Sections3.3and3.4. Second, it should verify the ethical soundness of the final product. While the first goal is primarily achieved with impact assessments at an early stage of the R&D process, the latter goal is achieved with impact assessments at a later phase of the R&D process.In general, ethical impact assessment can be defined as a process during which an organisation, together with stakeholders, considers the ethical issues or impacts posed by a new project, technology, service, program, legislation, or other initiative, to identify risks and solutions (Wright & Friedewald,2013). An ethical impact assessment framework is presented by Wright (2011) that advocates the use of ethical impact assessments and provides a structure for undertaking such assessments.

"is presented by Wright (2011) that advocates the use of ethical impact assessments and provides a structure for undertaking such assessments. It consists of a collection of ethical principles (values) that should be considered and provides questions to assess whether these principles have been adhered to. The second part of the structure is a set of tools that can be used by decision-makers to engage stakeholders in considering the principles, values and issues. Examples are expert workshops, checklists of questions, ethical matrix, or citizen panels and real-world disaster scenarios for EM preparation, response, debriefs and training.Our framework involves stakeholders in the aforementioned exercises to perform impact assessment. However, while existing ethical frameworks and methods focus on either ex-ante or ex-post methods (Reijers et al.,2018), our approach includes the whole spectrum of ethical assessments. This has the advantage of applying ethical aspects throughout the development lifecycle. Ex-ante methods are employed at an earlier R&D phase and are characterised by conducting workshops or focus groups that involve a small number of stakeholders, which are more effective in discussing and creating new ideas. Ex-post methods are conducted at a later R&D phase and involve larger stakeholder groups with stakeholders from different areas and of different types. This ensures a sound and complete ethical verification. Ex-ante methods inform the formulation of"
"Ex-post methods are conducted at a later R&D phase and involve larger stakeholder groups with stakeholders from different areas and of different types. This ensures a sound and complete ethical verification. Ex-ante methods inform the formulation of requirements and values, and the design of the product. Ex-post methods verify the ethical soundness of the final product.The framework proposes the use of task and scenario-based methodologies in both focus groups and studies. Task-based exercises require more precise and in-depth work from the participants, because they have to deliver results. Through the use of realistic scenarios, the tasks are not abstract, and stakeholders can do the assessment from their viewpoint (different for each stakeholder group) related to a concrete situation. A scenario consists of five basic elements: (1) the nature of the disaster for example, what, where, when and who? (2) ground rules and logistical factors (3) participant roles and stakeholders (4) scenario objectives; and (5) complicating factors or setbacks (Alexander,2000). Although this study used scenarios for ethical evaluation, the use of scenarios for IS development is well established (Sutcliffe,2003). Furthermore, the use of mock-ups, draft screenshots, pencil-and-paper approaches allows an assessment before the implementation (Beynon-Davies et al.,1999; Camburn et al.,2017).

In particular, the requirements analysis and creation of design principles are undertaken before an implementation.4 APPLYING ETHICS-BY-DESIGN IN THE S-HELP APPROACH FOR MANAGING EMERGENCIESThis section describes the practical application of the ethical framework and its integration with the R&D of the S-HELP project. This project aimed to develop a DSS and methodology for multi-agency decision-making during large-scale emergencies to support rapid and effective DM across all stages of EM (Neville et al.,2016). Beside the development of a system consisting of various tools for supporting the whole decision-making process in emergency situations, research has been undertaken to train decision-makers in the use of the system. This section describes the overall approach and details of how the ethical framework has been applied. In doing so, it provides a means through which researchers, creating applications in different domains, can adapt the framework to implement their own adapted ethics-by-design approach.The first step consisted of the identification of the relevant stakeholders. In the S-HELP project, the stakeholders comprised researchers and practitioners in the field of public health, EM and decision-making.

"In the S-HELP project, the stakeholders comprised researchers and practitioners in the field of public health, EM and decision-making. Additionally, as potential victims of a disaster, the public and local population were deemed to constitute a stakeholder group that is affected by the outcomes of the project.The R&D process was planned with three ethical stage gates (ESGs), one at the beginning of the project, one in the middle and one at the end. At the first ESG, an initial ethical requirement elicitation and ex-ante impact assessment was conducted by the project members and relevant stakeholders. This resulted in the formulation of an initial set of ethical requirements and design principles:User participation needs to be regulated by privacy and data protection practices, such as the use of informed consent forms, as well as respect of anonymity in user studies, workshops and training sessions.User interfaces should be designed in a way that end-users can quickly and easily access EM information, especially in stress conditions.The proper and effective use of the DSS in EM situations needs trained end-users (decision-makers in EM).The effect of the use of the DSS in EM should avoid harm to society or at least minimise and balance non-avoidable harm.At the second ESG, and after the initial development phase, a focus group workshop was conducted to undertake the first ethical review including a further ethical impact assessment, ethical requirements elicitation, and an"
"and balance non-avoidable harm.At the second ESG, and after the initial development phase, a focus group workshop was conducted to undertake the first ethical review including a further ethical impact assessment, ethical requirements elicitation, and an exercise for elaborating design principles. The workshop included experts in the field of decision-making, ethics, EM and public health. The group was presented with the system user interface (UI) wireframes along with scenarios detailing how the system could be used. Participants were then asked to analyse the existing and planned features regarding their ethical impact on society, to identify relevant ethical values and to elaborate design recommendations (listed in Table2). The recommendations were summarised and categorised according to six ethical values (see Table2). These ethical values were first identified on the basis of a literature review and subsequently approved by the focus group participants.TABLE  2.Overview of how ethical values are applied in different fieldsEthical valueSystem designTraining approachTransparencyThe system provides a mechanism to record what decisions have been made to facilitate subsequent justification of unpopular decisions.The Situation Log Module records this information.Trainees are made aware that their decisions and activities are recorded by the system for later reviewResponsivenessThe user interface facilitates convenient and quick access to critical information.

Notifications on the RCS module (information management boards) alert participants to changes and updates. Quick and timely access to information is especially important during emergencies.A training module allows users to practice accessing critical information, to familiarise themselves with the systems capabilities of providing quick access to emergency information.ReasonablenessThe system provides relevant information on the current emergency situation in order to get a full picture of an emergency. The knowledge management (KM) module provides decision-makers with access to relevant standard operation procedures and emergency plans. This helps decision-makers to make decisions in a reasonable way.Stakeholders who are responsible for making decisions are trained to make appropriate decisions. A decision-making training program has been set up for this purpose.Data protection and privacyData gathered from victims and decision-makers are protected.

"from patient data and data from decision-makers is only available to their supervisors.The training includes information about the privacy rights of victims. Furthermore, information relating to trainees and their training progress is visible only to trainees.Justice and fairnessThe system facilitates access to all relevant emergency information (e.g., human, health and first responder resources, situation overview, geographic information), which is a prerequisite for fair decisions. Several modules support this access including, the Weather Module, the Geographic Information System and the Situation Module.The training emphasises that a core goal of EM is to avoid harm and that a good overview of the current situation supports balanced decisions. The decision-making training helps understand decision alternatives and the consequences of such decisions on society. Furthermore, trainees are trained to take all available emergency information into account.PrecautionThe knowledge management module surfaces related past incidents so that decision-makers can leverage past experience on current incidents. The use of modelling, such as flood and chemical plume models, help decision-makers assess the impact of decision alternatives before actually making decisions.End-users tasked with decision-making are trained in decision-making to enhance the understanding of decision alternatives and consequences, which ensures decisions are made with care whilst considering the ramifications"
"before actually making decisions.End-users tasked with decision-making are trained in decision-making to enhance the understanding of decision alternatives and consequences, which ensures decisions are made with care whilst considering the ramifications of such decisions.The recommendations from the focus group and literature review were categorised on the basis of the values identified in the literature review. To facilitate transparency, the focus group recommended that all decisions taken during an incident should be recorded. To ensure responsiveness, the focus group recommend the creation of an accurate informational picture that would be customised depending on the incident type and user role. Reasonableness was considered both in terms of access to relevant knowledge and ensuring adequate training for decision-makers. In order to ensure data protection and privacy, the focus group recommended securing the storage of, and access to, personal data. Furthermore, it was recommended that only data from trustworthy sources should be considered for decision-making. The latter was to be considered when displaying live data from social channels for example, Twitter. To uphold justice and fairness, the focus group recommended providing decision-makers with access to relevant data on environmental conditions, local infrastructure and vulnerable members of the community.

"providing decision-makers with access to relevant data on environmental conditions, local infrastructure and vulnerable members of the community. It was recommended that decision-makers should also be trained to evaluate the consequences of decision alternatives. Finally, the system should ensure that all decisions avoid, or minimise, inflicting harm on affected people and victims.Based on the recommendations, design principles have been elaborated that inform the system and training design. An overview of the most relevant principles is presented in Table2.The final ethical stage-gate incorporated an evaluation to determine if the ethical values, previously outlined, were appropriately and sufficiently incorporated in the system. This evaluation was conducted over the course of three scenario evaluations (biological scenario, flood scenario, chemical scenario) with experts from EM and healthcare. Tremblay et al. (2010) recommend adapting focus groups for design research incorporating exploratory focus groups and confirmatory focus groups. Although an exploratory focus group was conducted in this study, a confirmatory focus group was not possible.

"values represented only one component of the multiple evaluations that were being conducted across the three scenarios. A survey approach was chosen because it could be conducted after the system technical evaluation had taken place. As such, it was complimentary to the scenario evaluations. The use of a survey, on conclusion of the technical evaluation, fulfilled some of the benefits gained through confirmatory focus groups. It facilitated the evaluation of design decisions, tested the system in realistic scenarios and leveraged the expertise of practitioners and those familiar with the application environment. A limitation of this approach is that this evaluation could not be compared with a control group, because a setting with A/B testing would have required a second system that has not integrated the ethics-by-design approach.This section presented an example of how the ethics-by-design framework has been applied in the S-HELP project. It serves as an example of the flexibility in instantiating the framework. Instead of following the framework's process sequentially, the actual implementation diverged in certain aspect. Figure4illustrates the outcome of the ethics-by-design approach on the S-HELP project.FIGURE 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe ethics-by-design approach as demonstrated in the S-HELP project5 CONCLUSIONSThis paper discussed a framework for applying an ethics-by-design approach that has been developed and implemented in the context of a 3-year funded"

Systems to manage large-scale cross-border disasters presents profound ethical challenges. The creation of systems to meet such needs requires sensitivity to ethical issues whilst ensuring decision-makers can be empowered to make decisions quickly. Given that EM is a multi-phase longitudinal process, decision support must ensure that \"good\" decisions are considered, whilst taking follow-up actions into account. In simple terms, decisions that are enabled by such systems can have profound, and often unintended, societal consequences. It is beholden on the designers of such systems to embed ethical principles in the design, and consider the ethical implications surfaced in training and the use of such systems. Access, or lack thereof, to digital technologies can contribute to second-order disasters that can further exacerbate the precarity of already disadvantaged citizens (Madianou,2015). An approach to ISD that incorporates ethics-by-design could help mitigate such outcomes.The holistic framework presented in this paper provides a pragmatic way to address ethical concerns.

"could help mitigate such outcomes.The holistic framework presented in this paper provides a pragmatic way to address ethical concerns. The framework provides a process, applied in the EM and DSS domain, to operationalise an ethics-by-design approach for artefact creation. Its application in the S-HELP project demonstrates its usefulness and applicability, while the summative evaluation demonstrates its validity. The key concepts of the framework are built on existing concepts in the field of ethical frameworks and ethical impact assessment.This paper makes multiple contributions. The articulation of an ethics-by-design approach shifts the IS discourse on design towards a more practical, ethics-based footing. In doing so, it builds on the growing body of literature pertaining to ethics and technology design and use. Second, the ethics-by-design approach can be applied to other contexts. The approach guides the selection of ethical values and demonstrates replicable strategies for evaluating ethical design that considers the perspective of multiple stakeholders. Such an approach would be particularly prudent for designers of systems that incorporate algorithms, or artificial intelligence, for decision-making irrespective of application domain.

"application domain. The paper contributes to theory by elaborating on Gotteborn's ethics-by-design approach through its practical application in a large-scale R&D project. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the DSS literature through design guidelines for systems design and decision-making training.The framework approach builds on an agile software development process and its key components. While the agile software development process influences the ethics-by-design approach, there is also a reciprocal effect. Incorporating the ethics-by-design approach in the agile software development methodology advances the quality and feature of the agile approach. Since the agile methodology is already widely adopted and used in software development projects, it could serve as a method to make the ethics-by-design approach tangible for many projects dealing with societal aspects. Considering that ethics-by-design has rarely been applied in practice, there is significant scope for impact of our approach.This paper contributes to literature on ethical frameworks and ethical impact analysis. While existing ethical frameworks focus rather solely on ex-ante, intra, or ex-post methods for ethical impact analysis (Reijers et al.,2018), our approach includes the whole spectrum of ethical assessments.

"approach includes the whole spectrum of ethical assessments. Ex-ante methods dealing with emerging technologies (\"anticipatory ethics of emerging technologies\") focus on the assessment of technology that has not been developed so far (cf. Brey,2012). In our approach, this is performed at the first ethical stage-gate, in order to obtain ethical requirements for the technology to be developed. Intra methods, such as value sensitive design are used to influence the technical design based on human and ethical values. These are applied once, or multiple times, during the research and development process. Ex-post methods dealing with the assessment of existing technology are applied through the summative ethical evaluation at the last ethical stage-gate. Together with the use of scenarios and integration of all relevant stakeholders, these methods constitute a holistic framework.Though the framework incorporates several methods and concepts previously discussed in the ethics literature, it enriches the existing literature with two distinct features. First, it combines these methods into a holistic framework and applies meaningful sequencing. In this way, the individual methods benefit from each other, which brings additional value to the whole framework. Furthermore, the framework provides structure and guidance on how to apply these methods to achieve an ethics-by-design approach.

"to the whole framework. Furthermore, the framework provides structure and guidance on how to apply these methods to achieve an ethics-by-design approach. Such an approach should prove especially useful for designers and developers who are not experienced in applying ethics whilst assuring end-users on the provision of ethical solutions. The second distinct feature is the role of stakeholders in the ethics-by-design approach. Traditional ethical frameworks focus on the ethical use of a technology and how technology can be designed such that it can be used in an ethical way. However, well-designed technology can still be used in a harmful way by untrained users. To mitigate this, our approach demonstrates how stakeholders, including technology users, can be included in the ethics-by-design approach. This extended focus represents a more complete ethical design.The outcome of this paper, the framework for creating an ethics-by-design approach and its practical application, have the potential to be used in different contexts and application domains that deserve ethical attention. First, future R&D projects in the field of EM and DSS can adopt much of the process described in the framework. Even the identified ethical values could be reused. However, caution is required as a further refinement or differences in the application domain might lead to slight deviations in the resulting ethical values. Second, R&D projects in other fields can take up the overall process and adapt it"
"be reused. However, caution is required as a further refinement or differences in the application domain might lead to slight deviations in the resulting ethical values. Second, R&D projects in other fields can take up the overall process and adapt it to their needs. Since many of the framework components are well understood (e.g.,agiledevelopment process, requirements elicitation, focus groups, evaluations), they can be adapted to meet the project's characteristics, in order to integrate ethics-by-design.Although digital technology has the potential to transform our everyday lives, and society at large, such technology brings ethical issues to the fore. Royakkers et al. (2018), analysed the scientific literature on six dominant technologies: Internet of Things, robotics, biometrics, persuasive technology, virtual & augmented reality, and digital platforms. The analysis revealed many of these technologies were problematic in respect of ethical and societal values. The analysis demonstrates that it is necessary to address such concerns. Since computer models and simulations are rarely morally neutral, there is an even greater need to collaborate with stakeholders to incorporate ethical considerations \"by design\" (Bak,2020). Moreover, due to cognitive limitations of ethical behaviour (Gigerenzer,2010), humans need to be supported for the ethical use of a technology. Beyond merely promoting awareness for these challenges, technology makers need tools and methodologies to tackle"
"due to cognitive limitations of ethical behaviour (Gigerenzer,2010), humans need to be supported for the ethical use of a technology. Beyond merely promoting awareness for these challenges, technology makers need tools and methodologies to tackle ethical concerns in a practical way without unnecessarily limiting functionality and economic value. The framework presented in this paper provides a means to address this challenge, as it offers a practical and flexible method that can be adapted in different contexts.However, the sheer variety and reach of emerging technologies also introduces one of the limitations of our approach. In contrast to EM and DSS where a small number of decision-makers can be trained, the users of mass technologies are ordinary consumers that cannot be reached for explicit training. However, there is still the potential for software to offer user training, which could be elaborated in a careful design. Another limitation concerns the human aspect of decision-making. Decision-making in autonomous systems and robots is often based on artificial intelligence technology. Even though the role of the user controlling these devices is limited, an even greater need for a careful ethics-by-design is necessary. A final limitation lies in the acceptance of applying ethics in the design in general. Commercial producers of technology might be reluctant to address ethics if a reduction in the number of features leads to a potential decrease in economic value.The"
"A final limitation lies in the acceptance of applying ethics in the design in general. Commercial producers of technology might be reluctant to address ethics if a reduction in the number of features leads to a potential decrease in economic value.The findings of this paper can be used by other research-driven software projects, outside of the context of EM, to integrate ethical considerations. Though EM has specific ethical requirements that lead to the set of identified ethical values, the same process would lead to other ethical values relevant in other domains and their integration in the technology design. The benefits of exploring analogous settings as a source of inspiration and innovation have been widely discussed (cf. Franke et al.,2014; Poetz & Prügl,2010). One could draw comparisons between the extreme needs of EM practitioners and the lead user concept (cf. Von Hippel,1986). As such, EM represents a fertile research domain both for IS, in general, and the application of novel approaches to ethics research specifically.This project [S-HELP] has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no (607865).BiographiesAlexander Nussbaumeris a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science (ISDS) at the Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), Austria.

"AbstractBased on the in-depth study of two technologies, wireless sensor network, and RFID technology, this paper proposes a corresponding solution to the urgent storage positioning problem and the safety of goods in transit in the logistics supply chain process. And on this basis, it broadens the whole logistics process of warehousing and distribution and designs a framework of intelligent logistics supply chain management system with wireless sensor network and RFID technology to realize the management process of logistics main business. For the problems of complicated hardware wiring, the excessive number of positioning nodes and low effective coverage rate of traditional RFID-based positioning methods in large-scale warehousing environment, the integrated RFID and wireless sensor network fusion technology constructs a new movable anchor node, divides the nodes in the traditional positioning process into fixed anchors and mobile anchors, proposes a secondary positioning method, improves positioning accuracy and effective coverage rate, and provides a new positioning method for large-scale storage environment. For the transportation of goods in transit, especially precious and dangerous goods, a six-axis acceleration sensor-based method for detecting the behavioral attitude of goods in transit is proposed. Time window slicing of cargo motion data stream is performed to reduce data processing and based on the statistical features of a large amount of experimental data, and"
"method for detecting the behavioral attitude of goods in transit is proposed. Time window slicing of cargo motion data stream is performed to reduce data processing and based on the statistical features of a large amount of experimental data, and feature vectors and classifiers are analyzed and designed to achieve behavioral attitude classification of goods in transit. The experiment proves that this method has high recognition accuracy and has certain practical application value. Finally, the whole storage and distribution logistics process is integrated, the framework of intelligent logistics supply chain management system combining WSN and RFID is built based on wireless sensor network software and hardware platform, and the detailed design of logistics supply chain management system business process is mainly carried out. Combined with the two key methods proposed in this paper, the information management process of traditional logistics business such as access, storage positioning and monitoring, and distribution monitoring and management is realized, and the management system is tested on this basis. The testing effect proves that this system has certain deployment reference significance and practical application value and to a certain extent can help improve the intelligence level of logistics supply chain management and achieve the expected goal of this study.1.

"and to a certain extent can help improve the intelligence level of logistics supply chain management and achieve the expected goal of this study.1. IntroductionThe rationalization of information technology and equipment selection should first clarify the logistics supply chain information collection object. Logistics information includes two aspects, not only the information related to logistics activities but also the information related to other circulation activities [1]. Logistics information has the function of supporting and guaranteeing the storage and transportation operations and related logistics management activities and plays the role of integrating resources to improve efficiency. Logistics supply chain information also has the general characteristics of logistics information, and the management of logistics supply chain information should collect, organize, transmit, store, and utilize the relevant information of the whole process. Logistics supply chain informationization not only includes information management and transmission of warehousing and transportation but also includes support for various decision-making activities and management applications in the process, making full use of information technology, collecting, transmitting, and analyzing data flow to achieve the purpose of controlling and supervising it. The effective management of logistics supply chain information is a reliable means and way to achieve the goal of the logistics supply chain"
"collecting, transmitting, and analyzing data flow to achieve the purpose of controlling and supervising it. The effective management of logistics supply chain information is a reliable means and way to achieve the goal of the logistics supply chain [2,3]. The object of logistics supply chain information management not only includes the basic information required for safety management and logistics operation but also includes the state information and characteristic information reflected by the basic information. This shows that the research on intelligent management and application of logistics supply chain should also focus on the information collection object in the process of logistics supply chain informatization and reasonably choose the informatization technology according to the information collection object, application scenario, and other factors to ensure the scientific and realistic nature of intelligent management and application [4].The level of intelligent operation of the information system is limited by the scientific degree of the solution method of the related decision problems involved. Therefore, to bring into play the efficiency of intelligent operation of the information system, the information system should be constructed based on recognizing the essence of the related decision problems involved in the logistics supply chain, reshaping the solution and method of the decision problems, and guaranteeing the scientificity of the solution method of the"
