According to the discussion in the previous section, ln (real price) is used as a target variable, and ln (real time), ln (contracted time), ln (contracted price), and purpose of the facility are used as predictors.

"have demonstrated in many cases better results than when applying only one of them. Lee et al. [48] proposed a hybrid ANN (artificial neural network) called GRNNFA, which is a combination of fuzzy adaptive resonance theory model (FA) and the general regression neural network model (GRNN), developed for classification of noise data. The model removes the noise that is embedded in the training data and retains the best features of the two single models, fast training, good learning, and a network with an incremental growing structure. The performance of this hybrid model, when compared to the other published results, presented better results. The accuracy of predicting was around 96.11%.To solve the issue of large-scale data, Wang et al. [49] proposed the TSE-GRNNs (tree-structure ensemble general regression neural networks) model. First, small-scale sample subsets are constructed using the regression tree algorithm. After that, GRNN submodels are constructed on these sample subsets, followed by the application of TSE-GRNNs method to establish the predictive model. Experiments show excellent predictive results.Other authors also used ANN for predicting construction costs.The authors in [50] used ANN to predict construction cost for apartment projects in Vietnam and obtained accuracy of the model with MAPE about 10%.

"cost for apartment projects in Vietnam and obtained accuracy of the model with MAPE about 10%. They compared the ANN model with multiple linear regression (MLR) model and genetic algorithm model (GA), and the best accuracy was obtained with the ANN.The author Juszczyk [13] uses several types of MLP to model the cost estimation of the construction works (residential buildings). The mean average percentage error (MAPE) for the validation data for the 5 MLP NN was from about 7% to 13%.It is very important to mention that the accuracy of the model depends mostly on the selection of appropriate predictors for the chosen target variable and the selection of the appropriate ANN or some other regression models.The authors in [14] have proposed data-driven methods for cost estimation of spherical storage tanks projects, based on the application of ANNs and hybridized regression models with genetic algorithm (GA), without using ANNs. The variables used in these models were thickness, tank diameter, and length of the weld. They have used two types of NNs (multilayer perceptrons): with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMNN) and Bayesian regulated (BRNN). The results have shown that both ANNs have performed better than hybridized regression models without using ANNs. LMNN has shown better estimation than BRNN. The correlation between real data and predicted values was more than 90%, and the mean square error was around 0.4. Author's future work is focused on the comparison between this"
"models without using ANNs. LMNN has shown better estimation than BRNN. The correlation between real data and predicted values was more than 90%, and the mean square error was around 0.4. Author's future work is focused on the comparison between this proposed model and another ANN hybridized with a metaheuristic such as GA, Bees algorithm, Ant Colony algorithm, or Artificial Bee Colony algorithm.The author Badawy [51] has proposed hybrid model for estimation of the cost of residential buildings in Egypt. Real data were used from 174 real residential projects. The proposed model was composed of ANN model and multiple linear regression models. The MAPE of the hybrid model was 10.64% which was less than other hybrid models developed in the research. The analysis has shown that the most important factors in the cost prediction were the number of floors and the area of the floors.In relation to DSS system, the parameters of the GRNN model can be stored in CPS: minimal and maximal sigma values, validation method (cross-validation with 10-fold), the type of kernel function, and then the parameters of the optimization algorithm of GRNN (number of iterations and absolute and relative convergence tolerance). Also, another recommendation before developing the model with some of the predictive models from the CPS system is to verify the data if the values of the input data have significant differences among them.

"before developing the model with some of the predictive models from the CPS system is to verify the data if the values of the input data have significant differences among them. If this is the case, then normalization of the data can be made before developing the predictive model. Also, the authors believe that in near future software can be developed which can select and try every predictive model from the CPS system and choose the most appropriate for the actual data.7. ConclusionsDue to the complex cost estimation problems in the field of building construction, lack of data, uncertainty, and risks, especially in the initial phases of the project, the model of the cost prediction system (CPS) as a part of the comprehensive Building Management Information System is proposed. On the one hand, the CPS uses historical data on implemented projects and a database of appropriate parameters, and on the other hand, several models of cost prediction are based on intelligent prediction techniques. These techniques have already been tested in solving various problems of the construction industry. The paper presents CPS ontology with the indicated basic components. The NNs are singled out as especially suitable. The reasons are explained in detail. The paper analyzes the cost estimation with a concrete database using a hybrid model which is a combination of process-based Bromilow model and data-driven GRNN network using the DTREG software.

"in detail. The paper analyzes the cost estimation with a concrete database using a hybrid model which is a combination of process-based Bromilow model and data-driven GRNN network using the DTREG software. Accuracy with MAPE of 0.73% was obtained, with coefficient of determinationR2of 99.5% and correlation coefficient of 0.998. The results were compared with the results obtained using other prognostic models with ANNs, by applying the same software. The presented processing in the proposed model would be enabled through the CPS system components and the stored data would be used. Processing results are stored in the system and used in future processing. Processing results are stored in the Decision Support System and used in future cost estimates and decision-making. The analysis and comparison of partial use of software with those included in the cost prediction system indicate a significant time saving and an increase in the quality of the assessment in the latter case.Therefore, the authors find the proposed model as a useful tool for all participants in the construction project for early cost prediction, when numerous factors, which determine cost, are unknown.Finally, the authors believe that research results, particularly the experience of process-based and data-driven models combination, as well as the proposed CPS model as support for decision-making contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of cost prediction for construction projects.The development of the"
"the experience of process-based and data-driven models combination, as well as the proposed CPS model as support for decision-making contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of cost prediction for construction projects.The development of the proposed cost prediction system should be the subject of future research. A special emphasis in future research should be put on the development of hybrid models. This concept can be applied more widely and can also cover the problem of predicting the duration of construction projects in the early stages.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partly supported by the University of Rijeka under the project uniri-tehnic-18-125.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe authors declare that data supporting the results reported in this paper can be found in the authors' databases.

"AbstractThis paper reports from a qualitative case study in the Gambian education sector. The study applies an affordance perspective to the ongoing strengthening of the national education management information system. Our analysis distinguishes between micro-level technology-use affordances (e.g., civil servants using IT for data capture and reporting), meso-level information system (IS) affordances (e.g., data-driven decision making at the organizational level), and macro-level affordances, which include policy interventions to ensure the attainment of education sector goals. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, the paper introduces a stepwise framework for IS affordance identification in terms of granularity levels (micro, meso and macro). Second, the paper outlines how use of IT at the micro-level allows for the actualization of meso-level IS affordances, which in turn serve as a foundation for the articulation of higher-level interventions. Far too often, ICT for development (ICT4D) projects focus on putting technology in the hands of users with the assumption that \"better data\" will drive development. The significant work involved in identifying and actualizing meso-level IS affordances is often not explicated and recognized in related plans and budgets.

By highlighting meso-level IS affordance actualizations, the paper explicates the link between public sector IT adoption and use and intended societal-level impact, which remains a key policy and research concern.1 INTRODUCTIONThis paper reports from a qualitative case study in the Gambian education sector. It applies an affordance perspective to highlight the role of information and communication technology (ICT) use in informing education sector interventions and monitoring progress toward national development goals, which include the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). The Gambian Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE) has launched an education management information system (EMIS) strengthening initiative, leveraging DHIS21as its digitalization backbone. Developed and maintained by the ISP Center at the University of Oslo, DHIS2 has, since its inception in the early 90s, emerged as a digital global public good software platform and is currently used as a foundational health management information system (HMIS) in more than 70 countries. The Gambia has used DHIS2 in the health sector since 2010. Motivated by success stories from the health sector in terms of health data availability and use, MoBSE, in 2019, embarked on a DHIS2-based EMIS implementation.

"of health data availability and use, MoBSE, in 2019, embarked on a DHIS2-based EMIS implementation. A pertinent question, then, is what action possibilities does this proven digital platform from the health sector afford the education sector?Affordance perspectives have grown in popularity in the information systems (IS) community. In IS research, affordances are considered action possibilities that arise in/from the relationship between an actor (or group of actors) and ICT (e.g., Volkoff & Strong,2013). In addition to relying on the actor and the ICT, the actualization of an affordance also depends on the context in which the actor and the ICT are embedded, sometimes recognized in terms of facilitating conditions.Information systems scholars have previously argued that affordances can be identified at different levels of granularity (Leidner et al.,2018; Strong et al.,2014; Volkoff & Strong,2017). Furthermore, scholars hold that it is advisable to differentiate between lower-level and higher-level affordances. Lower-level affordances are related to direct technology use and can be readily observed and perceived. Higher-level affordances emerge as a result of the actualization of lower-level affordances. Affordances on a higher granularity level are arguably of greater interest to the study of information systems and organizational change, while lower-level affordances have been the key interest of human-computer interaction (HCI) scholars.

"granularity level are arguably of greater interest to the study of information systems and organizational change, while lower-level affordances have been the key interest of human-computer interaction (HCI) scholars. Hence, Leidner et al. (2018) urge IS researchers to focus on affordances on a granularity level higher than mere technology-use. Along the same vein, Volkoff and Strong (2017) encourage IS researchers to identify and study affordances on an appropriate level of granularity. Yet, they offer no clear guidance to IS researchers on how to do so.To account for affordances that emerge from organizational actors' interaction with organizational IT capabilities, rather than an individual's specific interactions with a particular technology feature, we introduce the notion of meso-level affordances as an affordance granularity level situated between low- and high-level affordances, which we here refer to as micro- and macro-level affordances. We hold that the establishment of an affordance perspective that recognizes three levels of abstraction adds clarity to the study of affordances associated with complex and situated information systems. We contend that meso-level affordances emerge from the actualization of one or more micro-level affordances and constitute a prerequisite for the emergence and actualization of macro-level affordances.

"one or more micro-level affordances and constitute a prerequisite for the emergence and actualization of macro-level affordances. Macro-level affordances are in turn potentials for action that are instrumental in the attainment of goals at the level of an organizational field or society. However, macro-level affordances would typically not be traceable to direct interaction between a human agent and ICT.The unclear causal relation between ICT and development, or societal change, has informed extensive debate concerning the \"4\" in ICT4D. An affordance perspective offers no simple pathway to explaining the causality between ICTs and development. Yet, it offers a consistent terminology that highlights the inherently relational and emergent nature of ICT enabled action possibilities. To date, there is no unified framework for how to identify and distinguish micro-level affordances from meso- and macro-level affordances. This paper introduces a framework for affordance identification in terms of granularity levels.The key contribution of the paper is a novel articulation of IS affordances at different levels of granularity. We demonstrate how this layered affordance view can be operationalized to carefully assess and question the relationship between IT appropriation and envisioned development outcomes.

"relationship between IT appropriation and envisioned development outcomes. The practical motivation for our study is the need to better articulate the relationship between IT and action possibilities at different levels of granularity. From the analysis of empirical data, we find that meso-level IS affordances, which are often not explicitly recognized or problematized, play a critical role in the attainment of higher-level societal goals. In our case these goals are represented by The Gambia national education sector goals and SDG 4 on equitable quality education. The paper thus addresses Essen and Värlander's (2019) call for research on \"micro-level processes through which technology can transform not only organizational but also larger-scale social structures\" (p. 1174). Our research also answers Strong et al.'s (2014) call for further research on \"the emergence of organizational level actualization from individual level actualization journeys\" (p. 80). The following research question motivated the research reported on in this paper:How can the identification of IS affordances at three distinct levels improve our understanding of the relationship between IT adoption and use and the attainment of envisioned development goals?The paper proceeds as follows.

A description of relevant affordance theory development in the IS field follows. Thereafter we describe the qualitative case study methodology employed for this study. Subsequently the findings and discussions are presented before we offer some final concluding remarks.2 STRENGTHENING EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIESPrior research has highlighted how ICT projects in LMICs are notoriously prone to failure and fraught with sustainability issues (Ali & Bailur,2007; Best & Kumar,2008; Kleine & Unwin,2009; Marais,2015; Sanner,2017; Sanner & Sæbø,2014). This has been problematized in terms of design-reality gaps (Heeks,2002), failure to build sufficient local capacity to maintain and nurture technology interventions (Sanner et al.,2014), lack of institutionalization (Sahay et al.,2010), problematic incentive structures (Sanner & Sæbø,2014) and weak information culture, to mention a few. There is often a naïve technology determinism attached to many externally supported ICT initiatives in LMICs, in that much emphasis is placed on the procurement and distribution of technology and training of end users in the use of basic IT features, such as data capture, while the establishment of arenas and procedures for organization-wide utilization of the rich digital data, such as revision of organizational procedures,"
"of technology and training of end users in the use of basic IT features, such as data capture, while the establishment of arenas and procedures for organization-wide utilization of the rich digital data, such as revision of organizational procedures, workflow reengineering, articulation of new data management roles and mandates, or data-driven policy development, is often an afterthought, rather than a core implementation focus. IT appropriation and use is often assumed to have long-term impact on development of public sector interventions, without much consideration of how data-driven decision-making should be nurtured and actualized at the organizational level. The general trends outlined above are also reflected in the past 20 years of EMIS strengthening initiatives in LMICs (Abdul-Hamid et al.,2015; Cassidy,2006; UNICEF East Asia & Pacific,2020).Although EMISs have been around for decades, they are surprisingly understudied in IS research. Perhaps have their development trajectory been too mundane and too stagnant to attract much interest, although their potential role in shaping the education sector in LMICs cannot be overstated. There is a significant amount of gray literature on EMIS and EMIS strengthening (e.g., Cassidy,2006; Wako,2003). From an IS research perspective, an EMIS is not only the computerized system used to collect, manage and analyze data, but constitutes the entire national education data ecosystem (UNESCO,2020).

"Wako,2003). From an IS research perspective, an EMIS is not only the computerized system used to collect, manage and analyze data, but constitutes the entire national education data ecosystem (UNESCO,2020). Developing an effective EMIS is both complex and expensive, and during the process \"it is important to consider the needs of all the groups that will rely on the information, including central ministry planners, officials of other national ministries (for example, ministries of finance), regional and district education officials, donors, and NGOs\" (UNESCO-IIEP,2010, p. 156).As noted by Cassidy (2006), \"there is no universally-accepted definition of EMIS. The acronym, EMIS, means different things to different people\" (p. 2). Hence, Cassidy provides a somewhat wordy definition of EMIS, explaining the key inputs, functions, and outputs of an EMIS:\"An EMIS is a system for the collection, integration, processing, maintenance and dissemination of data and information to support decision making, policy-analysis and formulation, planning, monitoring, and management at all levels of an education system. It is a system of people, technology, models, methods, processes, procedures, rules and regulations that function together to provide education leaders, decision makers and managers at all levels with a comprehensive, integrated set of relevant, reliable, unambiguous, and timely data and information to support them in completion of their responsibilities.\" (Cassidy,2006, p."
"to provide education leaders, decision makers and managers at all levels with a comprehensive, integrated set of relevant, reliable, unambiguous, and timely data and information to support them in completion of their responsibilities.\" (Cassidy,2006, p. 27)Cassidy's (2006) definition has been widely adopted (e.g., Abdul-Hamid,2014; Bhatti & Adnan,2010; UNESCO,2007) and is the definition supporting our understanding of EMIS in this paper.Education data is key, as it can be used to monitor progress at individual schools, as well as the entire education system (Bhatti & Adnan,2010;Hua & Herstein,2003; Wako,2003). EMIS data is useful for allocation of education staff, school supply and other resources (Chapman,1991; Hua & Herstein,2003; Wako,2003), management strengthening (Chapman,1991), and policy planning and formulation (Hua & Herstein,2003; Wako,2003). Yet, despite these insights documented over the past decades, EMISs in many LMICs remain static and unresponsive, largely geared toward generation of statistics for historical analysis. Successes in establishing digitized EMISs that co-evolve with changing organizational priorities and decision maker needs are scarce. It is difficult to monitor progress toward national and global development goals (SDGs), when the EMIS backbone itself is unsustainable and systematic data use is lacking above the school level.In the following section we describe the recent uptake and development of affordance theory in IS research and suggest"
"development goals (SDGs), when the EMIS backbone itself is unsustainable and systematic data use is lacking above the school level.In the following section we describe the recent uptake and development of affordance theory in IS research and suggest a direction for its application in the analysis of IS strengthening efforts in the education sector and beyond.3 THEORY: AFFORDANCES IN ISThe affordance lens has gained traction in IS research (Fromm et al.,2020; Valbø,2021), serving as a useful tool to understand ICT-related organizational change. The notion of affordances was first introduced by Gibson (1977,1979) to the field of evolutionary psychology:\"Theaffordancesof the environment are what itoffersthe animal, what itprovidesorfurnishes, either for good or ill. The verb toaffordis found in the dictionary, but the nounaffordanceis not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.\" (Gibson,1979, p. 127)The concept was picked up in the HCI field (e.g., Gaver,1991; Norman,1988) and later found its way to the IS community. However, because the concept was adopted by IS (and HCI) researchers before it was fully developed in the original field (Fromm et al.,2020), there is a divergent use of the affordance lens among IS scholars (Leidner et al.,2018; Valbø,2021; Volkoff & Strong,2017).

"researchers before it was fully developed in the original field (Fromm et al.,2020), there is a divergent use of the affordance lens among IS scholars (Leidner et al.,2018; Valbø,2021; Volkoff & Strong,2017). A frequently used affordance definition is that of Volkoff and Strong (2013), being \"the potential for behaviors associated with achieving an immediate concrete outcome and arising from the relation between an object (e.g., an IT artifact) and a goal-oriented actor or actors'\" (p. 823). However, Du et al. (2019) dispute the need to includeimmediateandconcretein the definition, since \"it is difficult to separate concrete from non-concrete outcomes\" and \"not all affordances will have outcomes occurring instantly at the point in time of affordance actualization\" (p. 53). There are also psychology scholars who argue that \"Gibson's affordance theory still needs to be brought beyond 'the axiom of immediacy\" (Pedersen & Bang,2016, p. 731). While it makes sense in the HCI field to talk about immediate and concrete outcome of actions (e.g., clicking a button, scrolling with the mouse), limiting affordance outcomes to something \"immediate [and] concrete\" (Volkoff & Strong,2013, p. 823) makes little sense when studying organizational change. \"Organizations are complex and change is incremental and evolutionary\" (Keen,1981, p. 24). Hence, a study of how technology affects organizations and contributes to organizational change should be more concerned about longitudinal processes"
"change. \"Organizations are complex and change is incremental and evolutionary\" (Keen,1981, p. 24). Hence, a study of how technology affects organizations and contributes to organizational change should be more concerned about longitudinal processes and their effects rather than simple technology use actions with immediate observable outcomes. Although Leidner et al. (2018) go a long way in distancing themselves from Gibson's initial definition of an affordance, they raise a valid concern around how IS scholars have applied the affordance lens - namely that we should not be too concerned about the technology use itself, but rather what the technology use affords to the organization. It is in this debate we position our contribution, providing a theoretical framework nudging IS researchers toward studying affordances at an appropriate level of granularity suitable for the study of how technology use affects organizations. Thus, the affordance definition motivating this case study, is that of Volkoff and Strong but without the need for an immediate concrete outcome. Furthermore, affordances are not actualized in a vacuum (Volkoff & Strong,2017), but require facilitating conditions (Thapa & Sein,2018) in the context where they emerge (Bygstad et al.,2016; Strong et al.,2014). The actualization of affordances are supported by enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions (Bygstad et al.,2016). In Strong et al. (2014), some of the enabling conditions are the previously"
"they emerge (Bygstad et al.,2016; Strong et al.,2014). The actualization of affordances are supported by enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions (Bygstad et al.,2016). In Strong et al. (2014), some of the enabling conditions are the previously actualized lower-level affordances. In their affordance dependency diagram, they show how higher-level affordances depend on lower-level affordances. Their affordances are sequential in time and have stronger and weaker dependencies on lower-level affordances. In our analysis, we discovered similar dependencies. Using Bygstad et al. (2016) terminology, we refer to enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions when describing the multi-layered affordance dependencies we discovered.To avoid too much focus on mere technology-use, Volkoff and Strong (2017) recommend that IS researchers study affordances at an appropriate level granularity. Leidner et al. (2018) also subscribe to this idea, urging IS researchers to avoid focusing on lower-level technology-use affordances. Valbø and Sanner (2023) propose a nested affordance process model as a tool to nudge IS scholars toward the appropriate level of analysis in case studies using the affordance lens. In the present study we develop a framework for the identification of micro-, meso-, and macro-level affordances. First, micro-level affordances are technology-use affordances. That is, affordances that describe direct use of technology (e.g., data entering, data visualization)."
"develop a framework for the identification of micro-, meso-, and macro-level affordances. First, micro-level affordances are technology-use affordances. That is, affordances that describe direct use of technology (e.g., data entering, data visualization). Meso-level affordances are affordances that emerge as a result from the actualization of lower-level affordances and reside at the organizational level of abstraction. They are not direct technology-use but still tightly coupled to technology-use since they emerge as a consequence of technology-use. They can best be understood as related to the overall IT capabilities of an organization. Third, macro-level affordances are affordances that emerge as a result of the actualization of meso-level affordances. These might be hard to perceive and trace back to technology-use. However, they can be identified by looking at the outcomes of the actualizations of meso-level affordances and would typically constitute organization, organizational field or society level interventions and changes afforded by ICTs.Technology is not a panacea for development (Von Braun,2010, p. 12). Still, IT interventions can be seen \"everywhere\" in the development landscape, seeking to improve the lives of the marginalized and the poor (e.g., De', Pal et al.,2018). Faik et al. (2020) recently noted that there is limited attention to \"how [societal consequences] emerge from the development, deployment, or use of IT\" (p. 1361). They provide a rare analysis"
"of the marginalized and the poor (e.g., De', Pal et al.,2018). Faik et al. (2020) recently noted that there is limited attention to \"how [societal consequences] emerge from the development, deployment, or use of IT\" (p. 1361). They provide a rare analysis where they tie IT-use affordances to societal changes. Along the same vein, Essen and Värlander (2019) conclude that \"the introduction and evolution of a technological artifact in an institutional setting\" can contribute to changes at the field level (p. 1173). It is in response to these inspirational calls that we establish a framework for the identification of IS affordances and their interdependencies, at three levels of granularity in the discussion part of this paper. We recognize that associating affordances to micro, meso, and macro levels may be a point of contention in IS research. Our stance is that identifying affordances at these three levels of granularity allows us to reveal and question assumptions about the role of technology in shaping human endeavors while being mindful of the appropriate level of abstraction.4 METHOD4.1 Data collectionThe aim of this case study is to explore the layered IS affordances that emerge from users' interaction with ICT and the DHIS2-EMIS instance in the Gambia.

The first author conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with a total of 17 interviewees from several levels of the educational sector (Table1). Cluster monitors are employed at the district level and have an advisory role for a cluster of schools. Many of them have previously worked as teachers, and in their daily work they interact with several teachers. Interviewing cluster monitors was thus considered more effective than interviewing many teachers. The two teacher interviews that were conducted also did not reveal any new information that was not previously given by the cluster monitors. Three of the interviews were follow-up interviews. In total, more than 8 h of interviews were conducted, with an average duration of approximately 30 min. The interview guide was approved by the Norwegian center for research data (NSD), and the interviewees were informed about the research and their right to withdraw information at any time. An informed consent was given by all participants, and the quotes in this paper are published with explicit approval by all informants. The 19 interviews were transcribed verbatim to facilitate the coding process and identification of affordances.

The authors also attended the week-long academy for DHIS2 for education, which was organized in the country. The roundtable meetings and the participation in the academy served as good sources for a broader understanding of the Gambian educational sector. The second author has been involved in the long-term strengthening of the Gambian EMIS since January 2019. Through participation in strategic planning meetings, stakeholder mobilization meetings and capacity building initiatives, the second author has reviewed EMIS strategy documents, EMIS peer reviews, data policy briefs, school management manuals and software training materials as well as actual tools for education data collection, analysis, and presentation at all organizational levels.4.2 Data analysisThe transcribed notes were analyzed to identify affordances (i.e., action possibilities) emerging from the DHIS2-EMIS use in the educational sector in The Gambia. To identify these affordances, we followed an inductive coding process, similar to that of Treem and Leonardi (2012, p. 148). We identified 235 action possibilities, distributed between actions that were already realized as well as latent action possibilities perceived by the informants. We then sorted similar actions and action possibilities into first-order groups and then sorted the first-order groups into second-order groups. Finally, we abstracted the four"

We then sorted similar actions and action possibilities into first-order groups and then sorted the first-order groups into second-order groups. Finally, we abstracted the four overarching affordances from the second-order groups.Table2shows examples from our data set, illustrating the coding process. Similar to Majchrzak et al.'s (2013)metavoicingaffordance, the four remaining affordances can take many forms. For instance, our processability affordance can be in terms of availing data, interacting with data, analyzing data, or reporting data. Subsequently, the four affordances were coded according to granularity levels (micro, meso, macro) using the affordance identification framework we developed in this study.

"team with MoBSE was initially trained on DHIS2 customization and use by HISP West and Central Africa. Key outputs were locally relevant thematic dashboards and analysis tools in the software. One of the key strengths of DHIS2, is the HISP ecosystem - the increasing human capacity of the global HISP network. DHIS2 thus affords stakeholders in both the health and the educational domain in The Gambia the possibility of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and acting on timely data. The initial phases of the DHIS2-EMIS pilot in The Gambia involved using the individual student and registration component in DHIS2 at 200 schools.5.1 Aspirations of the Gambian education sectorMoBSE is determined to make progress toward SDG 4. These aspirations are embedded in national education policies and have been a key motivation for IT adoption not only for EMIS but in the area of education technology broadly, including piloting of educational apps in schools. This raises the questions: What can all this frequently generated digital education data be used for? How can it support decision-making and guide education sector planning and programmatic interventions? Whereas IT can be \"rolled out\" relatively quickly using a web-based server-client structure, the capacity to configure and use IT for something more than data collection takes time and is a prerequisite for the actualization of what we refer to as meso-level IS affordances.

"the capacity to configure and use IT for something more than data collection takes time and is a prerequisite for the actualization of what we refer to as meso-level IS affordances. In the following we zoom in on two key SDG 4 targets that MoBSE has highlighted in its recent education policies and that the education sector aspires to attain through data-driven decision-making with DHIS2 as an EMIS backbone, namely SDG targets 4.1 and 4.5. Historical failure to monitor progress across all SDG 4 targets has been a key grievance for MoBSE managers for years. Many countries on the African continent experience the same data struggle.5.2 SDG 4By measuring progress toward 10 targets, SDG 4 aims to \"ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\" (United Nations,n.d.). Each target can be monitored with reference to suggested indicators. In the following, we present the SDG targets 4.1 and 4.5.5.2.1 SDG 4.1 - Ensuring free, equitable, and quality educationThe aim of the SDG 4.1 target is to, \"by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes\" (United Nations,n.d.). The two suggested indicators to measure the attainment of this target, are the following:4.1.1 Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency"
"two suggested indicators to measure the attainment of this target, are the following:4.1.1 Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex4.1.2 Completion rate (primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education)The sustainable development goals and targets are just that - goals and targets. They do not provide any means or suggestions as to how to achieve those goals. The suggested indicators for measuring progress toward achieving the SDG 4 sub-targets may however indicate actions that need to be taken. For instance, in order to know the education completion rate (indicator 4.1.2), one would need to know the number of students completing the education as well as the population data for the corresponding age group. To do these calculations, an EMIS ICT officer at MoBSE explains that they have perceived the possibility of feeding the population data into DHIS2-EMIS in order to visualize the completion rate. The visualizations can be broken down to look at each school, or aggregated to district, regional and national level. A head teacher welcomes these plans, as in their school, they enroll many children that later drop out from the school. Without a proper tool to track the dropouts, it is hard to follow up.

"welcomes these plans, as in their school, they enroll many children that later drop out from the school. Without a proper tool to track the dropouts, it is hard to follow up. The head teacher explains.\"If [MoBSE] are able to track that [children] are not going to school, they should have informed us that child X with admission number X is no longer coming to school. ... So that, at least, at our level, we can do something, because, sometimes, we call parents and convince them, [and] they bring back their children to school.\" (Head teacher 1)5.2.2 SDG 4.5 - Eliminating gender disparities in educationThe aim of the SDG 4.5 target is to, \"by 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations\" (United Nations,n.d.). The suggested indicator to measure the attainment of this target, is the following:4.5.1 Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile, and others, such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregatedData for the calculation of gender parity indicators is currently collected through the DHIS2-EMIS instance.

"for the calculation of gender parity indicators is currently collected through the DHIS2-EMIS instance. As one of the EMIS ICT officers said, \"you can just go in the system and have the enrolment of the gender at school\". Additionally, the possibilities of using DHIS2-EMIS captured data to overcome other disparities were also perceived. A regional director gives a hypothetical example for a disabled boy: \"If the variables that are related to equity and equality are there, obviously, when you do your analysis ... you [will] know... what can we do, so that he has equal opportunities like everybody\".6 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: DHIS2-EMIS AFFORDANCESWe identify four distinct overarching affordances for DHIS2-EMIS affecting Gambian educational stakeholders in their quest for attaining the SDG 4: configurability, data registration, processability, and actionability. This section proceeds as follows. First, we define the four DHIS2-EMIS affordances and their corresponding levels of granularity. Second, we highlight the enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions for the affordances and explain how affordances can serve both as enabling and stimulating conditions for other affordances, causing affordance loops to emerge. Lastly, we conclude this section by emphasizing the role of meso-level affordances in the attainment of higher-level aspirations, such as the attainment of SDG 4 in the education sector in The Gambia.6.1 Micro-, meso- and macro-level affordancesStrong et al."
"we conclude this section by emphasizing the role of meso-level affordances in the attainment of higher-level aspirations, such as the attainment of SDG 4 in the education sector in The Gambia.6.1 Micro-, meso- and macro-level affordancesStrong et al. (2014) explain how the actualization ofbasic affordances(individual-level technology-use affordances) cause the emergence ofmore-advanced affordances. However, Leidner et al. (2018) suggest to use the termsfirst-orderandsecond-orderto indicate the order of actualization as well as to refrain from conveying the impression that basic affordances are easier to actualize than more-advanced affordances. Generally, IS scholars thus divide affordances into two layers, namely lower-level affordances and higher-level affordances. Lower-level (basic; first-order) affordances are often related to technology use, while higher-level (more-advanced; second-order) affordances just indicate affordances that emerge at a later stage and may or may not pertain to the organizational level. We therefore choose to use the terms micro, meso, and macro to help convey the societal level to which they pertain as well as the order of actualization.Detailed descriptions of the affordances are given in Table4. In the following, we explain how the multi-layered affordances depend on and influence each other through affordance loops.TABLE  4.DHIS2-EMIS affordances.AffordancesExplanationsCase examplesaMicro-level affordances(basic technology"

As such, the context in which DHIS2-EMIS is embedded, is complex, with a broad variation in stakeholders and operational sites, ranging from teachers in rural schools to ministry employees in the capital. In Table5, we present the overarching DHIS2-EMIS affordances, the actors, the enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions, and the outcome of the affordances. We observe that for micro- and meso-level affordances, the outcome is both immediate and concrete, coherent with Volkoff and Strong's (2013) affordance definition.

"micro- and meso-level affordances, the outcome is both immediate and concrete, coherent with Volkoff and Strong's (2013) affordance definition. However, considering the macro-level affordanceactionability, the outcome is neither immediate nor concrete, which undergirds the challenge of explicitly linking IT adoption and use to concrete development outcomes, such as actions that inform progress toward the SDG 4 targets.TABLE  5.DHIS2-EMIS Affordances; enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions; and affordance actualization outcomes.AffordancesActorsEnabling (E), stimulating (S), and releasing (R) conditionsCase outcome examplesConfigurabilityEMISastaff and HISP implementers (with EMIS knowledge and technical capacity)E: Access to HISP network capacityS: ActionabilityR: HISP West and Central Africa supportDHIS2 prepared for data registration, reporting and analysisSame data definitions across the entire sectorA uniform dashboard for attendanceCapturability(Trained) school staffE: ConfigurabilityS: Desire to see own dataR: Instructions from MoBSEEnrolled studentsStatistical dataProcessabilityEducation stakeholders at all levels (with EMIS knowledge and skills to interpret data)E: CapturabilityS: ActionabilityR: Desire to understand developmentReportsAnnual yearbooksKnow if a catchment area needs developmentActionabilityEducation stakeholders at all levelsE: ProcessabilityS: SDG attainabilityR: Desire to improveIntervention plansImproved educationEquitable access to"

(2014) explain how the immediate concrete outcome of the actualization of an affordance provide feedback for adjusting the actions and the elements that give rise to the affordance (p. 70), while Bygstad et al. (2016) found that generative mechanisms could serve as stimulating conditions for affordances (p. 94). In our case, the findings suggest that future (not yet actualized) affordances may serve as stimulating conditions, even without having provided any outcome yet. The perception of a possible outcome of a future affordance was enough to stimulate the actualization of current affordances. For instance, actors' perceptions about the possible actionability affordance were found to stimulate the initiation of the DHIS2-EMIS implementation and thus motivate the actualization of the configurability affordance:\"The goal is to get something that ... eventually like Facebook.Everybodyuses it, whenever they want. Nobody controls it. So data is just used.\" (The EMIS head)Similarly, the actionability affordance also motivated the actualization of the capturability affordance:\"Possible, if we can get [the reported information] very early, maybe in a shorter period, it is"
"controls it. So data is just used.\" (The EMIS head)Similarly, the actionability affordance also motivated the actualization of the capturability affordance:\"Possible, if we can get [the reported information] very early, maybe in a shorter period, it is fine. Like, where you need to adjust yourself, you can know it very quickly. And then you act on that.\" (Head teacher 2)At a later stage, the actionability affordance was also perceived to motivate the actualization of the processability affordance:\"If the system is such that it's very effective and people that are working on it have the capacity to do so. I'm pretty sure that it will bring a lot of benefits to the sector ... [and] help in our processes, not only decision making, but even action taking. It can do a world!\" (A regional director)Affordances are not actualized in a vacuum (Volkoff & Strong,2017) but in an organizational context. A vital part of an organizational context is knowledge production and knowledge sharing. For a future affordance to serve as a stimulating condition for a preceding affordance, actors must have the capability and knowledge needed to perceive the future affordance. While training stakeholders inhowto use DHIS2-EMIS is important, our findings also stress the importance of teaching the stakeholderswhythey should use DHIS2-EMIS.

"findings also stress the importance of teaching the stakeholderswhythey should use DHIS2-EMIS. Understanding the potential consequences of their technology use may motivate them to use it as instructed by MoBSE. In other words: perceiving future meso- and macro-level affordances serve as stimulating conditions for the actualization of micro-level affordances. In Figure1, we demonstrate this interplay between micro-, meso- and macro-level affordances, as we illustrate how the DHIS2-EMIS affordances enable the emergence of subsequent affordances while the affordances also feed back by stimulating the actualization of the preceding affordances. It is this interplay between the multi-layered affordances we refer to as affordance loops.FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointAffordance loops: The DHIS2-EMIS affordances and their interdependency in terms of enabling and stimulating conditions.Some might argue that the introduction of granularity levels and macro-level affordances without any immediate and concrete outcome is watering out the original idea of affordances. It is arguably quite some distance and difference between a basic cutting affordance (Gibson,1977) and a higher-level actionability affordance (paper 4). But nevertheless, in an IS setting, affordances are what the technology \"providesorfurnishes\" (Gibson,1979, p. 127). And just like the knife provides a chef the possibility of cutting a cucumber, DHIS2-EMIS furnish the Gambian stakeholders with the knowledge they"
"in an IS setting, affordances are what the technology \"providesorfurnishes\" (Gibson,1979, p. 127). And just like the knife provides a chef the possibility of cutting a cucumber, DHIS2-EMIS furnish the Gambian stakeholders with the knowledge they need to take actions. Hence, the actionability affordance does indeed \"[imply] the complementarity of\" (Gibson,1979, p. 127) the Gambian stakeholders and DHIS2-EMIS. Thus, we contend that higher-level action possibilities that emerge as a result of the actualization of micro- and meso-level affordances involving a specific technology should indeed be considered affordances of that technology, even though the macro-level affordances themselves do not involve direct use of the technology. As long as they are provided or furnished by (the interaction between) the technology (and its users), they are indeed affordances of that technology.The meso-level processability affordance plays a key role in the Gambian DHIS2-EMIS, stimulating the preceding capturability affordance and enabling the subsequent actionability affordance. We discuss the role of the meso-level affordances in the following sub-section.6.3 Enacting sustainable development through meso-level affordancesThe informants that are currently using DHIS2-EMIS, have all received training in how to use the technology. That is, they have learned how to enter and avail data (e.g., through visualizing data with dashboards). But available data alone is not sufficient to inform action."
"are currently using DHIS2-EMIS, have all received training in how to use the technology. That is, they have learned how to enter and avail data (e.g., through visualizing data with dashboards). But available data alone is not sufficient to inform action. Data must be timely, of good quality, it must be interpreted correctly, and it must be presented in an understandable way to someone with the mandate and organizational flexibility to act. Qualified personnel must take decisions and assign the appropriate resources to see the necessary actions through. In other words, in order to use data to enact significant changes, it takes more than knowing how to use certain technology features. Considerable emphasis needs to be placed on the meso-level processability affordance in order to ensure significant utilization of education data in decision-making and subsequently acting on it. Drawing on close to 30 years of experience from \"information for action\" (Walsham,2020), the HISP network assist with relevant capacity-building in the Gambian DHIS2-EMIS case.Extensive capacity-building at the national and subnational level is necessary in an education sector that has historically relied on yearly census and survey data and is now shifting toward digital individual learner and teacher records. In the education sector in LMICs, novel ICTs are expected to contribute to a wealth of data that can inform interventions and facilitate progress toward SDG 4 attainment. Yet, few education data"
"toward digital individual learner and teacher records. In the education sector in LMICs, novel ICTs are expected to contribute to a wealth of data that can inform interventions and facilitate progress toward SDG 4 attainment. Yet, few education data strategy and policy documents outline how organizational capacity to actualize these affordances will be harnessed. In particular, our study highlights the need for policy formulation that explicates the link between technology adoption and use and higher-level development goals and targets. Identification and scrutiny of meso-level IS affordances and how to realize them to pave the way for development outcomes is critical, and, as our empirical study indicates, should start by identifying the roles, resources, capacities, and facilitating conditions that enable and motivate the actualization of data processing and data use affordances at the sub-national level in LMICs.7 CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we have introduced and applied the affordance identification framework (AIF). The identified DHIS2-EMIS affordances were categorized using the framework and abstracted to four overarching DHIS2-EMIS affordances: configurability, capturability, processability, and actionability.

"shows how the four multi-layered DHIS2-EMIS affordances are interrelated through affordance loops and emphasizes the importance of the meso-level IS affordances. The meso-level processability affordance plays a vital role in the quest for attaining the SDG 4, since it connects micro-level technology-use affordances with macro-level affordances with societal-level impact. IT is not a panacea for development, and the actualization of the processability affordance requires the preceding actualization of a complex series of micro-level affordances along with enabling, stimulating, and releasing conditions, including sufficient human capacity to both configure data systems, structure, and analyze data in meaningful ways and prepare data for utilization in decision-making processes. Too often information systems strengthening initiatives in LMICs are seen as IT projects, with too much emphasis put on the affordances associated with direct and immediate technology use (micro-level affordances), while the realization of intended outcomes, such as SDG 4 attainment is assumed to flow from technology use. We would argue that an affordance perspective on IS strengthening can help identify and question technology determinisms and highlight the intricate interdependencies, including affordance loops, between the actualization of different micro-, meso- and macro-level affordances.CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTThe authors declare no conflicts of interestAPPENDIX A: THE NESTED AFFORDANCE"

(2014), Burton-Jones and Volkoff (2017), and Thapa and Sein (2018):[FigureA1] attempts to convey that an affordance can consist of an ensemble of sub-affordances (i.e., \"nested in space\" [Gaver,1991]; cluster/ensemble of affordances [Thapa & Sein,2018]) and as such, that there is not a one-to-one relation between the actualization of an affordance and the following emergence of an affordance at a higher level of granularity (Burton-Jones & Volkoff,2017; Strong et al.,2014). ... The trajectory along which an affordance travels (Thapa & Sein,2018) is illustrated with the arrows, and the facilitating conditions serving as prerequisites for the emergence of the affordances are illustrated with the dotted arrows.

"AbstractInternational wildlife trade data are frequently used by government agencies, conservation organizations, and scientific researchers to study and protect species from overexploitation and prevent the spread of invasive species and introduction of zoonotic pathogens. Inaccurate data can lead to mistaken conclusions by researchers, the development of unsuccessful remedial conservation actions, and provide government officials with incorrect views of detrimental trade. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) maintains the world's most comprehensive national dataset of legal and illegal international wildlife trade recorded by individual shipments and species in its Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). Although the importance of LEMIS data is not to be understated, the errors and inconsistencies contained therein have not previously been adequately recognized or studied. Based on firsthand experiences with the creation and application of LEMIS data, this manuscript describes a variety of errors, biases, omissions, and an overall lack of data quality assurance. An independent audit of the LEMIS wildlife trade database and the service's policies, procedures, and protocols for managing this system is needed. Additional recommendations are also offered to develop better management standards and bring greater resources for managing LEMIS, asking the nongovernmental organization and intergovernmental organization user communities to play a role.1"
"is needed. Additional recommendations are also offered to develop better management standards and bring greater resources for managing LEMIS, asking the nongovernmental organization and intergovernmental organization user communities to play a role.1 INTRODUCTIONThe global wildlife trade affects thousands of species and millions of animals annually. Uses of wildlife include traditional and emerging sources of food, pets, medicine, clothing, scientific and biomedical research, and other purposes (The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora [CITES] Secretariat,2022; Eskew et al.,2020; Fitzgerald,1989; Hughes,2021; Rosen & Smith,2010). It is important to continually monitor international wildlife trade to detect and prevent overexploitation of wild populations and scan for activities associated with the introduction of invasive species (Lo Parrino et al.,2021; Nijman et al.,2022; Smith et al.,2009). Increasingly, the monitoring of wildlife trade is considered necessary to better understand the emergence of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19 (Green et al.,2020; Hilderink & de Winter,2021; Karesh et al.,2005; Smith et al.,2017). To develop effective surveillance and regulatory systems that employ scientific rigor to these goals, information describing both legal and illegal wildlife trade must be accurately recorded and available to researchers (Natusch et al.,2021).2 RECORDING OF WILDLIFE TRADE DATA BY THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE"
"that employ scientific rigor to these goals, information describing both legal and illegal wildlife trade must be accurately recorded and available to researchers (Natusch et al.,2021).2 RECORDING OF WILDLIFE TRADE DATA BY THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICEFor international wildlife trade involving the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) collects a wealth of data each time wildlife is imported or (re-)exported; including species both listed and not listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). As of February 2022, the USFWS uses 26,642 4-letter codes to record trade in different species (USFWS, pers. comm. to B. Weissgold; Feb. 2022). These species-specific wildlife trade data are held in an electronic database maintained by USFWS called the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). A variety of data points are recorded in LEMIS, such as the scientific name, quantity of specimens, country of origin, whether the specimen(s) was bred in captivity or sourced from the wild, and more. Most wildlife trade records are entered in LEMIS remotely by commercial freight brokerage companies when filing import/export declarations, with the remainder (paper declarations) entered by USFWS Wildlife Inspectors (USFWS, pers. comm. to B. Weissgold; July 2023). To the best of the author's knowledge, the relative accuracy of data entered by commercial brokers compared with data entered by WIs has not been"
"(paper declarations) entered by USFWS Wildlife Inspectors (USFWS, pers. comm. to B. Weissgold; July 2023). To the best of the author's knowledge, the relative accuracy of data entered by commercial brokers compared with data entered by WIs has not been investigated by USFWS.LEMIS was not originally designed to be solely a trade database; it was instead a DOS-based (Disk Operating System) investigation case management tool for the USFWS's Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) to maintain records of wildlife moving into and out of the United States for law enforcement-related operational goals. The OLE's priority is determining legal versus illegal trade and intercepting unlawful trade, whereas ensuring the accuracy of trade data recorded in LEMIS is a lower priority. As such, LEMIS records have become riddled with errors and inaccuracies as OLE does not apply systematic quality control measures to prevent, identify, or correct false or unsubstantiated data entered by people.The information described herein draws from firsthand experiences with the creation and application of LEMIS data by USFWS. LEMIS data may be provided to the public following a U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. However, the data provided (even under identical requests) may vary due to administrative, legal, and human factors, making accurate and reproducible analyses extremely difficult. In 2022 (date unknown), without any announcement, OLE posted \"import-export [sic]\" data on a public website"
"under identical requests) may vary due to administrative, legal, and human factors, making accurate and reproducible analyses extremely difficult. In 2022 (date unknown), without any announcement, OLE posted \"import-export [sic]\" data on a public website (https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/office-law-enforcement-importexport-data). Unfortunately, the agency has not provided information on the content of the data posted, why it was posted, and what is included or excluded. During the time the data was posted, USFWS was embroiled in several lawsuits by nongovernmental organizations seeking greater data access. One litigant nongovernmental organization (NGO) believes the data posting was \"loosely related\" to one or more of the legal cases (Center for Biological Diversity, pers. comm. to B. Weissgold; Sept. 2023).Measuring the scale of errors and biases among the millions of wildlife trade records maintained in LEMIS requires significant resources beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nevertheless, it is important for researchers, regulators, and advocates to better understand and acknowledge the specific limitations of LEMIS data, particularly when publishing scientific articles, considering CITES wildlife trade regulatory measures, or making policy or legal recommendations.3 MISINTERPRETATION OF LEMIS DATA MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT CONSERVATION POLICIESMany academic studies strive to evaluate the conservation impact of international trade on wild species and frequently rely"
"measures, or making policy or legal recommendations.3 MISINTERPRETATION OF LEMIS DATA MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT CONSERVATION POLICIESMany academic studies strive to evaluate the conservation impact of international trade on wild species and frequently rely heavily on LEMIS data. These analyses are often translated into policy recommendations for governments and the wider conservation community to strengthen or loosen species-specific trade regulations. Strong caveats about the completeness and accuracy of the data used are often not included by authors.The LEMIS system has multiple components (administrative, investigative, intelligence-related, licensure, import-export data, etc.], only two of which contain wildlife trade data. The import-export database contains records ofinternationaltrade (legal and illegal) taking place at ports of entry or other border crossings. LEMIS's investigative subsystem contains additional data generated duringdomesticlaw enforcement investigations. It is important to note that wildlife confiscated in domestic federal law enforcement operations, even if the wildlife was intended for export or the result of prior illegal importation, is normally not included in LEMIS's import-export database because the confiscations often do not occur at ports of entry. Most researchers are not aware of the additional data generated during domestic law enforcement operations.The exclusion of domestic confiscation data from LEMIS FOIA responses can undermine"
"because the confiscations often do not occur at ports of entry. Most researchers are not aware of the additional data generated during domestic law enforcement operations.The exclusion of domestic confiscation data from LEMIS FOIA responses can undermine understanding of the scope of wildlife trafficking in the United States and globally. This occurred, for example, with a 2017-2019 investigation of illegal trade in Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) (U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ],2018). When USFWS executed a search warrant at the trafficker's residence in 2017, they confiscated over 3400 live terrapins intended for domestic and international trade. However, an examination of LEMIS data by the author spanning 2015-2019 found no (N= 0) records of the confiscation of any live Diamondback terrapins by USFWS, ostensibly because the data were collected during a domestic law enforcement operation, not during international import or export. Researchers requesting and using only import-export data from LEMIS to study illegal trade of the species in the United States could wrongly conclude that none exists, whereas this is hardly the case. In the last decade, thousands of native freshwater and terrestrial turtles have been confiscated domestically by USFWS, but few of these populate the LEMIS trade database. USFWS domestic confiscations of animals intended for international trade are rarely tabulated and, thus, are unknown to the research community.4 LEMIS DATA ARE NOT"

USFWS domestic confiscations of animals intended for international trade are rarely tabulated and, thus, are unknown to the research community.4 LEMIS DATA ARE NOT STANDARDIZEDThe academic community, conservation organizations, foreign governments, and intergovernmental organizations often rely on LEMIS data as if it were collected in a standardized scientific manner. Unfortunately, the magnitude of errors among these records has never been measured in a standardized manner, principally because OLE does not have procedures in place to check their accuracy. Unresolved data quality issues are so abundant within LEMIS that its utility for conservation and social science research is impinged.The version of LEMIS trade data submitted by USFWS to the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) as part of the US' CITES Annual Report (and incorporated into the online CITES trade database;https://trade.cites.org/) is populated by fewer errors (but presumably an equal number of omissions) than the version of LEMIS data provided to the public by OLE through FOIA requests. This is because the CITES Annual Report trade data drawn from LEMIS are first \"cleaned\" by the USFWS's Division of Management Authority (DMA; the US-designated CITES Management Authority) prior to its submission to UNEP-WCMC and subsequent entry into the CITES trade database.

"data drawn from LEMIS are first \"cleaned\" by the USFWS's Division of Management Authority (DMA; the US-designated CITES Management Authority) prior to its submission to UNEP-WCMC and subsequent entry into the CITES trade database. In its preparation of the annual report, the DMA will remove some data that are obviously recorded in error (i.e., records coded as live humpback whale wallets) and whenever possible, either through a series of logic checks or by examining original shipment documentation, will make necessary corrections to these data. Although the DMA provides these errors to OLE, it is not clear what the OLE does with this information, in part because some of these errors remain uncorrected and continue to populate the database.It is important to note that DMA does not remove or edit all erroneous LEMIS data. Many common human errors fall beyond the capacity of the additional quality checks DMA conducts, so even some of the \"clean\" LEMIS data in the CITES trade database still includes errors. Mistyped numbers or incorrect selections of codes from drop-down menus can wildly affect data accuracy. Species imported may falsely increase by a factor of ten or more when blood samples are coded as live animals, or when multiple identical declarations are erroneously entered into LEMIS (pers. ob. B. Weissgold) because fixing an incorrect declaration takes more time than creating a new one (pers. comm. J. Kolby). Lawful US imports of common ark clam shells (Anadarasp. ="
"multiple identical declarations are erroneously entered into LEMIS (pers. ob. B. Weissgold) because fixing an incorrect declaration takes more time than creating a new one (pers. comm. J. Kolby). Lawful US imports of common ark clam shells (Anadarasp. = USFWS species code \"AND?\") can be incorrectly coded as illegal imports of endangered Japanese salamanders (Andrias davidianus= USFWS species code \"ANDA\") simply because a pair of letters in codes were incorrectly entered into LEMIS (pers. comm. J. Kolby). Most errors result simply from humans incorrectly typing species and other codes and numbers during data entry. The most common errors, based on the author's observations, include misidentifying: the taxa traded (e.g., recording endangered salamanders when they were instead clams); the number of specimens involved (e.g., two (2) male and three (3) female Green tree monitor lizards [Varanus prasinus] recorded as 23 Komodo monitors [Varanus komodoensis]); the source of specimens (wild collected vs. bred in captivity); the origin of specimens (e.g., elephant ivory recorded as harvested on the high seas); the type of transaction (import, export, or reexport); and the type of specimen in trade (e.g., snake \"feet\" that were instead snakeskin boots) (pers. obs. B. Weissgold; pers. comm. J. Kolby). These errors, which are of unknown frequency, may affect data attributes fundamental to monitoring and assessing wildlife trade.Additionally, LEMIS records are not static data points,"
"snakeskin boots) (pers. obs. B. Weissgold; pers. comm. J. Kolby). These errors, which are of unknown frequency, may affect data attributes fundamental to monitoring and assessing wildlife trade.Additionally, LEMIS records are not static data points, although they are often interpreted as such by researchers. OLE can change data at any time when edits are deemed necessary, and records of such changes are not maintained. Therefore, FOIA requests submitted at different times with identical data parameters can be fulfilled with nonidentical datasets. Such variations in wildlife trade records across time likely contribute toward some of the data use and interpretation challenges discussed by Challender et al. (2021), especially when data from both LEMIS and the CITES trade database are compared or combined.5 CERTAIN LEMIS DATA MISREPRESENT ACTUAL WILDLIFE TRADEEskew et al. (2020) made a considerable effort to identify some of the more obvious types of LEMIS data errors, but the extent of errors and inconsistencies is more deeply ingrained and scientifically detrimental than previously expressed. LEMIS data describing the same wildlife trade events can be coded differently by customs brokers, and data review practices by wildlife inspectors vary between offices and even differ on a case-by-case basis, due to the observations and/or predilections of the person coding or entering the data (J. Kolby, pers. comm.). The perception that LEMIS data are inherently objective and"
"wildlife inspectors vary between offices and even differ on a case-by-case basis, due to the observations and/or predilections of the person coding or entering the data (J. Kolby, pers. comm.). The perception that LEMIS data are inherently objective and accurate--and provide a reliable representation of wildlife trade--is often perpetuated by researchers who have published results from LEMIS data: Assertions such that LEMIS involves \"consistent standards\" (Hughes et al.,2021) and that \"systems like LEMIS should become global standards\" (Marshall et al.,2020) often do not acknowledge the absence of quality control and standardization and error rates. LEMIS data inaccuracies significantly undermine scientific integrity and undoubtedly can mislead researchers and conservation professional when explicitly interpreted.LEMIS data errors and inconsistencies are particularly prevalent when documentation is partly or entirely missing at the time of import or (re)export. Data for these shipments have been created and entered directly into LEMIS by wildlife inspectors (and previously contractors), and there is an absence of quality assurance measures to prevent the entry of erroneous data. An examination of the trade in crocodilians based on LEMIS included, for example, the importation of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) harvested on the high seas, where this species cannot be found, and the importation of crocodilian material described as wild-caught in European"
"based on LEMIS included, for example, the importation of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) harvested on the high seas, where this species cannot be found, and the importation of crocodilian material described as wild-caught in European countries where they do not live in the wild and most likely originated in other countries (J. Kolby, pers. comm).Another frequently imperceptible source of error occurs when the OLE enters information into LEMIS that cannot be substantiated, such as the source[s] of illegally traded wildlife. For example, OLE often confiscates non-declared imports of traditional Chinese medicine. Frequently, the product packaging indicates that it contains prohibited wildlife, for example, tiger or leopard bone and rhinoceros or saiga antelope horn. Although these shipments can be confiscated under US law, the packaging rarely indicates the source of the wildlife ingredient. Big cat bone is often listed as an ingredient, without indicating whether the animal was wild-sourced or captive-bred, assuming the product even contained any genuine bone material at all, let alone bone from tiger, leopard, jaguar, and so on. Medicinal manufacturers may also lure consumers and speculatively can charge higher prices, by claiming the presence of expensive animal (or plant) ingredients in their products, when none are present. Under this common scenario, OLE frequently records the source for the wildlife in such a packaged product as \"wild,\" when the true"
"higher prices, by claiming the presence of expensive animal (or plant) ingredients in their products, when none are present. Under this common scenario, OLE frequently records the source for the wildlife in such a packaged product as \"wild,\" when the true source was unknown and may have alternatively been a captive breeding operation. A source code for \"unknown\" is available in LEMIS and is most scientifically appropriate to record in these instances, but the absence of quality assurance, and the predilections of individuals, allows the \"wild\" source code to be entered instead. Consequently, LEMIS data are populated with information that should not be treated as accurate as evidence was not used to substantiate entries (Kolby & Weissgold,2022).6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSSome wildlife trade data errors, omissions, and inconsistencies can be identified by highly experienced LEMIS users, but many are virtually indistinguishable from accurate trade data. When the USFWS withholds data and key documents are not released by USFWS to retrospectively validate such data, it becomes impossible to isolate and correct some of these errors and measure data accuracy. Limitations such as these should be disclosed in a clear and detailed explanatory manner in all studies that use LEMIS data. The importance of LEMIS data is not to be understated, but greater care must be exercised in how these data are presented to prevent misinterpretation, miscommunication, and consequently, misguided"
"explanatory manner in all studies that use LEMIS data. The importance of LEMIS data is not to be understated, but greater care must be exercised in how these data are presented to prevent misinterpretation, miscommunication, and consequently, misguided wildlife conservation recommendations and policies.Despite all the shortcomings of the LEMIS data, the problems afflicting this system could be significantly improved if adequate financial and staff resources were directed toward the recording and verification of data entered. The creation, implementation, and enforcement of standardized USFWS data recording policies would further lessen the multitude of LEMIS challenges identified herein which reduce the scientific value and utility of these data.Therefore, specifically, I recommend the following actions that should lead to the improvement of LEMIS data quality and accuracy:The Department of the Interior's Office of Inspector General should conduct a top-to-bottom audit of the LEMIS database, policies, procedures, and protocols for managing the system, entering and validating data, and correcting it when inaccuracies are identified. Such a review should also make recommendations to the USFWS and Congress for improvements and consider the additional resources necessary to optimize the performance and accuracy of the LEMIS database.The USFWS OLE should review and correct erroneous LEMIS data when informed of such by the Service's Division of Management Authority.Consistent with"
"consider the additional resources necessary to optimize the performance and accuracy of the LEMIS database.The USFWS OLE should review and correct erroneous LEMIS data when informed of such by the Service's Division of Management Authority.Consistent with applicable law, USFWS should make all LEMIS import-export data publicly available in real-time on the Service's website and provide a detailed public explanation of how the data is collected, recorded, validated, and corrected. USFWS should also tabulate and inform the public of other wildlife confiscation data it collects, which is not contained in the import-export database.The specialized user community of LEMIS import-export data--principally NGO and intergovernmental organizations and federal government agencies--are sometimes aware of the system's shortcomings. However, they have engaged in virtually no efforts to improve and correct these data. As such, those groups, particularly NGOs which have regular contact with the US Congress' appropriation processes, should assist USFWS in improving the management and administration of LEMIS to better ensure the accuracy of the data through the establishment of quality control measures and greater transparency measures and public access.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThanks to Jonathan Kolby for sharing firsthand experiences with the creation and analysis of LEMIS data based on his service with the USFWS.

"AbstractStudies evaluating students' UX of applications that will influence their continuance use of educational systems in Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) have not been sufficiently addressed in the African region, specifically in Ghana. Thus, conducting a study on students' UX of systems in HEIs will enhance students' interest in continuing to use such systems. Therefore, this study examines students' user experience (UX) and how it impacts their continued use of the Student Management Information System (SMIS). The study proposed a research model by integrating user experience questionnaire (UEQ) constructs with continuance intention to use. The study adopted an online questionnaire to collect data from 415 students at Koforidua Technical University (KTU). The partial least square-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) method was used to evaluate the proposed model's reliability, validity, and relationship among the constructs. The UEQ data analysis tool was used in analysing the data. The study's findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, stimulation, and novelty significantly influenced students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. However, dependability did not significantly affect students' continuance intention to use the SMIS.

Also, the study's findings on the benchmark results showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, and stimulation were categorized as good, while dependability, efficiency, and novelty were categorized as excellent. These findings offer valuable insights for UX designers and developers aiming to create engaging and intuitive SMIS solutions. Also, it will provide students feedback on system UX that can be incorporated into future release updates. Furthermore, this research contributes significantly to the understanding of student UX with SMIS in developing country HEIs and its impact on continued usage.1. IntroductionTechnology plays a vital role in the digitalization of models and processes in the educational sector. Institutions leverage technology to manage administrative procedures and integrate it as a tool to assist in teaching and learning activities. Computerised systems provide value to HEIs by generating meaningful, reliable, timely, and accessible information [1]. These systems collect data on students and staff. The data are analysed to generate reports that help make strategic decisions regarding students, courses, programmes, departments, and staff. Accreditation and other regulatory bodies use the statistical data to monitor the activities and assess the effectiveness of HEIs. Students use their management information systems to register their courses and hostels online and check the course timetables and exam schedules. They"
"bodies use the statistical data to monitor the activities and assess the effectiveness of HEIs. Students use their management information systems to register their courses and hostels online and check the course timetables and exam schedules. They also use the systems to access their results and transcripts. SMIS helps to efficiently manage students' personal information and academic details and optimize the institution's management processes to enhance productivity [2-5].When users interact with websites, software systems, applications, and products, an experience is created based on the user's feelings [6]. The development of user applications has shifted from centering around technology to focusing on user-centricity. Developers engage in UX research to improve the UX of applications. The user experience may vary based on the type of application and the platform/device running the app. Developers and system analysts utilise some techniques to develop apps to meet the users' needs, personas, empathy maps, wireframes, and prototypes [6]. A UX evaluation is necessary to measure the application's usability and user satisfaction. Feedback from the evaluation is used to improve the application's effectiveness and efficiency and enhance the user's experience [7-9]. UX design activities should be incorporated into the development process and even after completion.Continuous exploration of user needs will help to continually improve the user experience.

"and enhance the user's experience [7-9]. UX design activities should be incorporated into the development process and even after completion.Continuous exploration of user needs will help to continually improve the user experience. A poorly designed SMIS interface becomes a source of frustration, and the student discontinues using the application. An application that matches the student's experience maintains the interest to continue using the app to derive value and enhance their productivity [10]. Similarly, the UX of applications significantly impacts the intention and continuance use of the application. Mirmehdi [11] developed a structural model to analyse and test the dimensions among users of branded apps. The research also investigated the dimensions of the user experience of branded apps and their effects on the continuance intention of use.Research has been conducted widely in several countries to evaluate the UX of applications. Some of these countries include Germany [12,13], Indonesia [14-17], Kuwait [10], Saudi Arabia, and Jordan [9]. However, studies evaluating UX of applications have not been sufficiently addressed in the African region, specifically in Ghana. Also, few studies have been conducted on using UX to examine the students' continuance use of a system. Thus, conducting a study on students' UX of SMIS in HEIs such as technical universities will enhance students' interest in continuing to use the SMIS.

Thus, conducting a study on students' UX of SMIS in HEIs such as technical universities will enhance students' interest in continuing to use the SMIS. Also, it will provide students feedback on SMIS UX that can be incorporated into future release updates of the SMIS. In addition, it will provide management of HEIs with valuable insights on key UX characteristics that need to be considered when investing in SMIS. Therefore, this study sought to investigate students' experience of using the SMIS, an SMIS deployed at KTU. In addition, a research model based on UX characteristics is proposed to test how UX characteristics significantly impact students' intention to continue using the SMIS.The rest of the article is organized as follows.

[17] to investigate the UX of multimedia for professional teacher education.

"teacher education. The result from the study showed that attractiveness, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty were rated as excellent. In contrast, the scale of perspicuity was rated above average according to the interval benchmark of UEQ. In addition, all scores are above 0.8, which shows that the evaluation of UX is positive.In another study by Laksono et al. [18], they evaluated students' UX by using a UEQ scale and a sharable content object reference model, that is, a learning management system (LMS). Their findings from the UEQ scale showed that attractiveness, dependability, stimulation, and novelty were rated as bad, whereas perspicuity and efficiency were rated below average. Similarly, the results showed that interaction and content were rated as bad, whereas management was rated as below average. Their findings showed that students had poor UX. Also, Ali and Ramlie [19] conducted a study on students' UX of learning with a hologram tutor. Their results showed that attractiveness, efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, stimulation, and novelty obtained positive mean scores. Thus, their findings showed that students' learning experience with a hologram tutor was promising and positive. Similarly, AlGothami and Saeed [20] evaluated the UX of end-users of the COVID-19 mobile application. Their findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty obtained positive mean scores above 0.80. Thus, end-users"
"and Saeed [20] evaluated the UX of end-users of the COVID-19 mobile application. Their findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty obtained positive mean scores above 0.80. Thus, end-users were generally satisfied with their UX, while using the mobile application.Bayu and Setiawan [14] suggested that attractiveness, efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, stimulation, and novelty significantly influenced users' experience on the enterprise resource planning. In addition, their findings also showed that dependability, stimulation, and novelty were rated in the excellent category, while perspicuity, attractiveness, and efficiency were rated in the good category. In general, the enterprise resource planning met users' expectations. Martin and Mauritsius [21] conducted a study on UX on an e-commerce application in Indonesia. Their results showed that attractiveness, dependability, stimulation, novelty, and task success significantly influence the application's use. Mlekus et al. [22] examined UX characteristics that positively influenced technology acceptance. Their findings suggested that perspicuity and dependability positively influenced perceived ease of use, while stimulation significantly impacted behavioral intention.In their work, Saleh et al.

"while stimulation significantly impacted behavioral intention.In their work, Saleh et al. [9] evaluated UX on LMS. Their findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty have positive mean scores, with perspicuity having the highest positive mean score. Their results indicated that end-users had a positive experience with the LMS. In addition, they compared UX on LMS to benchmark datasets of other software and applications. Their results showed that, except for dependability that had an above average score, attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, stimulation, and novelty were all ranked as good. In general, the LMS has adequate UX to be accepted and used. Saleh et al. [23] in their study observed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty have high positive mean scores. Compared with the UEQ benchmark datasets, attractiveness, efficiency, dependability, and stimulation were all considered excellent. Novelty and perspicuity were categorized as good. Thus, the application's UX evaluation had a positive impression, and end-users were generally satisfied in using the application. Similarly, Kushendriawan et al. [24] conducted a study that evaluated the UX of a mobile health application. Their results indicated that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, novelty, stimulation, and dependability all had positive mean score values. In comparison with the UEQ benchmark datasets,"
