"by Aleksander is to develop and evaluate the main human factor (PHF) model and confirm the significant impact of PHF on the success of traditional CSF and projects [5]. However, the development of the main human critical success factor model for the implementation of the ERP system is by no means simple, and the feasibility of the study is not high.The innovation of this article is as follows: (1) Due to the drawbacks of the traditional logistics information system and ERP system, the logistics function of the ERP system has been strengthened, so that the logistics information management system based on ERP not only has strong logistics processing capabilities, but also maintains the ERP system. Other information processing capabilities are as follows: (2) The development and implementation of an ERP-based logistics information management system not only reduces the operating costs of the logistics business system, but also reduces logistics costs.2. Research Method of ERP System in Supply Chain Enterprise Logistics Information Management System2.1. ERP SystemEnterprise resource planning is a combination of modern advanced information technology and systematic management concepts based on supply chain-oriented management ideas (integrating relevant parts and their various links into its operations) [6-8]. By closely integrating business and construction processes with the supply and demand system, plan, design, and control the company's logistics, capital flow, work flow,"
"ideas (integrating relevant parts and their various links into its operations) [6-8]. By closely integrating business and construction processes with the supply and demand system, plan, design, and control the company's logistics, capital flow, work flow, and value-added flow, etc., and rationally arrange the organization's production, supply, and marketing activities, so that the organization can use all resources in a timely manner. It is an integrated information management system and management platform that supports the organization's decision-making, production, and operation [9].2.1.1. The Definition and Development of ERPIn the early 1990s, Gartner Group Inc., a well-known American computer technology consulting and evaluation team based on the development of computer data processing technology and the needs of enterprise supply chain management at the time, predicted this trend [10,11]. In the information age, the development of production management information systems and the upcoming changes make it possible for the concept of ERP and the planning of business resources.ERP is a complete system that can collect all internal resources of the organization and execute effective planning and control to achieve maximum benefits [12]. Its goal is to improve information, logistics, capital flow, value flow, and business flow by using programming and control as a benchmark and using network and information technology as a platform to integrate marketing, sales, and"
"maximum benefits [12]. Its goal is to improve information, logistics, capital flow, value flow, and business flow by using programming and control as a benchmark and using network and information technology as a platform to integrate marketing, sales, and customers and improve customer satisfaction [13]. Functions such as market, planning, production, financing, quality, service, data integration, and business process reengineering (BPR) are combined to solve the concepts and methods of supply chain management (SCM) [14].It can be divided into three levels: management ideas, software products, and management systems [12].(1) The standard business management system proposed by Garter Group Inc. is developed based on MRPII (Manufacturing Resource Planning). This is a management concept that supports the supply chain. (2) With integrating client/server systems, relational database structure, object-oriented technology, graphical user interface, fourth-generation language (4GL), network communication software products, another success in the information industry is based on the idea of ERP management [2,15]. (3) A business resource management system combines corporate management concepts, business processes, basic information, human resources and materials, computer hardware and software.

"human resources and materials, computer hardware and software. The internal and external resources of the enterprise organization are managed and optimally configured through the network. The conceptual hierarchy of a new generation of management information system [16] ERP that manages information at the enterprise level can be shown in Figure1:Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe conceptual hierarchy of ERP.The development of ERP has gone through four main development stages [5,17]:The first step: MRP (Material Requirements Design) was created in the 1960s and is mainly used for procurement management and inventory control. Its main function is to use BOM, inventory information, and main production plan to calculate material requirements.The second stage: Closed-loop MRP was created based on MRP in the 1970s. It combines original capacity planning, capacity demand planning, production, and procurement, creating feedback and creating a closed loop.The third stage: MRPII.The fourth stage: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) was born in the early 1990s. On the basis of MRPII, functions such as distribution management, human resource management, logistics management, quality management, and decision support systems were added. Everything is an extension from supplier to customer. ERP uses advanced information technology, such as network technology, Internet, graphical interface, fourth-generation computer language, relational database, distributed database processing, and"
"Everything is an extension from supplier to customer. ERP uses advanced information technology, such as network technology, Internet, graphical interface, fourth-generation computer language, relational database, distributed database processing, and open client/server system. As a result, the integration capabilities are enhanced and the organization's global operations can be supported.2.1.2. Superiority of ERP SystemERP system will bring direct and indirect benefits to enterprises; the following are its advantages [18,19]:(1)Business integration: At this time, it is the most advantageous point of all the advantages, because the ERP system can realize the promotion of group business.(2)It is highly adaptable: This is the second important advantage of the ERP system. The ERP system can handle different currencies and accounting standards as a whole and at the same time carry out the execution of different functions and assign them to different departments for implementation. This adaptability is the basic prerequisite for adapting to the general trend of the organization and maintaining the unity of the system.(3)Better analysis and planning capabilities: ERP systems can make full use of various decision support systems and decision simulation functions to comprehensively use relevant business data in real time, so that decision makers have strong support, can ensure the correctness of decisions, and make decisions.

"and decision simulation functions to comprehensively use relevant business data in real time, so that decision makers have strong support, can ensure the correctness of decisions, and make decisions. The correct strategy leads the development of the enterprise.(4)Ability to apply the latest and most advanced technology: In order to benefit from the new development of technology, ERP suppliers must quickly adjust their ERP systems, because ERP systems can adapt to today's fast-developing technology and gain in the information age. Operation enables companies to better adapt to the ever-changing business environment.2.2. B/S Architecture and C/S ArchitectureMy country's software development industry has gone from the initial workshop slash-and-burn development to the current iterative development method of prototypes using advanced UML development concepts. During this period, many detours have been taken and many advanced concepts have been introduced from abroad [20]. After getting rid of the initial low-efficiency standalone operation mode, software development has gradually developed toward network interconnection. From local area networks to metropolitan area networks to the Internet, the impact of software on our lives and the promotion of productivity have become more and more significant. Among them, the more representative software developed with C/S architecture model are QQ, Fox-mail, antivirus software, input method, mobile phone APP, etc., while the application"
"and the promotion of productivity have become more and more significant. Among them, the more representative software developed with C/S architecture model are QQ, Fox-mail, antivirus software, input method, mobile phone APP, etc., while the application system built using B/S architecture includes e-mail system, personnel management system, CMS system, etc. [21,22].2.2.1. The Difference between B/S and C/S Architecture(1)Difference in hardware environment:The C/S architecture uses special software to be placed on the client side and the server side. The operation of the special software takes up a lot of server resources and requires more server hardware [23]. Its professional application software requires no small server data occupancy space, server memory resources, and controller clock resources. The B/S architecture uses the browser-side software and Web-logic middleware software that most people have and uses the HTTP network interworking protocol, which has less restrictions on hardware and is suitable for large-scale crowd use [24].(2)Difference in safety requirements:The C/S architecture is mainly used in small-scale enterprises and institutions with high security requirements. It has relatively high security requirements for data transmission security, terminal access server authentication, and user-side filling-in information security. The B/S architecture is mainly oriented to a wider range of user groups. Although encrypted transmission can be carried out through"
"for data transmission security, terminal access server authentication, and user-side filling-in information security. The B/S architecture is mainly oriented to a wider range of user groups. Although encrypted transmission can be carried out through HTTPS protocol and other methods, it has lower requirements for security and higher requirements for user experience and ease of use [25].(3)Difference in system operation and maintenance:The C/S architecture is more complicated for the system operation and maintenance level. Since its architecture is inseparable as a whole, it is necessary to update the other end correspondingly to achieve the interconnection of data transmission on both sides when upgrading and updating on the server side or the client side. The system operation and maintenance work of this information system architecture is relatively complicated, and the system operation and maintenance cost will be relatively higher. The coupling of the B/S architecture is very loose. The server end is upgraded and the client end does not need to be upgraded. The B end of the B/S architecture can use the user's browser to compete, and the B end of the B/S architecture can be in multiple. The system uses a browser to access, the operation and maintenance cost of this architecture is not high, and the operation and maintenance will be enhanced day by day [26].(4)Differences in interface modes:The access mode of the C/S architecture is based on the Internet protocol suite, and"
"the operation and maintenance cost of this architecture is not high, and the operation and maintenance will be enhanced day by day [26].(4)Differences in interface modes:The access mode of the C/S architecture is based on the Internet protocol suite, and some special application business requirements are built on the network layer or data link layer. The application system server will select the most suitable development language protocol according to a variety of situations, and the meaning of each byte of data is clearly regulated. The interface protocol of the B/S architecture basically uses the HTTP protocol, and the interface method uses the Web-Service interface. The specifications of its data packets have been clearly stipulated by the international ISO organization, and the relevant protocols need to be identified during the research and development process.(5)Differences in database connection methods:The client side of the C/S architecture requires relatively short data flow display and storage time. The communication between the client side and the server side is very frequent, so the C/S architecture server and the client are always connected. As long as there is a data request demand, it can be responded to immediately, although this will consume a lot of database resources, but because the architecture generally has a relatively small number of terminals and high real-time performance of the business, most of them adopt this method. For example, a typical case"
"although this will consume a lot of database resources, but because the architecture generally has a relatively small number of terminals and high real-time performance of the business, most of them adopt this method. For example, a typical case of C/S architecture often linking is the banking system business.2.2.2. Advantages of B/S and C/S ArchitectureAdvantages of B/S architecture: (1) Wide range of applications: OS systems with browsers such as Chrome and Firefox can access the server-side application part according to established specifications, and the server-side application part can also provide on-demand services anytime, anywhere. (2) Low operation and maintenance costs: The architecture server-side maintenance or function update client does not need to cooperate, so that what you see is what you get is synchronized. (3) Low R&D cost and high efficiency: The TCP/IP protocol suite of the Internet contains many subprotocols, and the use of these protocols is the basic of B/S architecture communication [27].Advantages of C/S architecture: (1) There is fast response speed. (2) Strong transaction processing capabilities: Application system development with targeted and dedicated personnel is the main advantage of the C/S architecture, which can be customized very personally for users. (3) The interface is highly friendly and can meet the unique needs of users. The client software is developed completely according to user needs. (4) High security: For client-side"
"the C/S architecture, which can be customized very personally for users. (3) The interface is highly friendly and can meet the unique needs of users. The client software is developed completely according to user needs. (4) High security: For client-side management and control, the client side can be accompanied by a security scanning function, and a dedicated transmission protocol is used in the transmission process. The transmission protocol can use either an internationally accepted encryption protocol or an encryption method set by yourself to ensure the security of the transmitted data. Since the server side of the C/S architecture is developed by enterprises and institutions, information leakage caused by backdoors of foreign service software can be basically eliminated. (5) High data scalability: Most of the C/S architecture systems use large databases such as Oracle and DB2. This kind of database has strong data scalability in terms of subdatabase, query, and analysis of massive data. (6) Massive computing power: Most of the work that consumes server-side system resources, such as data calculation and information processing, can be placed on the client side [28].2.3.

"FormMultiple regression analysis is one of the methods to quantitatively predict the development and change of things based on social economic phenomena. Quantitatively analyze the reasons for growth and the motivation of things, obtain the quantitative relationship between the variables of things, and then predict their growth and motivation [29]. Suppose that the predicted object iswand the factor that affects the predicted object isxi, wherei= 1,2,3, ... is the number of influencing factors.xiare independent of each other, and you should not choose too many factors that affectw; otherwise there will be problems such as multilinearity and heteroscedasticity, which will affect the accuracy of the prediction results. In order to avoid the collinearity problem in the prediction process in advance, the correlation coefficientLcan be used to detect the correlation of the independence.(1)Among them,xiis the selected predictor, the average value is, and the general correlation coefficientL< 0.3 considers that there is no correlation between the predictors; that is, the predictors are independent of each other.After the correct selection of influencing factors, we assume that there is a linear correlation between the predictor and the predicted object; that is,w=f(x1,x2,x3, ...,xk) is a linear function, and the multiple regression model is established as(2)Among them,β1,β2, ...,βkis called regression coefficient,β0is a constant term, both can be called regression parameters,"

The Research Experiment of ERP System in the Logistics Information Management System of Supply Chain Enterprises3.1. System Architecture of System ImplementationThe system mainly solves the following problems: the process of information transmission is not smooth, the efficiency of the delivery process is too low, the ability to integrate resources is weak, and the efficiency and service level cannot meet the general standards required by the enterprise.In view of the development requirements of logistics informatization and the development trend in the"
"is too low, the ability to integrate resources is weak, and the efficiency and service level cannot meet the general standards required by the enterprise.In view of the development requirements of logistics informatization and the development trend in the transportation management process, advanced logistics information technology must integrate advanced logistics management concepts, and the combination of practice and theory promotes the smooth completion of research and development. Aiming at the system architecture, the logistics company transportation management system is a platform with great advantages. It is oriented to multiparty logistics transportation and belongs to the multidimensional logistics transportation business at the management business level. The system needs to face different enterprise customers in specific operations and meet the different needs of customers, which requires the system to achieve complex functions in business. Therefore, the logistics and transportation information management system must realize the multidimensional architecture of the system, so the system is divided into a multilayer structure, and each level has an interactive relationship. The development and design of this system mainly adopt the B/S structure.

The specific structure is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointLogistics system implementation framework.System layer: It provides software support for users' normal operating system, including the system platform installed by the user, the database system installed by the user, and the corresponding software, which are the basics of the system. Service layer: It is the part that is built on the application basic platform and provides services for the system. The application basic platform integrates the development of the logistics transportation system, the integration of various applications, and the foundation of e-commerce. The platform provides corresponding services for the system, helping the system to exchange data at the bottom, relying on the system layer to share data, exchange data with different applications, and provide system log services, catalog management, development frameworks, user permissions, etc. It provides an excuse for daily work and general applications, and it is a portal for external systems to access the system. The service layer also provides the encapsulation of some general classes, as well as the service classes commonly used in the system, providing transaction control, data query, security control, system management, and other aspects of interacting data with the bottom layer of the data. The business logic layer is mainly for handling various logistics-related business processes."
"system, providing transaction control, data query, security control, system management, and other aspects of interacting data with the bottom layer of the data. The business logic layer is mainly for handling various logistics-related business processes. The business logic layer performs data operations by calling each package class of the service layer. The presentation layer is the layer where the user touches the system and displays the corresponding system functions most intuitively to the user.3.2. Physical Architecture of the SystemAccording to the description of the architecture, the realization of the physical architecture of the system is divided into three layers based on the B/S structure, which are the view layer, the business layer, and the data layer in turn.The workflow of the logistics system is as follows: First, the user may have multiple browsers. When the user's browser sends a request to the middleware, the system judges whether the user has the authority to perform the corresponding operation according to the current user's login information session. If it meets the requirements, the web application server will process the browser-side request, find the corresponding processing method, start the data layer service, process the data, and return the processed data and results to the web server container, and the web server container returns to the web server container. Request support for concurrent operations. From the above operations, the network"
"layer service, process the data, and return the processed data and results to the web server container, and the web server container returns to the web server container. Request support for concurrent operations. From the above operations, the network topology of the logistics system is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe network topology of the logistics system (this picture is borrowed from baidu encyclopedia).ERP-based enterprise logistics systems have certain characteristics, such as consistency and convenience of projects, unification and sharing, decision-making flexibility, unification of advanced simulation and forecasting, capital flow and information flow, etc. These functions indicate business logistics based on ERP. The information system is a complete pillar logistics management system. Realize the overall benefits of production and logistics services in effective management, and enhance the company's overall competitiveness. Several experienced consultants talked about their experience in implementing IT logistics systems for ERP-based companies and said that, to successfully implement an ERP system, three points depend on technology, seven points on talents, and twelve points on data. Although this statement is a bit exaggerated, computers can only function if the information is correct, complete, and timely; otherwise they will produce wrong results.

"Although this statement is a bit exaggerated, computers can only function if the information is correct, complete, and timely; otherwise they will produce wrong results. In other words, the product database is the basis for the operation of enterprise logistics IT systems with ERP capabilities. The application scope and depth of the ERP-based business logistics system depend on the company's needs, coverage, and information content. Therefore, it is very important to prepare and maintain a product database.3.3. System Detailed Design3.3.1. Code DesignThere are the following principles in code design: (1) The design code must be optimized to meet the needs of users. When designing the code, pay attention to whether the loop condition is an infinite loop. When updating the database, you must close the connection and close the read and write stream when reading and writing files. (2) A class represents a method, trying to put some common methods and common constants into the common class. (3) When designing the code, write enough comments so that the maintenance personnel can directly understand the specific meaning of the written code and quickly locate the code that needs to be modified. (4) The writing of the code must conform to standardization. If it is a constant, it must be static. If the parameter passed by the method it is a static parameter.3.3.2.

"to standardization. If it is a constant, it must be static. If the parameter passed by the method it is a static parameter.3.3.2. Database DesignDatabase design refers to the process of establishing a database that meets business needs after the system implementer has selected specific database software. When designing a database, three stages are required: conceptual design, logical design, and physical design.(1)Database conceptual structure designThe database conceptual structure design is a conceptual model designed according to the needs of the enterprise. It is an abstract expression of a concrete relationship. It embodies the connection between virtual life and reality, and it does not require hardware and software environmental support.(2)Database logical structure designLogical structure design is to convert the conceptual model completed in the conceptual structure design stage into a data model that can be supported by the selected database management system (DBMS).4. Experimental Results and Analysis4.1. Database Design AnalysisThe conceptual design of the database is only a simple description of the system database design, and it does not describe the system data requirements in detail.

ConclusionsThis paper proposes that the development of an ERP-based enterprise logistics information system is not a pure logistics information system. The idea is to integrate the logistics function modules of ERP on the basis of ERP and add appropriate other modules. After analyzing the current ERP system and based on the logistics system, an enterprise logistics information system based on ERP is designed in detail.The research value of this article is reflected in the following:(1)Integrated ERP logistics module improves the response speed and accuracy of the system.(2)Fully consider adopting modern cost control methods to manage the smooth progress of development projects and ensure the financial guarantee for system development.(3)The designed system not only meets the needs of large-scale enterprises, but also suits the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Different companies can customize corresponding modules according to their own needs, so as to meet the application requirements that are in line with actual business needs, and achieve the greatest cost-effectiveness and efficiency.(5)The information sharing between the system and other ERP systems is fully considered. Information sharing is the most difficult and most valuable aspect of designing a system.Conflicts of InterestAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Research on the Return Mechanism of Social Capital Investment Based on PPP Model of Pension Service (SK2019A0561) and Research on the Economic Transformation of Resource-Based Cities in Anhui Province from the Perspective of Regional Economic Elasticity (SK2020A0426).Open ResearchData AvailabilityNo data were used to support this study.References1Kitouni I.,Benmerzoug D., andLezzar F.,Smart agricultural enterprise system based on integration of Internet of things and agent technology,Journal of Organizational and End User Computing.

"AbstractAs a treasure of Chinese medicine, TCM has gradually formed and developed into a complete medicine with a unique medical theory system and rich treatment experience after thousands of years of medical practice. It requires high diagnostic experience, which is not conducive to application promotion and management. Therefore, the concept of digital medicine has been recognized by more and more people, in which medical diagnosis is one of the core issues of digital medicine. The accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis are closely related to people's life and health, which is an important problem that cannot be ignored. Use the growing case base as knowledge base to reason and realize the diagnosis function of traditional Chinese medicine. Based on the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine and taking case reasoning as a model, an expert system of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis is established. This paper combines the strong learning ability, strong adaptability, and large-scale parallel processing ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to solve the nonlinear and unstructured complex problems in management information system. By improving BP algorithm to optimize the error of weight and repair or energy parameters, the overall error of the optimized system is reduced by about 75.3% after experimental analysis, and the average accuracy of prediction is 75%.1.

IntroductionIn the field of traditional Chinese medicine, the data is huge, the generation speed is fast, the structure is complex, and it has the characteristics of diversity, incompleteness, redundancy, privacy, ambiguity, and nonlinearity [1]. The structure of medical diagnosis system is very complex, there are many factors that need to be referred to, and the correlation between factors is very strong, so it is difficult to consider it comprehensively [2]. At present, in the process of medical treatment, the diagnosis of diseases by doctors is still in a traditional experience stage, which mainly depends on the practical experience of clinicians, various diagnostic indicators, and experimental examination results. A full-time doctor usually needs several years of practice to accumulate certain diagnostic experience [3]. Diagnostics is the use of medical knowledge to make a reasonable diagnosis of a disease based on clinical symptoms [4]. Unevenly distributed medical data is a difficult problem in the field of data mining, but neural network is one of the few analysis tools that can be used in this field [5]. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that there is interaction and causality between objects, and man is also an organic unity [6]. The local pathological changes of human body interact with"
"of the few analysis tools that can be used in this field [5]. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that there is interaction and causality between objects, and man is also an organic unity [6]. The local pathological changes of human body interact with the systemic pathological changes, and the systemic pathological changes can be reflected locally, and the local pathological changes may also produce systemic pathological reactions [7]. Clinical symptoms and TCM syndromes are the relationship between phenomenon and essence. Any syndrome has clinical symptoms, which reflects the basic law of syndrome development [8]. Different stages of TCM syndromes have different clinical symptoms, which reflect the nature of stages.For the current general database management system, all it can do is carry out some simple query and report statistics, which cannot keep up with the needs of the times [9]. Faced with such a huge database, people want to process and analyze these data at a higher level to get the general characteristics of the data and the prediction of the development trend [10]. ANN is a simulation of human brain system, which reflects many basic features of human brain function, but it is not a true portrayal of human brain nervous system, but a simplification and abstraction [11].

"brain nervous system, but a simplification and abstraction [11]. The purpose of our research on ANN is to study the basic mechanism of human brain storing and processing information and apply this principle to the actual engineering construction and the realization of related problems, so as to provide a practical method for solving a certain kind of problems [12]. It is generally believed that all biological nerve functions, including memory, are stored in neurons and their connections. Although the standard BP model has great advantages in all aspects, there are still many problems [13]. For example, the convergence speed of the learning algorithm is slow, it is easy to fall into the local minimum, and the network is only one-way propagation, which makes the learning results unsatisfactory [14]. It should be said that the key part of neural network modeling is the selection of its parameters. According to experiments and experience, the initial weight of BP model must be a small random number. Learning is seen as the process of establishing new connections between neurons or modifying existing connections [15]. Management information system is an information system with computer as a tool and system idea, which has the functions of data processing and decision-making and serves management.Based on this, this paper mainly studies the application of ANN in the informatization of TCM diagnosis, in order to give full play to the recognition degree of ANN technology in TCM"
"functions of data processing and decision-making and serves management.Based on this, this paper mainly studies the application of ANN in the informatization of TCM diagnosis, in order to give full play to the recognition degree of ANN technology in TCM inspection and promote the development of TCM diagnosis in the direction of informatization. Hope to optimize the management information system in the improved BP neural network algorithm.The process and characteristics of relevant neural network algorithm, evidence combination theory, and correlation algorithm are combed and briefly described, and an optimized neural network algorithm is established. The innovative contributions include the combination of natural language processing technology and data preprocessing methods to screen and process chaotic medical data. Chinese word segmentation of medical data, correlation research of medical symptoms, and quantitative processing of Chinese data are included. These are different from the traditional data processing. By training the symptom word vector, we can mine the semantic information of symptoms and diseases. In terms of node prediction accuracy, considering the application environment, the average accuracy is 75%, which can well meet the performance requirements of the application.2. Methodology2.1.

"can well meet the performance requirements of the application.2. Methodology2.1. Research and Analysis of ANNArtificial neural network has four basic characteristics. (1) Nonlinear relationship is a universal characteristic of nature. Brain intelligence is a nonlinear phenomenon. Artificial neurons are in two different states of activation or inhibition. This behavior is mathematically nonlinear. The network composed of neurons with threshold has better performance and can improve fault tolerance and storage capacity. (2) Nonlocality a neural network is usually composed of multiple neurons widely connected. The overall behavior of a system depends not only on the characteristics of a single neuron, but also on the interaction and interconnection between units. Simulate the nonlimitation of the brain through a large number of connections between units. Associative memory is a typical example of nonlimitation. (3) Very qualitative artificial neural network has the ability of self-adaptation, self-organization, and self-learning. Not only can the information processed by neural network have various changes, but also the nonlinear dynamic system itself is constantly changing while processing information. Iterative process is often used to describe the evolution process of dynamic system. (4) Nonconvex evolution direction of a system will depend on a specific state function under certain conditions.

"used to describe the evolution process of dynamic system. (4) Nonconvex evolution direction of a system will depend on a specific state function under certain conditions. For example, the extreme value of energy function corresponds to the relatively stable state of the system. Nonconvexity means that this function has multiple extreme values, so the system has multiple stable equilibrium states, which will lead to the diversity of system evolution.ANN is a certain abstraction and simulation of biological neural network. Over the past decade, the research of ANN, more accurately, the application research of ANN, has reached unprecedented breadth and depth [16]. However, as its unique advantages, strong learning ability, strong adaptability, and large-scale parallel processing have not been clearly shown [17]. The prototype of the ANN is the biological neural network, which is constructed with reference to the structure and action or stimulation principles of the biological neural network. It uses information processing technology and network topology knowledge to simulate a kind of complex information processing and corresponding mathematical model [18]. The model has the ability of parallel distributed processing, high fault tolerance, and self-learning ability. It combines the acquired information through processing and storage and has attracted the attention of people in all walks of life with its unique knowledge expression and adaptive learning ability [19]. The basic"

It combines the acquired information through processing and storage and has attracted the attention of people in all walks of life with its unique knowledge expression and adaptive learning ability [19]. The basic unit of artificial network is neuron, and the neuron model structure includes input part, output part, and calculation function part [20]. After obtaining the weighted sum of the value of the input features and their corresponding weights, a scalar result is obtained through a nonlinear activation recursive function. The basic structure diagram of the neural network structure is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBasic structure diagram of neural network structure.The input layer receives the external signal and introduces it into the neural network. The hidden layer is located between the input layer and the output layer and is divided into one or more layers to process the input information and transfer the processed information to the output layer [21]. Forward propagation is the process that the input characteristic information enters the neural network from the input layer, passes through several intermediate layers, and finally outputs to the output layer. Backward propagation of errors is the process of propagating the error information from the output layer to the input layer in a reverse direction [22]. Nodes are usually represented as(1)In the above formula,a1,a2,a3 represent three nodes of the"

Nodes are usually represented as(1)In the above formula,a1,a2,a3 represent three nodes of the input layer, respectively,Wijrepresents the weight, andgis a nonlinear activation function, which mainly maps the weighted value nonlinearly. The final node in the above formula is obtained by continuously weighted summation and nonlinear transformation of the previous values. In addition, it is necessary to express the offset node. LetA1,A2,Trepresent the transmission vector in the network,W1,W2 be the matrix parameter, andB1,B2 represent the offset vector. The mathematical expression of at this time is(2)ANN is an adaptive and nonlinear information processing system composed of a large number of interconnected processing units, which is produced by trying to simulate the way of memory and processing information of neurons in the brain [23]. It is proposed on the basis of modern neuroscience research results. Its basic characteristics mainly include the following four points: nonlinearity, nonlimitation, very qualitative, and nonconvexity. Figure2is a schematic diagram of a typical M-P model.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe basic model architecture of M-P.It can be seen from the above model that the actual output of neurons in ANN is determined by input unit, connection weight, and threshold, and its output value"
"a typical M-P model.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe basic model architecture of M-P.It can be seen from the above model that the actual output of neurons in ANN is determined by input unit, connection weight, and threshold, and its output value can be regarded as a function of the three [24]. In practical applications, the input signalXi(X= 1,2, ...,n) often appears in the form of a vector, which is called an input sample. Generally, three excitation functions are obtained.The excitation function of linear neurons is(3)The excitation function of threshold neurons is(4)About the excitation function of nonlinear neurons,(5)2.2. Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis Information and Data ProcessingArtificial neural network is the abstraction of human brain neuron network. It is an operation model, which is composed of a large number of nodes (or neurons) connected with each other. Each node represents a specific output function, called the activation function. The connection between every two nodes represents a weighted value for the signal passing through the connection, which is called the weight. The output of the network varies according to the connection mode of the network, the weight value, and the excitation function. The network itself is usually the approximation of some algorithm or function in nature, or the expression of a logical strategy.

"function. The network itself is usually the approximation of some algorithm or function in nature, or the expression of a logical strategy. There are intelligent programs that are specialized in specific fields, have expert level in this field, and can solve related problems in this field. Such programs are called expert systems. The development of ANN theory provides a new and effective way for medical intelligent diagnosis system. In traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis, the training is carried out according to the ANN samples, and the input values of the samples are uploaded to the nodes of the input layer. The ANN calculates and analyzes the received input values and weights and transmits the calculation results through the output layer. Once there is a deviation between the output mode and the sample mode, the ANN supports the adjustment of the network weights. In most cases, people regard expert system as a computer program in a specific field, which possesses the professional knowledge and experience in this field and can simulate the thinking mode of experts in this field and solve difficult problems that only some experts and scholars in this field can solve. The relationship of each part of the expert system is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe relationship structure diagram of each part of the expert system.As can be seen from the above figure, the expert system consists of five parts: knowledge base, knowledge acquisition mechanism,"
"shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe relationship structure diagram of each part of the expert system.As can be seen from the above figure, the expert system consists of five parts: knowledge base, knowledge acquisition mechanism, comprehensive database, reasoning system, human-machine interface, and interpretation text system. Among these five components, the knowledge base and the inference engine are the core and the most difficult to implement, and they are also indispensable. The interpretation part and knowledge acquisition part may not exist in some special fields, but a perfect expert system should have the above five parts at the same time.The knowledge and experience of domain experts are stored in a place called knowledge base. Machines cannot understand human language, so the knowledge of experts needs to be converted into a machine language that can be understood by computers by using appropriate numerical values and symbols according to a rule combination, so that it can become the knowledge base of expert systems. The main criterion to distinguish whether a knowledge base is an intelligent knowledge base or a traditional knowledge base is whether the knowledge base is dynamic or static. During the operation of the expert system, domain experts can detect its running status, and when it is found that there are knowledge errors or omissions in the knowledge base, the knowledge base can be modified, added, or deleted. The theoretical basis"
"During the operation of the expert system, domain experts can detect its running status, and when it is found that there are knowledge errors or omissions in the knowledge base, the knowledge base can be modified, added, or deleted. The theoretical basis of TCM diagnosis system is generally as follows: the meridian theory of TCM and the dialectical theory of Zang Fu organs. According to the syndrome differentiation theory of viscera in traditional Chinese medicine, the human body is essentially a set of control system, and the external performance of the human body is closely related to the condition of viscera in the body. By measuring the external manifestations of human body, such as impedance information, we can get the related problems of internal organs. It can be said that the external impedance information is the reflection of the internal viscera of human body. It is similar to using the degree of regional development to express the diagnosis, as shown in Table1.Table  1.Application of LRD value in system analysis.LRD valueNumber of diagnoses recorded in the sample tablePrecision of prediction (%)LRD > 3.022823.0 < LRD < 4.044954.0 < LRD < 5.567935.5 < LRD < 7.075977.0 < LRD2097It can be seen that, for records with larger actual LRD values, the predicted values are relatively accurate, which is related to the distribution of individual cases in the diagnostic sample.

"with larger actual LRD values, the predicted values are relatively accurate, which is related to the distribution of individual cases in the diagnostic sample. Therefore, when training a neural network, the inclusion of the sample set should be fully considered.2.3. Construction of Information Management Model and Algorithm OptimizationUsually, when developing TCM diagnosis information management system, we need to build a development model according to the needs of users and then develop the software system according to the model. When the fitness performance is equivalent, the individual with small structure size is preferred; for the hidden unit addition variation, only when the structural variation improves the weight evolution learning performance, the new individual with better performance will replace the worst performance of its parent individual, at this time indicating structural evolution. For hidden unit deletion variation, only when the structural variation does not reduce the learning performance of weight evolution, the new individual with better performance will replace the one with the worst performance of its parent, which indicates structural evolution. There are two main ways of development. (1) The latter development method: that is, firstly implement the informatization of an important diagnostic information, gradually expand the system functions on the basis of perfect functions, and then connect the various diagnostic information to each other until"
"development method: that is, firstly implement the informatization of an important diagnostic information, gradually expand the system functions on the basis of perfect functions, and then connect the various diagnostic information to each other until the diagnosis is realized. (2) Chain development mode: that is, first complete the informatization around a diagnosis process of TCM diagnosis information, and then gradually expand and improve to various diagnosis types until the informatization of the whole TCM diagnosis is realized. The mathematical models established by different development methods are also different. Figure4shows the basic schematic diagram of information management system.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe basic principle diagram of the information management system.The traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis information management system developed in this way also has obvious customization characteristics. It is not only not universal in different medical fields, but also difficult to transplant between different diagnosis types in the same field when the current software standards are not unified. Therefore, after long-term knowledge reserve and experience accumulation, a cross-domain management information system development platform based on ANN is proposed to solve a series of thorny problems encountered in traditional customized development and strive to shorten the development time and reduce the development cost.

"information system development platform based on ANN is proposed to solve a series of thorny problems encountered in traditional customized development and strive to shorten the development time and reduce the development cost. The algorithm part of the information management system will be optimized below, so that it can be processed efficiently and accurately in actual operation.From the above ANN algorithm, we can see that BP algorithm has the following characteristics. The learning process is composed of two processes. The weight adjustment process of each layer of signal forward propagation and error backward propagation is repeated. Generally, when the network output is not equal to the expected output, there will be an error, and its mathematical expression is as follows:(6)The definition of the above error is transferred to the hidden layer and calculated as follows:(7)It is further expanded to the input layer and obtained by calculation:(8)It can be seen from the above formula that the network input error is a function of the weightsWjk,Vijof each layer, so adjusting the weights can change the errorE. Obviously, the principle of adjusting the weight is to reduce the error constantly, so the adjustment of the weight should be proportional to the negative gradient of the error; that is,(9)j= 0,1,2, ...,m;k= 1,2, ...,l,i= 0,1,2, ...,n;j= 1,2, ...,m. The negative sign in the formula indicates that the whole gradient is downward, and the constant indicates the"
"the weight should be proportional to the negative gradient of the error; that is,(9)j= 0,1,2, ...,m;k= 1,2, ...,l,i= 0,1,2, ...,n;j= 1,2, ...,m. The negative sign in the formula indicates that the whole gradient is downward, and the constant indicates the proportional coefficient, which reflects the diagnosis rate in the sample. In addition, in the design of knowledge base, it should be defined asW= (U,R), whereUis the domain andRis an equivalent relationship onU. Therefore,(10)Then, IND(B) represents the indistinguishable relationship of any subsetB, andU/Brepresents all equivalence relationships of IND(B). At this time, there are two kinds of approximate definitions: one is the upper approximate definition, which is generally expressed as(11)The other is the following approximate definition, which is generally expressed as(12)SetBNR(X) =R−(X) −R−(X) which defines the boundary domain withXasR. Based on this, in order to speed up the accurate correction of weights, the improved BP algorithm adds an iterative termαΔWij(k) to the formula, which is equivalent to providing a momentum category in the weights and effectively filtering out the high-frequency variables of the error surface of the weight space, as follows:(13)whereαrepresents the relaxation factor, ΔWij(k+ 1) represents the correction of the weight in the next cycle, and ΔWij(k) is the correction of the weight in the previous cycle. Therefore, the above formula can be regarded as a first-order difference equation."
"the relaxation factor, ΔWij(k+ 1) represents the correction of the weight in the next cycle, and ΔWij(k) is the correction of the weight in the previous cycle. Therefore, the above formula can be regarded as a first-order difference equation. When the parameters are of the same sign, the weighted sum value increases. At this time, the stable adjustment increases the adjustment speed of the weight. If the sign is opposite, it indicates that there is oscillation. At this time, the exponential weighting and the result will be reduced, which has a stable effect.3. Result Analysis and DiscussionAt present, the computer system using CPU + GPU hybrid computing mode has the ability to train neural network. In order to establish a scientific, feasible, and efficient TCM diagnostic information management system, this paper further conducts experimental analysis on the basis of the above research and analysis, so as to strengthen the confirmation of the reliability of the system design and observe whether the system can be used in actual operation and whether the diagnosis information of traditional Chinese medicine can be well managed. Therefore, this paper will analyze and judge from several important indicators, such as average error, fitness value distribution rate, information accuracy, and node prediction accuracy.

When the overall error is less than 0.4 or the number of iterations reaches the maximum, the training ends. After N iterations of training, the training of the model is terminated due to excessive parameters. It can be seen from the figure that, in thentraining process, the mean square error after the A, B, and C iterations is 48.7%. The cross-validation result at this time is the best, and the overall error of the system is reduced by about 75.3% after optimization. Through the above algorithm to train the disease diagnosis model based on BP network, the fitness value increases obviously afterntimes.

The data analysis diagrams are shown in Figures7and8.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation accuracy analysis diagram.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointAnalysis of node prediction accuracy.Because the accuracy of information determines the reliability of the management system, attention should be paid to the screening of information. Therefore, this paper designs this part in the experimental part. After inputting the data, it is found that due to the lack of a complete information chain and analysis mode in the early input of diagnostic information, there is a large fluctuation between different sample sets. However, as the number of iterations continues to increase, the results will obviously increase or decrease with the same trend, which also indicates that the stability of the system designed in this paper is optimized, and it basically keeps increasing after interval 3-4, with the growth rate basically keeping at the average level of 68.4%.

The training time is the lowest when the hidden layer node is the least, which is 3 seconds. The analysis shows that the number of hidden layer nodes will have a certain impact on the prediction accuracy, but there is little difference in prediction time. Considering the application environment, it should be considered to select 2 with high prediction accuracy as the number of hidden layer nodes, with an accuracy of 75%, which can meet the performance requirements of the application.4.

"AbstractThe purpose of this study is to design an information management system, which can be used for oil and gas pipeline path planning, oil and gas production scheduling, oil and gas data statistical analysis, and other functions. In this study, a production management information system for oil and gas storage and transportation based on the Internet of Things and GIS technology is proposed. Through the integration of Internet and GIS technology, it can accurately analyze the path planning of oil and gas pipelines. The experiment proves the reliability of the system, and in the aspect of path planning, the simulated path of the system will be 20-30 km shorter than the original laying path, especially for long-distance pipeline laying, which can be reduced by about 30 km.1. IntroductionThe efficient use of energy has always been our pursuit, especially now that the resources are depleted day by day. Oil and gas resources are the most widely used and longest used resources in the world, and people have been working on their efficient storage and transportation. As a product of modern high-tech, the oil and gas storage and transportation production information system has provided tremendous help for oil and gas storage, transportation and safety management. The Internet of Things and GIS technology are also new technologies that should be developed and used in various industries.

"and safety management. The Internet of Things and GIS technology are also new technologies that should be developed and used in various industries. In developed countries, the research on the Internet of Things and GIS has been relatively long, and the research on oil and gas storage and transportation is relatively in-depth. As an energy source, China is in urgent need of high-efficiency technologies for oil and gas storage and transportation. Therefore, it is now managing oil and gas storage and transportation production. Research on information systems is very necessary.In the 21st century, people have realized that energy is slowly depleting, and the awareness of the energy crisis is gradually becoming stronger. Therefore, there are many research studies on oil and gas storage and transportation and GIS technology. Al-Rojaie discussed the opinions of Qassimi Arabic speakers on the linguistic variation of their own dialects, and the socio-cultural evaluations related to their opinions. Using geographic information system (GIS) mapping software for analysis, their research shows that it is necessary to further explore the potential ideologies and social values of Arabic speakers of their own dialects and other dialects in the Arabic community [1].

"in the Arabic community [1]. Xia et al. used D-InSAR new mining subsidence monitoring to accurately obtain surface deformation and established a temporal and spatial relationship model between surface deformation and underground mining characterized by subsidence. A fast, efficient, and accurate method for identifying illegal underground mining areas has been developed [2]. Orimoloye and Ololade and others used GIS technology to study a series of ecological and environmental impacts of gold mining operations. Research results show that areas with low index values are easily affected by mining and other human activities, while areas with high index values mean little or no impact [3]. Liu et al. believe that with the rapid development of computer technology, GIS technology can be combined with database programming. However, the progress of science and technology is contrary to the principle of harmonious development between man and nature. Global warming caused by excessive carbon dioxide pollution may be the most serious environmental problem [4]. Although there are many related studies, there are still many aspects that can be strengthened for the research on oil and gas storage, transportation, and production information management systems.This article proposes the following innovations for the Internet of Things technology: (1) Propose an information management system for oil and gas storage, transportation, and production based on the Internet of Things GIS technology."
"management systems.This article proposes the following innovations for the Internet of Things technology: (1) Propose an information management system for oil and gas storage, transportation, and production based on the Internet of Things GIS technology. Before this, most of them were based on artificial intelligence systems or sensor networks.

Internet of Things Technology and Cloud ComputingAs shown in Figure1, the perception layer is at the foundation, and is at the bottom of the three-layer architecture. Its main function is to identify objects, perceive the environment, and collect information. With the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China and major special funds for science and technology, the research on the sensing layer technology of the Internet of Things industry in China, such as network communication technology and sensor network, has made continuous progress.

"tags and readers, video capture equipment, wireless sensor nodes, etc. [5,6]. The demand for big data transmission and processing platforms is a problem that the Internet of Things industry must face in the transmission network. The main technologies include embedded technology, sensor technology, item identification technology, control technology, etc. The transport layer, also called the network layer, is responsible for efficiently, reliably, and safely sending the data collected by the perception layer through a variety of networks. It solves the problem of data transmission, especially the problem of long-distance transmission [7,8]. The Internet of Things is characterized by comprehensive perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing, and it is a network that can connect the physical world. The network here is not a brand-new network but is based on the mobile communication network and the Internet. The integration and expansion of various existing networks is the combination of wired and wireless, broadband and narrowband, sensing networks, and communication networks. The combination of networks can provide all kinds of users with an intelligent selection of the mode of access to the network.

Although academics have not given a unified explanation to cloud computing, there is a saying that is widely accepted by the public. It is the development result of cloud computing, distributed computing, parallel computing, practical computing, network storage technology, virtualization, load balancing, and other traditional computer technologies. Cloud computing aims to provide users with cloud architecture nodes, and integrate a large number of relatively low-cost computer entities through the Internet or LAN to form a computer system with strong computing power. Under the SOA framework, with the help of three service providers of cloud computing: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and other advanced software models, this distributed cloud computing system with super performance has reached the hands of users.With the continuous advancement of technical means, the popularization and application of various advanced sensing technologies and equipment, the application prospects of the Internet of Things are very broad, and more and more sensors are deployed in a wide range of production and life fields, from national"
"popularization and application of various advanced sensing technologies and equipment, the application prospects of the Internet of Things are very broad, and more and more sensors are deployed in a wide range of production and life fields, from national security, public health, Facilitate transportation and other government public management, to smart homes, health checks, convenient payment and other daily life of the people, and are connected by the Internet and communication technology. The physical world is free from the constraints of time and space through the digital world and can present us more accurately. The application of the Internet of Things is to connect items through sensing devices and networks to realize automatic and real-time identification, positioning, and other supervision and management activities of objects, so as to achieve the corresponding demand goals of managers and consumers for items [11,12]. The most common application in oil and gas storage and transportation is the Internet of Things (IoT) network for oil field exploitation and transportation, which links various devices through the network for unified deployment.2.2.

"edge science. It is involved in many research fields such as information science, computer science, and space science. The data of its geographic database includes graphic data, attribute data, positioning data, remote sensing data, etc. These data are obtained through surveys and collection. GIS was first put forward by geographers in Canada, so all geographic databases are foreign data, and domestic users need to input their own data. The geographical information system is based on a geographic database, analyzes and processes the operation process related to these data, and provides the researcher with decision-making and planning services [13].As shown in Figure2, the geographic system mainly includes four major components. One is the hardware system, including hardware devices such as computers, servers, and geographic detectors that make up the GIS. The second is a software system, which is a geographic information system developed based on GIS, which can complete certain operational tasks. The third is geographic data. The basic principle of GIS is based on geographic data, so it must be correct for geographic data. The fourth is users.

"users. For ordinary users, it is more to use the original functions, while professional users can further develop functions based on the system and enjoy higher authority. GIS is mainly used to process geographic-related information data. Geographical information data has its own particularities. First of all, its spatial and geographic features, such as spatial location data LBS (location-based services) common longitude and latitude coordinate data, and finally, the intersection and separation of data between objects. Then there are its attribute characteristic data, such as the length, width, directionality, start point, and end point of the road data. Then there is its time-domain characteristic data, such as the time of data collection. The application of GIS technology is very extensive, involving many industries. In logistics management, it allocates resources according to the corresponding road access and material flow. It also allocates materials efficiently and reasonably in the military and urban management. In large-scale urban construction, the planning of roads, sports venues, parking lots, green spaces, etc., enables the rational distribution of facilities and the efficient use of resources [14,15].Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.3.

"different industries and different economic systems. Classification of energy-saving planning is necessary. In the existing development model, as long as there are sufficient macro data and information support technology, a more reasonable professional energy-saving and emission-reduction spatial information system can be constructed, and more specific and targeted energy-saving planning can be established. For example, the energy-saving and emission-reduction development plan of natural gas enterprises, the energy-saving and emission-reduction development plan of thermal engineering, etc. can be specific to a certain industry or a large-scale implementation project, and provide different reference perspectives for the future energy-saving and emission-reduction overall planning [17,18].The oil and gas storage and transportation production management system should focus on improving the service quality and efficiency of the enterprise, and take the structural reform of the supply side of the enterprise as the main line.

Design of Management Information System for Oil and Gas Storage and TransportationOil and gas storage and transportation companies generally have multiple pipelines, multiple crude oil station depots, and multiple gas stations. The business is the \"receiving, storage, transportation, and sales of crude oil and natural gas,\" the unified command of the production dispatching room, and the coordination of various stations and other related departments according to the requirements of the higher-level departments. Ensure the normal operation of production during this business process.According to the production and management needs of storage and transportation companies, we should focus on the characteristics of the oil and gas field enterprises in the development, and combine the characteristics of the industry management of the oil and gas field enterprises when focusing on versatility, and use information sharing and network dynamics in response to the defects of the existing systems.

"oil and gas field enterprises when focusing on versatility, and use information sharing and network dynamics in response to the defects of the existing systems. The technical route of management, in accordance with comprehensive management requirements, formulate a reasonable information management process, only in this way can it cater to the current development trend of storage and transportation, and in a practical sense, it can satisfy the effective control, management, and analysis of storage and transportation production [21,22].In the oil and gas storage, and transportation production management information system of this article, it is a visual auxiliary decision-making system for production management.

Database DesignThe database design establishes a table space and an index table space for the database, which is of great benefit to the management and expansion of the database, and also helps to improve the data efficiency, so as to minimize the possibility of data damage and enhance the manageability of the database. The establishment of a database is the basis and prerequisite for the development of a management information system. Then, before the development of the oil and gas storage and transportation production management information system, a unified format of the oil and gas storage and transportation production database is first required. The entire database includes geographic data, pipeline data, and safety and reliability.

Both databases will eventually be integrated into the main service system to break the barriers between data and achieve unified scheduling. For the spatial database, it mainly collects important geographic location information such as gas stations, pipeline routes, and oil stations. On the GIS system, two-dimensional geographic information data is established with north, south, east, and west asx,y. For pipeline laying simulation, three-dimensional geographic data will be established with the buried depth asz. In the attribute database, it is mainly to define the company's business, worker scheduling and other attributes, and compile attribute data into the database to achieve the purpose of data analysis, modeling, and scheduling.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.2. Functional FrameworkThis system is a comprehensive information system that integrates data collection, sorting, transmission, reporting, and publishing. The system uses B/S mode to access the database for data collection and processing.

"The physical model of this system is designed based on the data processing center of the oil and gas storage and transportation company as the main database. The oilfield network of each grassroots station and the team is connected to the server. The client of the grassroots station and team connects to the central database through the application server. The grassroots station team can only access the data of the unit, and cannot access the data of the main database of the oil and gas storage and transportation company, which logically ensures the safety of the data, and at the same time enables the centralized management of the data to improve the utilization rate of the data. According to the requirement analysis of the system, combined with the characteristics of the GIS system and the Internet of Things, we divide the functions of the software system into three blocks: (1) pipeline construction; (2) production scheduling simulation; and (3) data analysis and processing, as shown in the Figure5:Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs shown in Figure5, the main functions of the system are divided into three parts.

Pipeline Modeling3.3.1. Mathematical Model of Oil and Gas Pipeline SimulationIn the study of oil and gas, the transportation of oil and gas is one of the most critical steps. The simulation of the pipeline model is the basis of the system's path planning.

System Effect Analysis4.1. Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation Production Effect InspectionFirst, calculate the distance of oil and gas transportation. We randomly selected two oil and gas stations on the GIS system and let the system simulate pipeline construction. In order to test the effect of the system, we selected 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 50 km on the map, and 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 100 km on the map. Select 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 200 km on the map, and select 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 400 km on the map to test the algorithm respectively. The selected distance is divided by referring to the distance between most oil and gas stations on the map."

In the short-distance pipeline laying of 50 km, the simulation effect of 9 out of 10 times is better. The effect reached 90%; in the 100 km pipeline laying, the optimization effect reached 100%, and the results of 10 simulations were shorter than the original laying path. In the pipeline laying of 200 km, the optimization effect is 60%, six simulation results are shorter than the original path, two simulation results are equivalent to the original path, and two simulation results are longer than the original algorithm.

"than the original path, two simulation results are equivalent to the original path, and two simulation results are longer than the original algorithm. In the 400 km pipeline laying simulation, the optimization effect was also 90%, and once again it was similar to the original path. Therefore, the system has a relatively good effect on path optimization, but the effect is not particularly good in the simulation of 200 km mid-distance pipeline transportation.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFriction analysis is drag reduction analysis. For oil pipelines, too much resistance will result in a great decrease in oil delivery. There are also many studies on friction analysis-related literature. Generally, it is believed that the relationship between oil delivery and resistance is shown in the figure:In Figure8,Hrepresents the resistance andQrepresents the maximum oil delivery. It can be found that when the pressure of the oil transfer pump is constant, the smaller the resistance, the greater the maximum oil transfer volume. Because the resistance is impossible to eliminate, at H1, the maximum oil delivery and the resistance value reach a balanced state. At this time, the resistance is also more difficult to drop, and the drop in resistance has a small impact on the oil delivery. Therefore, we hope that the simulated frictional resistance of the pipeline can be closer to H1. In actual operation, the resistance of oil pipelines is generally fixed, and we can reduce the resistance by"

LoadRunner TestCarry out a LoadRunner test on the system, and test the performance of the system under high intensity by simulating multiple users online at the same time through LoadRunner. The test results are as follows:As shown in Figure10, LoadRunner is used to simulate 50 people online at the same time, and the response time of each person in the system is recorded separately. It can be seen that the response time of 50 people is between 4 s and 5 s, which conforms to a stable time series. The response time of the system is considered to be relatively stable, the lowest response time is 4 s, the highest is 5 s, and the difference is 1 s. In the actual situation, the average user's stay time will not exceed 5 s. If it exceeds 5 s, most users will choose to leave. It can be found that the system in this article is in line with actual usage requirements. Then analyze the performance of the system.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn order to test the maximum performance of the system, LoadRunner is used to"

Then analyze the performance of the system.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn order to test the maximum performance of the system, LoadRunner is used to simulate the number of people online from 1 to 100 at the same time. Each simulation is performed 10 times and the average value is the response time of the number of people online at the same time. As shown in Figure11, with the increase in the number of people, the response time is also at the right price, and the overall rise is stepped up. What can be found is that when the number of people at the same time reaches more than 80 people, the response time exceeds 5 s. At this time, the user experience is very bad. When the number of people online at the same time reaches 95 people, the response time soars to more than 9 s, and the user experience for the level card is now almost unusable. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous online users of the system is best controlled within 80 people, and the system is still acceptable when there are less than 95 people. The performance is stuck and the maximum number cannot exceed 95 people.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint5. ConclusionsThe 21st century is an era of the knowledge economy and information society.

"AbstractThe management information system is a kind of information-based, people-oriented, and socialized service as its purpose. It adopts advanced technology to realize the management of teachers, students, and other related personnel while effectively improving the quality of teaching. This article first analyzes the overview of data mining technology. Secondly, it analyzes the related algorithms of association rules. Finally, this article introduces the demand analysis of the university teaching quality evaluation system based on the scientific calculation of association rules. According to the demand analysis results, the system module and the corresponding submodule function modules are determined, and finally, the system architecture model is designed. Experimental results show that this model is useful for providing the effectiveness of information management.1. IntroductionWith the innovation of decision-making science and the development of modern management theory, scientific calculation based on association rule mining is gradually introduced into the application of management evaluation in universities. This makes the working methods of university administrators gradually change from traditional empirical management methods to modern management theories and methods. This change has made university administrators more creative. The traditional empirical management method only one-sidedly emphasized the particularity of education, while ignoring the commonality"
"methods to modern management theories and methods. This change has made university administrators more creative. The traditional empirical management method only one-sidedly emphasized the particularity of education, while ignoring the commonality between public management and education management. It focuses its work on management methods based on experience. The scientific management method allows managers to combine their own experience with scientific methods to improve the management of universities.2. Overview of Data Mining2.1. Data Mining DefinitionAt present, data mining technology is widely used in various fields. This technology can effectively extract the data needed by enterprises from the market, and it can form a data set of these data. The data set can be structured or unstructured, and the corresponding results can be obtained by processing and analyzing these data sets. Of course, when universities use this technology to mine data in the market, they will not only mine related data for one field or industry. They generally involve many different regions, and the fusion of these regional data is the intersection of these different regions. The relationship between data mining and other disciplines is shown in Figure1[1].Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.2. Functions of Data MiningThe task of data mining is to find hidden and meaningful information and knowledge from the database. In terms of its functions, it is generally divided into the following"
"is shown in Figure1[1].Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.2. Functions of Data MiningThe task of data mining is to find hidden and meaningful information and knowledge from the database. In terms of its functions, it is generally divided into the following categories:2.2.1. Concept DescriptionThe purpose of concept description is to briefly and comprehensively describe the data in the database. Statistics as we know is actually one of the simplest conceptual descriptions. They use data volume, mean value, square difference, or online analytical processing technology (OLAP) to perform multidimensional analysis and query operations on data, and use histograms, line graphs, and other intuitive ways to display [2,3].2.2.2. Correlation AnalysisThe core meaning of correlation analysis is to compare and correlate data obtained in different fields and then obtain a high-quality result by looking for the connection between the data. With the continuous update and expansion of the database, the content of its management and analysis has become more and more extensive, and the fields involved have become more and more extensive, which makes the database attract the attention of people from all walks of life. Association analysis finds eye-catching associations and connections with a large number of business transaction databases, so that users can make business predictions and decision-making. The main methods of association analysis are the classic Apriori algorithm and FP tree growth"
"eye-catching associations and connections with a large number of business transaction databases, so that users can make business predictions and decision-making. The main methods of association analysis are the classic Apriori algorithm and FP tree growth algorithm.2.2.3. Classification and PredictionThe main purpose of classification is to extract important data, which can be used to predict location objects to obtain conceptual models, and relevant personnel will classify these conceptual models obtained from data information. When the predicted value of a data value is missing or unexpected, it is usually called a prediction. There are many applications for classification and prediction.2.2.4. Cluster AnalysisThe object of cluster analysis is data. The main idea is to analyze the original data. The original data refers to the data without descriptive information and the data without any classification mode. After that, the data is divided into different types of structures. Contrary to classification, clustering is to classify data objects without prior knowledge, which is convenient for stratifying survey information and grouping events with similar information together [4].2.2.5. Outlier AnalysisSome data objects in the database may not follow the behavior or pattern of the compiled data. These data objects are called outliers. In order to reduce the impact of these anomalies, many mining algorithms isolate them. However, these individual sections are not always useful"
"database may not follow the behavior or pattern of the compiled data. These data objects are called outliers. In order to reduce the impact of these anomalies, many mining algorithms isolate them. However, these individual sections are not always useful and sometimes contain important information. For example, when fraud is detected, anomalies usually indicate that fraud is more likely and more likely to stimulate our interest [5].3. The Process of Data MiningData mining refers to the processing and analysis of database instances and the establishment of data patterns or functions to describe the characteristics and relationships between data. The process of data mining is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4. Methods of Data Mining4.1. Neural Network AlgorithmThe research of artificial neurons comes from the theory of brain neurons. It is recognized that the complex nervous system is composed of a large number of neurons, thus forming a complex organization structure. If the human body feels an external stimulus, it will immediately respond accordingly. For example, if a person's hand is accidentally punctured by a needle, he will shrink his hand unconsciously. The working process of the neural network is quite complicated and transparent to the user. The user can only see the input and output and cannot see the process of transferring information between neurons. A neural network method is a data mining algorithm that simulates the human nervous system"
"is quite complicated and transparent to the user. The user can only see the input and output and cannot see the process of transferring information between neurons. A neural network method is a data mining algorithm that simulates the human nervous system [6].4.2. Genetic AlgorithmA genetic algorithm is an algorithm based on biological genetic variation theory to model the biological evolution process. The idea of the algorithm is to first identify the research object, initialize the population and encode the object, then randomly generate multiple intersections and mutation points with a small probability to generate new individuals, and add new individuals to the original population. When the new ontology breeds the next generation, look for a population with high adaptability. The adaptability can be calculated by an adaptability function, which must be determined according to specific research questions [7].4.3. Decision Tree MethodIn essence, a decision tree classifies data through some rules and completes the screening of information through such a process. It can better block data and has strong applicability. This article uses the decision tree method to evaluate the management of colleges and universities; the following is a detailed elaboration.It can be known from Shannon's information theory that the amount of informationI(ai) of an eventaiwith a probability ofp(ai) can be calculated as shown in(1)Ifa1,a2,a3, ⋯,an, fornmutually incompatible events, there is only"

But different values correspond to different units, usually 2 can be taken, and the following conditions are specified; whenp(a) = 0, formula (3) is obtained:(3)The decision tree is now defined in more detail. Assuming that the set sample isS, ∣S∣ is the number of selected training samples; ∣S∣ can be divided intoC1,C2,C3, ⋯,Cndifferent categories. Among them |C1| , ∣C2| , ∣C3∣, ⋯, ∣Cn∣ represents the number of elements of the class [8]. In this way, the probability of belonging toCiin the setsis shown in(4)(5)The information gain of attributeAon setSis represented by Gain(S,A), as shown in(6)If there is no single evaluation object, an evaluation matrixMneeds to be established, and these variables need to be normalized. The matrix is represented by the following equation:(7)The optimal value and the worst value are determined by(8)(9)d+ (i) is the difference between the evaluation value and the best point, andd− (i) is the difference between the evaluation value and the worst point; then formulas (10) and (11) are obtained:(10)(11)Through the"

This paper uses the consistency test method,Drepresents the comparison matrix between the evaluation value and the test value,dikrepresents the evaluation value, anddkjrepresents the test value and is calculated with(13)(14)The classification using the decision tree method is divided into two stages: the purpose of the first stage is to obtain the corresponding knowledge and results from the obtained data. The main content is to use the data in the training set to build a decision tree and create a decision tree model. The second step is to use the generated decision tree model to classify unknown data samples. The data samples are sorted from the root node of the decision tree, branching down at a time, until a certain leaf point is reached. At this time, the class represented by the leaf point is the object class.The main content of the decision tree method is to build a high-precision, small-scale decision tree. The construction of the decision tree can be completed in two stages. The first step is to build a decision tree: this step"
"point is the object class.The main content of the decision tree method is to build a high-precision, small-scale decision tree. The construction of the decision tree can be completed in two stages. The first step is to build a decision tree: this step is the process of building a decision tree by obtaining data from the sample set. Generally speaking, the practical sample data set has a certain general level, which is suitable for the data set of historical and practical needs. The second stage is the pruning of the decision tree: this stage is mainly carried out by modifying the decision tree that survived the previous stage. It checks the preliminary rules that appeared during the tree formation process and prunes branches that affect the accuracy. This can reduce the impact of noise data on classification accuracy.The decision tree method can classify data to complete data screening. This classification process is more important. But this method has drawbacks when processing data sets. When dealing with the binary classification problem of the tree in the model solution, it is necessary to calculate the Gini index of all possible values of each possible dimension and then lay a layer of binary tree at the depth or leaf point of the tree. The binary solution tree created at this time can better classify the data. However, when the data scale is large, creating a solution tree containing all values in each dimension of all templates requires time and computing resources."
"point of the tree. The binary solution tree created at this time can better classify the data. However, when the data scale is large, creating a solution tree containing all values in each dimension of all templates requires time and computing resources. Researchers proposed a solution tree acceleration algorithm model based on eigenvalue interval division, which can be used to classify large-scale data sets.This article classifies decision tree methods into data mining methods. Decision tree methods are not only a data classification method but also a data mining method. The decision tree method can be applied to the teaching system, because the decision number method can remove useless information from a large amount of data and extract useful information. After this is applied to the teaching system, the system can delete useful learning websites for students and filter out vulgar websites.The decision tree method is based on the \"tree\" as the method model, and the construction of the decision tree can be divided into two stages. The first step is to create a decision tree: the process of creating a decision tree can be described from a set of training instructions. Generally speaking, the training sample data set is a historical and comprehensive data set used to analyze and process data according to actual needs. The second step is to prune the decision tree: pruning the decision tree is the process of analyzing and changing the decision tree created in the previous"
