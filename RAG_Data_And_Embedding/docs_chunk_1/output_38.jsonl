"technology integration yields higher productivity. In addition, they find that given more general IS is the basis for interoperability, then IS should be developed first in the order of integration. The lesson for MOT is that developing and implementing the technology that is the basis for interoperability - IS - is the key to integrating multiple technologies.3.5.1 Future OpportunitiesAlthough health care has specific characteristics such as different domains of expertise that coexist within an organization or network of organizations, the knowledge economy we face has similar characteristics. Moreover, health care is increasingly information-rich as new tests and devices all provide data, and these data are being increasingly used to dynamically treat patients. Important research in MOT is to understand sources of resistance and success of health IT implementations and integration including remote access to medical care, with likely similar patterns in knowledge-based industries.There is also important potential MOT research in bringing IT that embeds OM techniques to health care. An example is operating room scheduling where the most prevalent model is to schedule operating room blocks (part of a day) to surgeons 6-12 months ahead, and then assign patients to an operating room slate 1-2 weeks ahead. Adaptive control of the operating room slate is usually done manually, where methods like bin packing implemented in an IT-based scheduler could substantially improve patient"
"ahead, and then assign patients to an operating room slate 1-2 weeks ahead. Adaptive control of the operating room slate is usually done manually, where methods like bin packing implemented in an IT-based scheduler could substantially improve patient throughput. Another example is the use of analytics with large datasets, optimizers, and genome sequences that evaluate huge numbers of permutations of gene-based solutions to identify the most promising avenues for future medical research.4 Vertical Relations: Emergent Theme 2The issues of IT and vertical integration/disintegration, the optimal number of suppliers, organization design, and coordination through interorganizational systems (IOS) began a substantial area of research in the first decade of the econ of IS. For example, Gurbaxani and Whang (1991) describe the potential effects of IT on organizations and markets; Riggins et al. (1994), and Wang and Seidmann (1995) show the role of network externalities in IOS and how this impacts the number of suppliers; Anand and Mendelson (1997), and Nault (1998) show how IT impacts the design of two-tier organizations. These and many other subsequent studies began a literature on how IT changes vertical relations.4.1 IntegrationIntegrating different operations often involves contracts, and the choice between contract types can have a large effect.

"different operations often involves contracts, and the choice between contract types can have a large effect. Bhattacharya et al. (2014) examine contracts between clients and support centers when product improvements reduce the need for support center services. The issue for the client is that they still require investment and effort on the part of support centers, and these investments are often non-contractible as they are unobservable. The model shows that the gain-share contracts where the client shares the gains from product improvements can motivate support centers and attain second-best, whereas cost-plus contracts are not optimal. The implication for MOT is that properly designed contracts allow clients to manage product improvements when also using outside suppliers that are affected by those improvements.Sankaranarayanan and Sundararajan (2010) study the impact of different types of IOSs used for search in procurement to determine the vertical scope of enterprises - should the procurement function stay in house or be outsourced. IOS are either information-intensive (i.e., collecting published information and prior records such as posted and historical prices) or communication-intensive (e.g., collective-specific buyer information requiring active communication with those associated with the buyer such as feedback and references), and there is moral hazard with outsourcing. They find that constant (block) reductions in search costs from IT improvements result in"
"buyer information requiring active communication with those associated with the buyer such as feedback and references), and there is moral hazard with outsourcing. They find that constant (block) reductions in search costs from IT improvements result in greater outsourcing when search is information-intensive, and less outsourcing when search is communication-intensive. From the perspective of MOT, common technology platforms that integrate procurement can reduce in-house search costs and favor insourcing.Yao and Zhu (2012) address how to manage the bullwhip effect in supply chains. Using industry data, they find that for buyers electronic linkages upstream in the supply chain reduce the bullwhip effect, while for suppliers electronic linkages with buyers increase the bullwhip effect. They also find that this latter effect can be moderated with IT in the form of better information sharing and coordination. The MOT conclusion is that IT can be used to manage the bullwhip effect coming from downstream partners.4.1.1 Future OpportunitiesIssues about IT-based integration revolve around two connected aspects. First is vertical integration and the avoidance of double marginalization (Spengler1950). The pricing efficiency of vertical integration depends on the absence of competition whereas with competition the most efficient result can be vertical separation. The MOT question in this aspect of integration is to address how IT can create differentiation leading to a different"
"vertical integration depends on the absence of competition whereas with competition the most efficient result can be vertical separation. The MOT question in this aspect of integration is to address how IT can create differentiation leading to a different balance of vertical integration and separation.The second IT-based integration issue is transaction costs with the threat of opportunism, bounded rationality leading to incomplete contracts, and hold-up from asset specificity. The research opportunity in MOT here is recognizing that IT supports virtual vertical integration based on information sharing, where virtual implies a range of temporal vertical integrated relationships from individual transactions (e.g., purchases from a retailer online through Amazon) to long-term investments in IOS. Understanding how different levels of information sharing investments and the incentives they create impact virtual vertical integration is an interesting area of future work.Finally, there is a longer-term question of whether IT has changed the structure of industry - that is, have investments in IT changed which industries transact and the volume of transactions between industries. Examining this trend would help us understand the long-term effects of the IT revolution described in the Introduction.4.2 IT AdoptionNew IT arises constantly.

"the long-term effects of the IT revolution described in the Introduction.4.2 IT AdoptionNew IT arises constantly. Understanding the factors that affect the adoption of these new technologies, such as cost and acceptance, is critical to successful implementation. In addition to IOS that affect multiple tiers in an organization or supply chain, there are also new tracking technologies such as RFID. Whang (2010) examines the adoption of RFID in a two-firm supply chain: when does the upstream firm adopt, and does the downstream firm free ride? As a typical IT, RFID adoption costs fall over time, and a supply chain typically adopts later than a vertically integrated firm as costs are borne by the first adopting tier. In this case, cost sharing can lead to earlier adoption, and the implication for MOT is that coordination in adoption through revenue or cost sharing is needed to adopt IT that has effects along the supply chain.Continuing with RFID, Camdereli and Swaminathan (2010) study the impact of RFID on misplaced inventory in a two-tier supply chain where the variable cost of RFID is assigned to one of the tiers. They consider a supply chain that is vertically integrated, decentralized or coordinated with contracts. Using numerical analysis they find that both decentralized and coordinated supply chains result in higher wholesale prices. From the perspective of MOT, how IT is implemented and charged across the supply chain can result in higher wholesale prices, and this is"
"numerical analysis they find that both decentralized and coordinated supply chains result in higher wholesale prices. From the perspective of MOT, how IT is implemented and charged across the supply chain can result in higher wholesale prices, and this is likely to result in higher retail prices and double marginalization.4.2.1 Future OpportunitiesRFID is not only a typical IT in terms of costs, but also in terms of privacy issues and the role of standards. Many IT innovations in the coming years are related to mobile computing and tracking of consumers by firms, and between firms along the supply chain. Studies that examine privacy and the role of standards in the adoption of IT, including firms' strategies, the ability to opt-in or opt-out, and possible regulation constitutes a wide range of possible MOT research.4.3 IntermediationIntermediation by automated agents or IOS-based exchanges, or disintermediation by changing channels of distribution to go directly to customers such as direct sales through the Internet continues to be a fruitful area of research that spans multiple disciplines. In a recent article, Hsiao and Chen (2014) examine when a manufacturer should use its own Internet channel vs. a retailer when customers differ to the degree they are physical channel shoppers (retail stores) vs. Internet (online) shoppers. In their model either the manufacturer or the retailer can use an Internet channel. They find that with multiple retailers the manufacturer can"
"differ to the degree they are physical channel shoppers (retail stores) vs. Internet (online) shoppers. In their model either the manufacturer or the retailer can use an Internet channel. They find that with multiple retailers the manufacturer can leverage retail competition and not use its Internet channel, while maintaining the threat of using its Internet channel. The implication for MOT is how IT, typically through the Internet, can affect channel choice and configuration4.3.1 Future OpportunitiesThere are two particularly promising and related directions for MOT research on IT and intermediation. The first is horizontal integration over one tier in the supply chain. An example is one used above - Amazon as an Internet retail intermediary between retailers and customers. The question is whether this type of horizontal integration is feasible at other tiers in the supply chain.The second is how IT-based platforms may facilitate the sharing economy. Firms such as Airbnb and Uber have done this in the travel retail space. The industrial opportunity is for firms to use the sharing economy for assets such as plant capacity or specialized equipment in a two-sided platform-mediated network, where investments are required for both the sharing platform and the side that owns the assets.In the next section, we focus on platforms and point to some areas where platform-related research can be fruitful.5 Platforms: Emergent Theme 3IT-based platforms are becoming increasingly"
"for both the sharing platform and the side that owns the assets.In the next section, we focus on platforms and point to some areas where platform-related research can be fruitful.5 Platforms: Emergent Theme 3IT-based platforms are becoming increasingly prevalent. Platforms are systems made up of multiple components (Katz and Shapiro1994, Marshak1964) which are often in common or reused across implementations. According to Boudreau (2010), \"a platform may include physical components, tools and rules to facilitate development, a collection of technical standards to support interoperability, or any combination of these things. Serving as a stable nexus or foundation, a platform can organize the technical development of interchangeable, complementary components and permit them to interact with one another.\" Search and database technology, personalization technology, online communities and social networks, etc., have enabled platforms in different industries such as retail (e.g., Amazon), insurance (healthcare.gov), dating (match.com), education (Coursera), and freelancing (elance.com). Platforms are dynamic; as technology improves, they can be upgraded and extended, which has implications on firms' IT investment decisions. Platforms may also be vulnerable to replacement by rivals (Eisenmann et al.2006). For example, Blu-ray defeated rival HD DVD, and Facebook replaced MySpace as the dominant force in social media.IT-based platforms have had increasing impact on OM, from new"
"Platforms may also be vulnerable to replacement by rivals (Eisenmann et al.2006). For example, Blu-ray defeated rival HD DVD, and Facebook replaced MySpace as the dominant force in social media.IT-based platforms have had increasing impact on OM, from new product development to supply chain management and customer service: they may reduce time-to-market, improve design for manufacturability, improve product features, and reduce manufacturing costs (Gaimon et al.2017). We organize platform-related research into four subthemes presented in sequence below.5.1 Managing a Platform's CapabilitiesA platform is a system of components and rules used in common across users' transactions. Depending on the context, a platform might be used for product design, for computer software (e.g., Windows or Mac) or mobile app development (Android vs. iOS), or for networked markets (e.g., Amazon, eBay). Naturally, the rules and components might be different from platform to platform. Within the same context, the components of competing platforms might be different, yielding different application outcomes.The IS literature has looked at platforms themselves as a technology whose capability can be designed/manipulated. Anderson et al. (2014) investigates a key decision in platform design: the level of a platform's processing and graphical capabilities to invest in at each product development cycle, using the video game industry as a context. The video game industry is a typical two-sided market: on"
"a key decision in platform design: the level of a platform's processing and graphical capabilities to invest in at each product development cycle, using the video game industry as a context. The video game industry is a typical two-sided market: on one side, there are video game players who own a game console; on the other side, there are game developers who develop for a particular platform (e.g., Nintendo or PlayStation). There is a strong cross-side network effect in this kind of two-sided market: the more players that own a particular platform (console), the more developers are willing to develop games for that platform. Similarly, the more games there are available for a particular platform, the more players are willing to buy that platform. Therefore, platform creators need to carefully balance the needs on both sides of the market to attract the maximum number of players and developers. Interestingly, the authors find that a platform with lower capabilities but a wider product mix (e.g., games) might be a winning strategy in a network with cross-side effects that is content driven and highly competitive. From a MOT perspective, managing a platform's capabilities has a direct impact on a firm's product strategy and market competitiveness.Looking at a different platform capability, Ba et al. (2010) analyzes what level of e-service is optimal for a firm. Firms increasingly rely on IT platforms to deliver a variety of services: for example, tracking courier packages,"
"market competitiveness.Looking at a different platform capability, Ba et al. (2010) analyzes what level of e-service is optimal for a firm. Firms increasingly rely on IT platforms to deliver a variety of services: for example, tracking courier packages, booking tickets, scheduling car maintenance, applying for mortgage loans, after-sales support, as opposed to the human intervention needed a decade ago. Given that a firm has the option of offering services through a digital platform and/or with human assistance, what is the appropriate level of e-service capabilities the firm should provide, taking into account consumer preference, as well as the cost of providing each service? How does a firm's action affect its competitiveness in a marketplace where competitors also act strategically? The authors conclude that if the firms are not very differentiated in human service, but differ greatly in e-service, then it is not worthwhile to attempt to increase the differentiation in human service. From the perspective of MOT, their analysis suggests that, although e-service is necessary in today's business environment, firms should still try to maximally differentiate the service provided by their platforms. Managing their e-service capabilities in this way allows firms to capture different types of customers and avoid direct price competition.5.1.1 Future OpportunitiesPast research has mainly focused on the scenario where firms provide their own platforms and compete against each"
"capabilities in this way allows firms to capture different types of customers and avoid direct price competition.5.1.1 Future OpportunitiesPast research has mainly focused on the scenario where firms provide their own platforms and compete against each other with platforms that have different capabilities: video game consoles with different processing and graphical capabilities, as in the study of Anderson et al. (2014), or online service capabilities, as in Ba et al. (2010). Shared platforms have not been studied and could be a significant area for future MOT research. We use e-service as an example to illustrate this point.Empirical research has shown e-service to be a differentiator among competitors (Ba et al.2012, Rust and Oliver2000, Zeithaml et al.2002). Platform-based e-service is emerging. As an example, ShopRunner is a platform that connects retailers with shoppers. Members enjoy free 2-day shipping and free return shipping. Three forms of customer services are available on the ShopRunner platform: searching for products, order tracking, and printing of return labels - the actual purchase process is accomplished on the individual retailer's own website. More sophisticated and involved customer service still needs to be handled by individual retailers. If a platform like ShopRunner handles all e-service for member retailers, then there is no differentiation over e-service, and this might not be desirable. On the other hand, platforms like ShopRunner exhibit strong"
"to be handled by individual retailers. If a platform like ShopRunner handles all e-service for member retailers, then there is no differentiation over e-service, and this might not be desirable. On the other hand, platforms like ShopRunner exhibit strong cross-side network effects, similar to the video game consoles studied by Anderson et al. (2014), and these cross-side effects benefit participating retailers. Important research in MOT is to understand how these different forces affect retail competition. In addition, from the platform providers' perspective, can they benefit by providing compatible platforms, under what conditions do they benefit, and what is the social welfare gain (or loss) on the consumer side?5.2 Effects of Platforms on Innovation and New Product DevelopmentThe prevalence of platforms has enabled a wide variety of applications that touch upon key OM areas. For example, many companies (Google, Best Buy, HP, to name a few) use prediction markets for price forecasting, sales forecasting, or project completion estimation. Some use platforms to coordinate their supply chain activities. And yet many others use platform-based innovation markets for idea generation and evaluation.Innovation and new product development are critical to a company's competitive edge, and sometimes its survival. Traditionally, R&D and new product development activities are mostly done in-house and are often expensive. Many ideas might go through a development funnel, with most"
"development are critical to a company's competitive edge, and sometimes its survival. Traditionally, R&D and new product development activities are mostly done in-house and are often expensive. Many ideas might go through a development funnel, with most ideas winnowed out and few surviving. Sometimes a firm may not be able to find a solution within its own base of expertise. IT-based platforms have enabled a new way of generating innovative ideas and creative solutions.The OM literature shows that higher product variety may lead to higher firm performance. However, greater product variety also means lower production efficiency and greater cost in terms of production, inventory, supply chain management, etc. IT apparently lends a counter effect by lowering the cost of concept development, product design, project management, and supply chain coordination. Gao and Hitt (2012) investigate the relationship between IT and product variety, using trademarks as a measure of product variety. They find that not only does IT contribute to higher trademark holdings, but also that firms with more IT capital tend to apply for more new trademarks and retire existing trademarks more quickly, suggesting an increased rate of product introduction. In the same vein, Kleis et al. (2012) show that a 10% increase in IT input is associated with a 1.7% increase in innovation output for a given level of innovation-related spending. That is, IT is also important for improved innovation"
"introduction. In the same vein, Kleis et al. (2012) show that a 10% increase in IT input is associated with a 1.7% increase in innovation output for a given level of innovation-related spending. That is, IT is also important for improved innovation productivity.More recent development in IT platforms has enabled new ways of innovation and product ideation. Crowdsourcing is one of these new ways, and refers to taking a task once performed by an employee and outsourcing it to a large undefined group external to the company in the form of an open call (Howe2008). Crowdsourcing has become a popular way of gathering ideas for new products and services from a large, dispersed crowd of non-experts (e.g., consumers). Dell's IdeaStorm is a crowdsourcing website that launched in February 2007. The goal of this initiative was to hear what new products or services Dell's customers would like to see Dell develop: \"IdeaStorm was created to . . . allow you the customer to share ideas and collaborate with one another and Dell. Our goal through IdeaStorm is to hear what new products or services you'd like to see Dell develop.\" (see ideastorm.com) Since launching, the site has received over 16,000 ideas, nearly 500 of which Dell has implemented.Bayus (2013) and Huang et al.

"(2013) and Huang et al. (2014) both try to uncover the economic mechanisms shaping the individual behavior and ideation efforts on crowdsourcing platforms. Huang et al. (2014) finds that individuals learn rather quickly about their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas, but the learning regarding the firm's cost structure, which affects the feasibility of their ideas, is slow. Bayus (2013) concludes that serial ideators are found to be more likely than consumers with only one idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable enough to implement, but are unlikely to repeat their early success once their ideas are implemented. An interesting research question from the MOT perspective is how to design these ideation platforms to nurture individuals' ideation process.InnoCentive is a successful platform that uses crowdsourcing to generate innovative ideas. Through this platform, firms can post a problem and solicit solutions, with the winning entry receiving a cash prize. A spin-off from Eli Lilly, the creator of the platform recognized a problem that many firms had long faced: firms tended to address science problems using a limited number of scientists in a single knowledge domain, often from an in-house group, forming a local-search phenomenon. When a local search was unsuccessful, problems simply were not solved or lay dormant. Eli Lilly created the platform to connect diverse \"outside\" experts to \"inside\" problems.

"forming a local-search phenomenon. When a local search was unsuccessful, problems simply were not solved or lay dormant. Eli Lilly created the platform to connect diverse \"outside\" experts to \"inside\" problems. After the spin-off, the platform was opened up to anybody looking to have a problem solved in the areas of engineering, computer science, math, chemistry, life sciences, physical sciences, and business. Cash awards are given for the best solutions to solvers that meet the challenge criteria. Today, InnoCentive's solver community consists of over 355,000 people from nearly 200 countries.An important concern for MOT researchers is how to manage the \"crowd\" in order for innovation to continue to flourish, as the user base on this type of platform continues to grow. Economists have long noted the negative incentive effects in innovation contests - increasing the number of competitors admitted to a contest reduces the likelihood of any one competitor winning, thereby reducing incentives to exert effort and lowering overall innovation outcomes (Che and Gale2003, Fullerton and McAfee1999, Taylor1995). On the other hand, adding a greater number of competitors (thus more parallel paths) will lead to a greater chance of finding at least one good solution (Abernathy and Rosenbloom1969, Dahan and Mendelson2001). Using data from a popular crowdsourcing platform, Boudreau et al. (2011) empirically examine evidence of these two opposing forces and find that adding competitors indeed"
"at least one good solution (Abernathy and Rosenbloom1969, Dahan and Mendelson2001). Using data from a popular crowdsourcing platform, Boudreau et al. (2011) empirically examine evidence of these two opposing forces and find that adding competitors indeed worsens outcomes in expectation but increases the \"upside\" in that at least one competitor would deliver a good outcome. Their findings call for greater research into integrating and examining the interplay between the parallel path and incentive effects in innovation contests.Recognizing that although a firm can now have immediate access to an unlimited supply of labor and a wide pool of talent and skills, Acemoglu et al. (2014) state that \"extracting the good from the bad and managing this pool of workers is fraught with difficulties.\" They propose a model of crowd innovation in which a firm seeks to assign a range of innovation tasks of unknown difficulty to a set of heterogeneous workers using a virtual marketplace (i.e., a platform). Using a dynamic programming formulation, they propose a matching method when worker skills are unknown and workers choose when to participate and which tasks to work on. The implementation relies on a simple pricing scheme in which rewards for completing tasks increase the longer these tasks remain uncompleted (i.e., the more times they are unsuccessfully attempted). A noteworthy feature of this optimal matching method is its ability to economize on the scarcity in this marketplace - the"
"for completing tasks increase the longer these tasks remain uncompleted (i.e., the more times they are unsuccessfully attempted). A noteworthy feature of this optimal matching method is its ability to economize on the scarcity in this marketplace - the time of skilled workers.A question that has not been frequently asked is the interaction and dynamics between the firm seeking new ideas and the individuals providing the solutions. Lee et al. (2015) analyze an economic model of the buyer-provider knowledge outsourcing problem. Recognizing that the firm seeking knowledge may not know with certainty the amount of knowledge necessary to arrive at a good solution, they identify conditions under which both the buyer and provider benefit from uncertainty in the project deliverable. In addition, they articulate that the buyer's level of absorptive capacity, which normally is not known by the provider, may affect the provider's economic outcome.5.2.1 Future OpportunitiesBrynjolfsson et al. (2010) explores the long tail effect of IT and asks the question: how does IT affect product variety and sales concentration patterns? As platform-based crowdsourcing becomes more widespread, the same question should be asked by MOT researchers: crowdsourcing works partly because of the divergent expertise, ideas, and the out-of-the-box thinking it brings. Will crowdsourcing enable an even longer tail for product variety, and in what kind of product markets will this likely happen? Does the design"
"works partly because of the divergent expertise, ideas, and the out-of-the-box thinking it brings. Will crowdsourcing enable an even longer tail for product variety, and in what kind of product markets will this likely happen? Does the design of these technology-based crowdsourcing platforms have an impact on the potential long tail outcome, and what are the social welfare implications as more niche products are developed and delivered to consumers? Most existing research has focused on currently available crowdsourcing platforms. We believe these platforms should also be examined from a mechanism design perspective, as Acemoglu et al. (2014) have done. For example, what reputation mechanisms should be built into these crowdsourcing platforms to enable firms to efficiently sift through hundreds of thousands of potential ideators who may or may not have the ability to provide feasible solutions? Although reputation mechanisms exist on other platforms in different contexts, and have worked well in those contexts (Ba and Pavlou2002, Dellarocas2003), innovation and product development are inherently different from carrying out a sales transaction. One can conjecture a different type of reputation mechanism than the ones we are familiar with would be necessary.In addition to mechanism design, another future research topic for MOT is to examine how participants make decisions about what types of tasks to work on, and how different design incentives for crowdsourcing lead to"
"are familiar with would be necessary.In addition to mechanism design, another future research topic for MOT is to examine how participants make decisions about what types of tasks to work on, and how different design incentives for crowdsourcing lead to different innovation outcomes. There is potential for more research in this area to help us understand what characteristics of a problem lend themselves to productive use of external solvers. Of course, technological change will affect these innovation platforms, which will necessarily shape the ways that people connect to generate and evaluate ideas (Kornish and Hutchison-Krupat2017). We believe this will be a fruitful research area for years to come.5.3 Effects of Platforms on Knowledge ManagementFirms do not always need to go outside to find the necessary expertise and knowledge for new product development ideas or problem solving. Often times, the expertise and knowledge exist within the firm, but codifying them, storing them, and efficiently distributing them poses a significant challenge. The field of knowledge management in the IS discipline has existed for many years for exactly this reason. Technical systems are needed to support the knowledge workers in their effort to advance science and technology (Gaimon et al.2017). In recent years, because of the development and availability of a variety of IT platforms and the ease of access to these platforms, internal knowledge markets have appeared that facilitate"
"effort to advance science and technology (Gaimon et al.2017). In recent years, because of the development and availability of a variety of IT platforms and the ease of access to these platforms, internal knowledge markets have appeared that facilitate information sharing within large organizations. An internal knowledge market is typically an IT-supported platform that helps connect users to experts and expertise within the organization so that users can trade their knowledge via price mechanisms (Benbya and Van Alstyne2011).Different from many physical goods, knowledge goods have two distinct characteristics. First, knowledge within an organization can be considered a public good - once knowledge is created, it can be freely disseminated to or shared by various organizational units at close to zero marginal cost. Therefore, it is subject to free-riding. Individual organizational units may refuse to pay for the creation of knowledge even though they privately have a high value for the knowledge. Second, knowledge is interrelated and interdependent; that is, there is complementarity among knowledge components. The value of knowledge often derives from a bundle of knowledge components, rather than from individual components. These two characteristics present a serious challenge to allocating organizational resources for knowledge creation and knowledge dissemination. Existing internal knowledge markets such as those used by Infosys, Siemens, Bank of America, etc. treat"
"These two characteristics present a serious challenge to allocating organizational resources for knowledge creation and knowledge dissemination. Existing internal knowledge markets such as those used by Infosys, Siemens, Bank of America, etc. treat knowledge as discrete objects that can be individually priced and traded.Earlier research partially addresses this problem. Ba et al. (2001) presents a Groves-Clarke-type double auction mechanism that allows bundled knowledge goods to be traded so as to recognize complementarities between knowledge projects. Their model enables a firm to optimally select what knowledge should be chosen for investment. They argue that a centralized approach may lack the oversight and local information needed to obtain an optimal selection - an opinion echoed by Benbya and van Alstyne (2011). Moreover, without proper economic incentives, corporate entities may not have the motivation to provide the true valuation for their use of knowledge. The market mechanism designed by Ba et al. (2001) which allows the knowledge creators (sharers) to be compensated is incentive compatible and takes into account the complementary nature of the knowledge components. The implication for MOT is that although knowledge markets can facilitate knowledge sharing and creation, different knowledge market designs might lead to over- or under-investment in knowledge creation.5.3.1 Future OpportunitiesThe platforms of today are becoming increasingly powerful.

"markets can facilitate knowledge sharing and creation, different knowledge market designs might lead to over- or under-investment in knowledge creation.5.3.1 Future OpportunitiesThe platforms of today are becoming increasingly powerful. Implementing a platform-based internal knowledge market, even those that require significant computational power such as the one presented by Ba et al. (2001), is entirely feasible. MOT should not only be concerned with product development and production, but also the underlying knowledge needed for these activities. Future research, particularly experimental studies, could provide insight into how this kind of market performs compared to traditional knowledge management approaches and knowledge markets that do not allow complementarity among knowledge projects. In addition, how this market impacts the behavior of individual agents and their valuation of knowledge is an interesting question.As platforms become more prevalent, knowledge acquisition from external sources has become easily achievable. For example, within software development and system administration functions of an organization, employees can turn to external knowledge platforms such as Stack Overflow or Experts Exchange to seek technical help and solutions. A research question that is well worth exploring is the interaction between internal knowledge management mechanisms and external ones. Which ones would be more economical for an organization?

"to seek technical help and solutions. A research question that is well worth exploring is the interaction between internal knowledge management mechanisms and external ones. Which ones would be more economical for an organization? How is an organization's overall knowledge management strategy affected when employees frequently seek external knowledge solutions? How does this phenomenon affect an organization's own research and development capabilities? Erat and Krishnan (2011) articulate the importance of carefully specifying the nature of the knowledge to be acquired by the knowledge seeker, beyond considering the price charged by the provider. Opportunities exist for future research to explore the process by which the buyer identifies the attributes and scope of the knowledge needed (Kornish and Hutchison-Krupat2017). As Gaimon et al. (2017) point out, a firm's employees and knowledge management systems do not operate in isolation. We must consider how the external marketplace and the firm's internal incentives drive the success of a product development project.5.4 Effects of Platforms on Manufacturing and CustomizationThe concept of product customization has been around for a long time. It generally refers to the manufacturing practice of interacting with a client, understanding the client's preferences, and producing a product that suits the client's needs. Although appealing in theory, product customization is considered a costly process. Mass-customization, as an"
"practice of interacting with a client, understanding the client's preferences, and producing a product that suits the client's needs. Although appealing in theory, product customization is considered a costly process. Mass-customization, as an improvement, combines the flexibility and personalization of \"custom-made\" with the low unit costs associated with mass production by delivering wide-market goods and services that are modified to satisfy a specific customer need (Pine1993). However, managers have realized that mass customization, too, can lead to unnecessary cost and manufacturing complexity. Customization could also make the purchase decision difficult by making the choice task complex (Arora et al.2008).Fortunately, IT-enabled platforms have significantly reduced the communication costs between customers and manufacturers. Gu and Tayi (2015) investigate a new type of customization that relies on digitizing the customization process: consumer customization. Consumer customization differs from other forms of product customization in that product customization is carried out by firms for consumers, whereas consumer customization is done by consumers for themselves. For example, Shoes of Prey, an online retailer, let shoppers design their own shoes online using its 3D design platform.

"design their own shoes online using its 3D design platform. The shoes are then made to order and shipped to the customer at prices comparable with those available from mass-market stores. In the IT industry, offering consumer-customizable products have become common: a customer can order a computer from a manufacturer to custom-fit their preferences. Gu and Tayi (2015) explore the benefits for a firm offering a consumer-customizable product and the strategic implications on consumer surplus. They find that it is more profitable for a monopolist to offer a consumer-customizable product than to offer a standardized product if the overall customizing capability of the consumer market is sufficiently high. Otherwise, offering a standardized product is more profitable. From an MOT perspective, their findings have important implications for when a firm should incorporate consumer customization into their production process and what factors lead to that decision.5.4.1 Future OpportunitiesAlthough consumer customization is not yet widespread, it is catching on. Project Ara from Google, still in the development stage, enables users to create a modular smartphone that is precisely tailored to their functional and esthetic preferences. A consumer-customized smartphone would give users the ability to choose hardware components to fit their needs - a camera, battery, or an oximeter that measures pulse rates and blood oxygen levels - just as they choose apps.

"A consumer-customized smartphone would give users the ability to choose hardware components to fit their needs - a camera, battery, or an oximeter that measures pulse rates and blood oxygen levels - just as they choose apps. IT-based platforms have made this kind of consumer customization possible and accessible, even if not immediately. Some forward-thinking MOT research questions to ask are as follows: what are the implications of consumer customization on manufacturing? How would traditional inventory management and supply chain management practice be impacted? Moreover, how should firms price their customized products? How is social welfare and consumer surplus affected when a firm adopts the consumer customization practice? When do firms benefit from adopting customization technologies, and what are the long-term impacts and profitability of consumer customization?6 ConclusionsIn developing our emergent themes and subthemes, we explicitly recognize that research is best constructed as a cumulative tradition where future opportunities build on previous research. Even great historical paradigm shifts such as Einstein's special relativity in theoretical physics was driven from the negative results of the Michelson-Morely experiments on the aether theory and subsequent work by Lorentz and Poincare.Although slightly less ambitious, our outlining of future opportunities for each of our emergent subthemes point to potentially important research on MOT from the econ of IS"
"experiments on the aether theory and subsequent work by Lorentz and Poincare.Although slightly less ambitious, our outlining of future opportunities for each of our emergent subthemes point to potentially important research on MOT from the econ of IS viewpoint. Of course, our themes and subthemes are subsets of a wide range of possible future directions for econ of IS-based research in MOT. We stayed away from recommendations about any particular new IT as the underlying technology changes so rapidly. However, as seen by the studies on RFID, it is sometimes possible to get more broadly applicable results from studying a specific technology. Our themes and subthemes are designed to be concepts that not only apply to existing IT, but also to future unforeseen technologies.There are some common threads that run through the future opportunities in some of our subthemes. Coordination plays a role in the impact of IT spillovers, and is also a subtheme in directly generating effects of IT on TFP. Furthermore, coordination plays a subtle role in the effects of platforms on knowledge management complementarities, and in both horizontal integration and IT-based platforms supporting a sharing economy. Integration and intermediation from vertical relations both play an explicit role in productivity spillovers and in sustainability, and all subthemes from vertical relations play an implicit role in substitution and coordination.The most obvious common thread is that between platforms and"
"vertical relations both play an explicit role in productivity spillovers and in sustainability, and all subthemes from vertical relations play an implicit role in substitution and coordination.The most obvious common thread is that between platforms and our other themes. Platform capabilities and their effects on knowledge, new product development and on manufacturing have the potential to impact all of the subthemes described under productivity and vertical relations. Indeed, even as we consider the MOT implications of platforms and the associated research questions, platforms continue to evolve. Mobile platforms are playing an ever-greater role in how consumers interact with firms, with products, and with each other. More traditional IT-based platforms might even be replaced by newer technologies such as virtual reality before too long. As Mark Zuckerberg recently stated: \"We believe virtual reality will be the next major platform. VR is such an immersive experience, and one day it will enable everyone to create, share and experience anything.\" (FB posting, September 24, 2015). Although most VR experiences today are from gaming content, other content will surely emerge as the platform matures, even though the forms of which we cannot yet anticipate (Chan2015). These newer platforms will continue to challenge our existing business practice, and most certainly will affect how we think about innovation, product development and customization, as well as how these can be used"
"we cannot yet anticipate (Chan2015).

"AbstractWhen several adjacent foundation pits are excavated simultaneously and alternately, the foundation pit group has the interactions which will aggravate the excavation-induced adverse impact on surrounding environment. However, due to the massive construction information and monitoring data during excavation, the effect of interactions on performance of the foundation pits is hardly examined. In this study, a digital system is developed to manage the construction information and monitoring data of the foundation pit group. On the one hand, a visualization management system based on Autodesk Revit is developed to record information such as geometry information, excavation stages, and instrument layout. The complex construction information can be inquired dynamically. On the other hand, a dynamic and synchronous analysis system is developed based on SQL Server external database, Visio, and Excel software. The SQL Server software is capable to facilitate data classification and standardization management. The excavation process and monitoring data are fused through the secondary development of Visio and Excel software to help visualize, respectively. The developed system is applied to the foundation pit group of Shanghai World Expo Project.

"World Expo Project. The lateral deflection of diaphragm walls is investigated and the rebound phenomenon of diaphragm wall is interpreted. It confirms that the developed system can improve the information management so that the deformation behavior of the foundation pit group can be analyzed efficiently.1. IntroductionWith the acceleration of urbanization, the underground space exploitation tends to be larger and more intensive. Consequently, a large number of deep excavations have been carried out in the last two decades. When several adjacent foundation pits are excavated simultaneously and alternately, called foundation pit group, these foundation pits have the interactions, which will aggravate the excavation-induced adverse impact on surrounding environment. The interaction is a crucial factor that causes abnormal performance and increases construction risks [1,2]. The traditional management system of foundation pit mainly included BIM-based information system and other digital technologies which can act as effective communication tools, visualization, and data analysis in an integrated environment. Li and Shu developed a web-based information system for information management, visualizing, and data analyzing for shield tunnel construction [3].

"tunnel construction [3]. Akanmu et al. developed an automated site layout modeling system using a combination of autonomous technologies. The proposed system relied on a platform and computational algorithms for database establishment and data analysis [4]. Lee et al. proposed a construction information database system based on BIM technology to enable the comprehensive management of information during construction progress [5]. Rodrigues et al. introduced a comprehensive management system in which the case study was modelled in Autodesk Revit software and a support database was developed in Microsoft SQL Server, and a web application was developed to implement the depiction and consultation of 3D model, parametric data, and construction information [6]. Lee et al. proposed a risk management system to monitor and evaluate the risk based on optimized grey Verhulst model, BIM-3DGIS framework, and risk monitoring.

"to inefficient management of massive data. The main difference between the proposed system and traditional construction risk monitoring systems is listed in Table1. Specially, as the interaction of adjacent excavation is more reflected in local time and space in the foundation pit group, the modeling of excavation condition must be refined to the scale of local block excavation. Therefore, the research target of the proposed system is the interaction analysis in local time and space due to superposition effect of multiple block and partition excavation. The comparison is made from four aspects of modeling object, research target, data management, and data analysis.Table  1.The difference between proposed system and common risk monitoring systems.Common systemProposed systemModeling objectSingle foundation pit with series of excavation stagesInformation management of multiple excavation in foundation pit groupResearch targetAnalysis of stress and deformation characteristics during excavation from overall foundation pitInteraction analysis in local time and space due to the superposition effect of multiple block and partition excavationData managementArticulating data directly in traditional Revit model filesBeing more lightweight and compatible through digital-analog separationData analysisAnalysis of the monitoring data without the combination of excavation informationCarrying out the statistical analysis and dynamic management of abstract data in combination with the actual"

In this paper, a functional integration system was developed to implement the recording, visualization, and data analysis of construction progress which was then applied to a case study. The methodology adopted to be applied to the case study follows the following steps:(1)VSCM: the foundation pit group was modelled with the Autodesk Revit software.

There is a lack of functional integration system which can implement data storage, visualization, coupling analysis, and risk assessment synchronously. Most systems seldom attribute to manage several excavations information and analyze the mutual influence, which will aggravate the excavation-induced adverse impact on surrounding environment in a foundation pit group.3.

VSCMThis section puts forward the comprehensive management platform to record construction and monitoring information based on Autodesk Revit software, named as \"Visualization System for Foundation Pit Construction Information and Monitoring Data\" (VSCM for short). The three-dimensional display of excavation process was carried out against elapsed time. Meanwhile, the foundation pit measuring points and monitoring data were stored and dynamically inquired in Revit software. It consists of three modules: excavation, monitoring, and construction information, which are used for excavation information management, monitoring data management, and dynamic query of construction information, respectively.

"soil modeling. Both of them are generated and numbered by each soil element; therefore, the excavation process can be displayed by the removal of excavated soil elements. For any soil element, there are four states shown in the model with different forms in Revit software. Meanwhile, the precision recording of excavation information was carried out through smoothing approximation method in Revit, which solved the problem of precision recording during excavation. Finally, the precision recording of excavation information can be used to inquire the excavation process of the entire project dynamically with the combination of time information. Table2lists the displayed styles for soil regions in different excavation stages.Table  2.Displayed styles for soil regions in different excavation stages.Excavation stagesDisplay style for soil regions in RevitNot excavatedCompletely opaque, grey surfaceBeing excavated50% transparency, red surfaceCompletedCompletely transparentUnclear30% transparency, green surfaceThe monitoring information includes monitoring items, instruments layout, and field data. In order to facilitate the management of monitoring data, the storage, query, modification, and real-time addition can be achieved by means of Microsoft SQL Server external database.

Further, the VSCM provides the corresponding import and export functions of field data from Revit to Excel data sheet.Generally, VSCM is applied to inquire the full information of complex excavation stages and monitoring data in a foundation pit group, so it is very convenient for decision-makers to query the current state.3.3. Database EstablishmentA database is the basis of dynamic and synchronous analysis in a foundation pit group. The corresponding tools were developed to extract table data in Excel and Word directly, and then the extracted data were converted into standard formats automatically. According to relevant classification and organization principle, the data in the whole foundation pit group are stored in the SQL Server database. The database in the construction process can be divided into engineering information, construction information, and monitoring information. Engineering information refers to the characteristic parameters, such as excavation area, depth, location, and adjacent structures. Construction information refers to the current construction progress, such as the location of block excavation, current excavation depth, and inner support system. Monitoring information refers to the coordinate of measured points and monitoring data, such as the spatial location of inclinometer casings and level instrument.Revit software is used to record \"construction information\" and \"monitoring data,\" which are then"

A clear structural relationship between construction information and monitoring data is established (Figure3). This method provides a convenient approach to inquire and fuse both information according to the time node. The monitoring time, completion time, installation time, and removal time are all critical time nodes, which collectively constitute the benchmark for synchronous analysis during excavation.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointExcavation project database relationship diagram.3.4. Visual ModelingVisualization is an essential technology in the management system, which is used to convert excavation stages and monitoring data into images through the developed plug-ins of Visio and Excel software, respectively.3.4.1. Curve Modeling of Monitoring DataA large amount of monitoring data which represent the excavation behaviors have been collected.

"column vertical movements, and support stresses. It is unavailable to observe the features of monitoring data in the form of numbers or tables. Therefore, data from all monitoring items are extracted to draw corresponding dynamic curves against elapsed time.However, excavation behaviors are affected by various and complex factors such as soil conditions, excavation methods, support system, and pit geometrics, which makes the massive field data difficult to process. Firstly, the system provides operation interface to draw curves of single monitoring item. By investigating the generated curves, the distribution and trends of single excavation behavior are obtained [25-27]. Secondly, many literatures suggested that an experiential relationship existed between behaviors and potential geometric of the foundation pit, called data normalization processing. Several coupling relationships, between (1) the measured maximum wall deflection and excavation depth, (2) the depth where maximum wall deflection occurred and excavation depth, (3) the maximum wall deflection and the corresponding maximum ground settlement, and (4) the steel support stress and compression, are available in correlational studies [28,29]. The system is also capable to provide the operation interface to draw curves of multiple monitoring items based on the corresponding relationship.3.4.2.

"to provide the operation interface to draw curves of multiple monitoring items based on the corresponding relationship.3.4.2. State Modeling of Excavation StagesTwo-dimensional modeling through Visio tool was developed to implement the visualization and dynamic query of each excavation stage. The effects of adjacent excavations on behaviors of foundation pit are currently reflected in local temporal and spatial aspects. Therefore, the state modeling of excavation stages should be refined to the scale of partition and block, which is beneficial to restore the whole dynamic process for subsequent analysis.In this system, a plug-in was developed on Visio to achieve the conversion from written records and CAD drawings to Visio graphics. The Visio plug-in for visualized simulation of foundation pits block excavation and instrumentations layout is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointVisio plug-in for visualized simulation of excavation and instrumentations layout.3.5. Dynamic and Synchronous AnalysisBased on the curve modeling of monitoring data and state modeling of excavation stages, the system was applied for establishing a connection between them with the help of time nodes (see Figure3).

"analysis of monitoring data and construction information was carried out by the multithreading technique under the .NET framework ultimately. In the foundation pit group, construction difficulties and risks occur in typical excavation condition and essential nodes generally. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the deformations of adjacent deep excavations when excavation reaches the bottom level and supporting system is removed.For example, the lateral deflection of diaphragm walls and ground settlement behind the walls are common coupling relationship in the process of excavation (Figure5), which includes (1) the global dynamic and synchronous control system and time information, (2) the curve of ground settlement against elapsed time, and (3) the wall lateral deformation curve. Therefore, the wall lateral deflections and ground settlement can be clearly obtained attached to the synchronous change between excavations.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDynamic and coupled analysis of monitoring with excavation stages.The system has several advantages. It is able to process a variety of monitoring data simultaneously to analyze the interaction between different monitoring items. In addition to the correlation analysis of different types of monitoring data, the system can also accomplish coupling analysis under different spatial distributions from the same type of data, as well as the interaction analysis between partial block excavations of adjacent foundation pits.4."

Application for Adjacent Excavation4.1. Project OverviewThe deep foundation pit project covered an area of approximately 187,200 m2with a largest excavation depth of 20m. The foundation pit was divided into six areas: A1, A2, B, C1, C2, and D, which were separated by three roads and formed a large-scale and dense foundation pit group. For the excavation process of foundation pit group, pit A1 was excavated first, and the other pits were excavated simultaneously. In order to implement the refined management of massive construction information and monitoring data, the adjacent foundation pits C1 and D in Shanghai Word Expo Project are taken as the research objects [30]. Then, the deformation behaviors were analyzed during the excavation.The excavation area of pit C1 and pit D was 14,361 m2and 19,320 m2, respectively, and the distance in between was 20 m. Both of them were excavated with the cut-and-cover construction method (Figure6). Pit C1 and pit D were excavated in four stages to the elevation of −11.250 m and five stages to the elevation of −14.300 m, respectively. The excavation progress is simplified into four stages and five stages for pit C1 and pit D, respectively, as shown in Table3.Figure 6Open in figure"

Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the soil within a certain range at the bottom of the foundation pit before excavation to ensure the reasonable and controlled deformation.4.2.

"the construction process, the stress and deformation of the foundation pits were monitored, and the main monitoring items included the wall lateral deflections, the ground settlement behind wall, and the displacement at the top of the wall. The wall lateral deflections were monitored by inclinometer instruments with the measured points named CX in pit C1 and DX in pit D, respectively. The ground settlement behind the walls was monitored by level instruments with the measured points named D1-D6 in global excavation. The displacement at the top of diaphragm walls was monitored by total station instrument with the measured points named CQ in pit C1 and DQ in pit D, respectively. The layout of all measured points and corresponding distance are shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointLayout of measured points and corresponding distance.Wall lateral deflections at middle sides are the focus of this paper. To monitor the deflections of diaphragms in the excavation of pits C1 and D, inclinometer tubes were tied to the reinforcing cages and at the same depth. Two cross-sliding grooves were set in the tubes with one perpendicular to the walls. Meanwhile, the field data of deflections were measured every day during excavation.4.3. The VSCM Model of Digital System in Excavation ProcessDense measured points were set up on the foundation pit group and surrounding environment to obtain massive field monitoring data in the construction process of Shanghai Word Expo Project."
"The VSCM Model of Digital System in Excavation ProcessDense measured points were set up on the foundation pit group and surrounding environment to obtain massive field monitoring data in the construction process of Shanghai Word Expo Project. Based on that the three-dimensional information, excavation stages, and measured point arrangement were recorded in Revit through the VSCM system; the dynamic and visual excavation process can be displayed in real time (Figure8). Therefore, that information recorded in VSCM against elapsed time was exported to SQL Server database by combining with the data conversion interface, and the excavation stages information was synchronously transformed into Visio graph.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointRecording of instrumentations arrangement of the Expo Project with Revit.4.4. Measured Maximum Lateral Deflection of Adjacent FoundationAs an important monitoring and analysis object in excavation, lateral deflections of diaphragm walls act as an important controlling factor for the safety of foundation pit. This part takes the lateral deflection in pits C1 and D as an example to illustrate the interactions in each excavation stage of adjacent foundation pits. There are respectively five (CX5, CX7, CX9, CX13, and CX15) and ten (D1∼D3, D6∼D8, D16, D18, D21, and D22) typical measured points in the foundation pits C1 and D selected in this project for statistical analysis and drawing curves of maximum lateral deflection.The general variation of"
"CX7, CX9, CX13, and CX15) and ten (D1∼D3, D6∼D8, D16, D18, D21, and D22) typical measured points in the foundation pits C1 and D selected in this project for statistical analysis and drawing curves of maximum lateral deflection.The general variation of the maximum wall lateral deflections at typical measuring points of both pits C1 and D against elapsed time is obtained (Figure9). Generally speaking, the maximum lateral deflection increases with the continuous excavation by marking the excavation stages of the foundation pit. The walls in pit D tend to be stabilized after excavation to the bottom, while the deflection of pit C1 continues increasing within a month after the final excavation stage which is caused by removal of the struts. The results show that the adjacent excavation has mutual influence on the wall lateral deflection.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointMeasured maximum lateral deflections of adjacent foundation in both pits C1 and D.5. Results and DiscussionThe deformation behavior and environment impact of the foundation pit group at each excavation stage are revealed. The system can present the changes of different types of monitoring data simultaneously (see Figure5).

"tendency of monitoring data with excavation stages in a foundation pit group, the system is also used to carry out refined modeling of block excavation. Synchronous analysis consisted of excavation stages model and monitoring data curve is conducted to examine the interactions of adjacent excavations.It can be found by the monitoring curves of maximum lateral deflection that the wall lateral deflection of the adjacent side is less than that of the far side. Locally, the curve of clinometer CX5 shows a \"downward convex shape\" in the third layer soil excavation, indicating that the wall bounces outward. The special phenomenon illustrates the locally unbalanced soil pressure on both sides of the adjacent foundation with the unloading effect of excavation, which causes the local and outward movement of the diaphragm wall.In order to revel the rebound phenomenon of the diaphragm wall, the partitioned excavation is meticulously modelled in the foundation pit group. The dynamic synchronous playback is conducted by comparing the excavation stages and monitoring the curve in visualization model (Figure10). The measured point and the freshly excavated soil are represented by red dot and red star, respectively. It can be quickly found that local excavation will lead to local imbalance of soil pressure on both sides of the adjacent foundation pit. Therefore, the unloading effect can cause local movement of wall to the outside of the pit.Figure 10Open in figure"

ConclusionsIn this paper, a digital system for the foundation pit group has been developed that enabled information record, database establishment, and visual modeling during adjacent deep excavations. The system was applied to a foundation pit group of Shanghai World Expo Project to manage construction information and monitoring data. With the developed system, the performance and interactions of foundation pits were analyzed.The VSCM for construction information and monitoring data was proposed based on Revit software which consists of three modules: excavation, monitoring, and construction information. The system can record and manage the three-dimensional geometry information and excavation stages of foundation pit against elapsed time to facilitate the dynamic query of the entire construction process.As a functional integration system, the digital system for dynamic and synchronous analysis was developed through SQL Server database with standardization management function.

"analysis was developed through SQL Server database with standardization management function. Meanwhile, it was developed through secondary development of Visio and Excel tools with visualization and curve modeling function. In terms of application, the digital system was applied to the several adjacent excavations of Shanghai World Expo Project which revealed the variation of wall lateral deflections. The efficient analysis method is capable to investigate abnormal performance and analyze the interactions with surrounding environment efficiently, which is of great benefit for similar projects to provide guidance.In the whole analysis process, the massive monitoring data were integrated and correlated in the form of dynamic visualization. With the developed system, correlations between different types of monitoring data and excavation stages can be mined more efficiently.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the study participants and teachers for their cooperation and support.

"of system information security, information traceability, and rapid information query, the problems in nursing management have been basically solved.1. IntroductionThe rapid development of computer information technology makes nursing management develop into intelligence gradually. Foreign researchers use Internet technology to connect nursing management to the hospital information network so that medical staff can obtain patients' physical signs data remotely. The nursing management system uses information technology to set various parameters in advance. The system can set various parameters in advance, the system can remind the patient to take medicine on time according to the parameters set, and the collection of the patient's signs' data through the Internet can be sent to the terminal, for doctors and family members to view. The social medical service system in China is not perfect. Most patients go to tertiary hospitals regardless of the severity of their illness, which makes the emergency departments of tertiary hospitals overcrowded. When emergency medical resources are inevitably dispersed to noncritical patients, the ability of the entire emergency medical system to treat critically ill patients will decrease. With the increasing workload of emergency departments, manual statistical data and information will be lost to varying degrees, and the preservation, collection, and analysis of emergency medical data lack norms and efficiency.

Basic Architecture of Intelligent Emergency CareThe intelligent emergency centre applies intelligent information technology to the emergency environment with strict real-time requirements. As the intersection of modern information technology and medicine, the intelligent emergency centre has broad development space and practical value. According to the current situation of the low emergency degree in emergency centres and combined with the urgent and hectic characteristics of emergency medical work, an information project was designed and implemented [9]. Based on the hospital network platform, the layout structure, business process, service management, and quality control of outpatient and emergency departments are optimized in an all-round way, so as to alleviate the pain of patients. In this whole process link to develop the corresponding information system, intelligently building this platform, with platform \"all-in-one-card\" as the core, it runs through the whole process of prehospital appointment, in-hospital reception and treatment, posttreatment inquiry, and evaluation: making an appointment, self-help leading examining, self-help do card, prepaid phone, registering, clinic queuing howl, outpatient doctor workstation, taking medicine denominated in a queue, auxiliary diagnosis department charge"

"Nursing Monitoring System FrameworkClient application: an intelligent terminal used by medical staff to edit and consult business data through this application, which is the user's actual operation interface. It is mainly composed of two parts: Android terminal and iPad. Application server: sandwiched between the database server and the client application, it plays the role of data exchange, is responsible for the implementation of the business logic of the whole system, can carry on the security authentication and the system upgrade to the client, has the role of connecting the preceding and the following, and is the core key of the whole system. Part of the application server is made up of mature and functional Microsoft IIS. Database server: the lowest level of the system, mainly composed of the existing information system of the hospital, which provides data and updates. His, LIS, and EMR are its main components. The monitoring framework is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointBasic architecture of intelligent nursing monitoring.2.4. Intelligent Nursing FunctionThe intelligent nursing system is that nurses use mobile intelligent terminals to scan the barcode of patients' wristbands, accurately identify the identity of patients, input vital signs beside the patient's bed, and write the condition observation, so as to reduce paper transcribing, reduce workload, and improve the accuracy and timeliness of nursing work [10]. Nurses scan the barcode of"
"the identity of patients, input vital signs beside the patient's bed, and write the condition observation, so as to reduce paper transcribing, reduce workload, and improve the accuracy and timeliness of nursing work [10]. Nurses scan the barcode of medicines and check patients' wristbands through handheld smart terminals to avoid medical errors. At the same time, the closed-loop implementation of the doctor's order is achieved, and the traceability problem of the infusion and drug is realized. The mobile nursing subsystem not only ensures the safety of patient diagnosis and treatment but also evaluates the performance of nursing work, guarantees the safety of patients' clinical nursing, improves the nursing level, and normalizes nursing behaviour [11]. The functional requirements of the intelligent nursing system are shown in Figure4.Bulletin board: this interface displays the basic information of the ward of the hospital, such as the number of patients in the ward, the grade of nursing, and the information of critical patients. The key point records at work should be viewed and edited by all nurses in the ward, and the head nurse needs to manage; the ward nurses work in some requirements of the record.Execution of medical orders: the mobile nursing subsystem is mainly to execute the clinical medical orders and complete the closed-loop operation of medical orders. Entering the doctor's order execution window and scanning the barcode on the patient's wristband, you can view"
"orders: the mobile nursing subsystem is mainly to execute the clinical medical orders and complete the closed-loop operation of medical orders. Entering the doctor's order execution window and scanning the barcode on the patient's wristband, you can view the doctor's order items that the patient has executed and the doctor's order items to be executed. The patient's infusion bottle sticker, drug package barcode, and test tube barcode can be scanned again to complete the closed-loop execution of infusion and medication and test doctor's orders. The barcode of patients' wristbands, drugs, infusion, and test specimens can be matched one-to-one, which not only realizes the traceability of medical orders but also effectively fills the last ten meters of medical workstations and patients' beds.Nursing evaluation: within 24 hours of admission, nurses need to conduct admission nursing evaluation, fall bed evaluation, and pressure sores nursing evaluation on patients through mobile handheld terminals, so as to understand the basic situation of patients, determine the nursing level of patients, reduce a large number of nurses to copy labour, and improve nursing efficiency.Nursing records: all nursing services received by patients should be recorded through intelligent terminals, nursing data should be saved, patient nursing data should be summarized, effective management of nurse nursing services can be realized, service quality can be improved, and patient satisfaction can be"
"should be recorded through intelligent terminals, nursing data should be saved, patient nursing data should be summarized, effective management of nurse nursing services can be realized, service quality can be improved, and patient satisfaction can be promoted.Vital signs: the nurse can connect the internal network of the hospital through the intelligent handheld terminal and record the patient's temperature, pulse, respiratory frequency, frequency of urine, and faces beside the patient's bed, which will be synchronized to the hospital database server and sent to the doctor in time to provide a medical diagnosis. At the same time, the system can carry out the batch entry of vital signs and accurate and efficient entry of patients' nursing indicators.Voice call: when the infusion is about to end in the ward, the patient's family members or patients themselves need to go to the nurse station to remind the nurse that the infusion is about to run out, and the needle can be pulled out or the bottle can be changed. In practice, the information that \"infusion is about to end\" cannot be conveyed to the treating nurse due to various conditions of the patient. It not only affects the treatment of patients but also has life-threatening risks, and the timeliness of artificial oral replacement cannot be guaranteed. Through the intelligent nursing system, a direct voice call can be made to the current treatment nurse in the ward, informing the responsible nurse in the first time, so that"
"risks, and the timeliness of artificial oral replacement cannot be guaranteed. Through the intelligent nursing system, a direct voice call can be made to the current treatment nurse in the ward, informing the responsible nurse in the first time, so that patients can run fewer errands and much information.Thermometer distribution: at this stage, the patient's temperature is mainly measured through a mercury thermometer, and then the nurse takes back the thermometer and records it. Due to the large number of rooms and patients in the ward, it is often not possible to clearly record the distribution of thermometers. The intelligent nursing system has the function of thermometer management, which records the distribution of the thermometer and reminds the nurse to recover the thermometer after the end of the measurement time, so as to achieve accurate management.Ward patrol: according to the time required by the standard of graded nursing, the nurse needs to patrol the ward according to the condition and needs of special patients. The mobile nursing system adopts a ward inspection interface, which is convenient for nurses to scan patients' wristbands, conduct ward inspections, record inspection data, and collect them at the end of the month, so as to realize the assessment of nursing quality.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointIntelligent nursing function.2.5.

Multisystem IntegrationIntegration is to integrate several small systems with different functions into a large system with multiple functions by using systems engineering theory, so as to give full play to the comprehensive efficiency of the large system [12]. Intelligent emergency centre is an intelligent system with a complex structure that integrates HIS, LIS, PACS, critical care information system, emergency information system, and other functions related to emergency treatment. The system will be doctors and nurses operation process; inspection, application for inspection, and return of results; handling of charge accounting; and department management and other links into the computer management system, to replace the flow of people with information flow, to realize the emergency centre of the flow of people, logistics, capital flow, and other information implementation of decentralized collection, unified management, centralized use, and all the automated mode of sharing, to provide a fast navigation device or interface for medical staff.

System integration is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem integration diagram.2.6. System Network DesignIn the construction of the mobile medical system, the wireless network is the top priority. Only a scientific overall structure of the wireless network can achieve stable and high-speed data transmission. The ward in the hospital is different from the general conference venue. There are many rooms in the hospital. The room area is large, the walls are thick, the corridor of the department is long and narrow, and there are various cables such as oxygen, circuit, and communication above the ceiling, and the environment is complex. In view of the above special environment and the actual situation of the hospital, wireless controller, wireless switch, and wireless access point are adopted to build the hospital wireless network [13]. The topology of the wireless network is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointWireless network topology.3. Application of the Intelligent Nursing Information System3.1. Application and Management of the Intelligent Protest and Triage SystemThe automatic classification of quantified triage indicators and region-oriented intelligent triage system are based on the quantifiable triage standard system of emergency reexamination and triage, and the intelligent software of emergency reexamination"
"automatic classification of quantified triage indicators and region-oriented intelligent triage system are based on the quantifiable triage standard system of emergency reexamination and triage, and the intelligent software of emergency reexamination and triage is developed by using computer technology to realize computer-aided reexamination and triage [14]. The intelligent triage system for patients' disease classification mainly takes the symptoms of body parts as the evaluation guide; inputs the patient's name, age, vital signs parameters, pain score, adjustment parameters, and so on the computer; and automatically generates the patient's condition grade. At the same time, a printer is connected to print out the patient's information and grade on red, yellow, and green printed paper and affixed to the patient's medical record. The principle of disease classification and treatment time in our hospital is as follows: red refers to Grade 1 resuscitation or endangered patients, and patients are directly sent to the emergency room in the red zone. The first-grade critically ill patients were rescued immediately and treated within 15 minutes in the red zone or the yellow zone. Level 2 emergency patients: according to the condition, emergency arrangement of priority diagnosis and treatment is generally done within 30 minutes of emergency treatment in the yellow area. Level 3 nonemergency patients are treated sequentially in the green area and treated within 2 hours.The triage"
"emergency arrangement of priority diagnosis and treatment is generally done within 30 minutes of emergency treatment in the yellow area. Level 3 nonemergency patients are treated sequentially in the green area and treated within 2 hours.The triage desk is equipped with an auxiliary triage system connected to command platform, which releases the general information of the next emergency patient on the LED display terminal in advance, including gender, age, main illness, departure place, and approximate arrival time; makes full preparations for supplies; and informs the doctor in advance of the layout and equipment of 1 division. At the time of developing the intelligent triage system, the environment of the emergency room was modified to match its function. Three colours of red, yellow, and green represent the three areas in the transformed emergency department, and the background decoration and medical signs in each area are corresponding colours. The red area is the emergency room, the yellow area is the emergency treatment area, adjacent to the emergency room, and the green area is the general treatment area. In addition, red, yellow, and green landmarks are adopted in the emergency area, and the arrow guiding function is clear at a distance. The emergency hall provides TV and wireless network and other services to improve details and humanized services, which to some extent reduces the anxious state of patients waiting for treatment.Division nursing human resources"
"is clear at a distance. The emergency hall provides TV and wireless network and other services to improve details and humanized services, which to some extent reduces the anxious state of patients waiting for treatment.Division nursing human resources allocation and management personnel management is mainly for the yellow area, the green area, and the prediagnosis table. Since the general diagnosis and treatment is divided into yellow area and green area, one more itinerant nurse is added to carry out treatment and health education and other services for emergency patients in the yellow area. The other nurse is mainly responsible for the order of the rooms in the yellow area and the green area and the coordination of patient diversion. Due to the use of the new intelligent system, the workload of prediagnosis increased. Two nurses were assigned to the post and the admission system of prediagnosis nurses was established. Only those with certain working experience, clear thinking, and qualified training of the new system could take the post. The prediagnosis nurse makes the correct disease classification, communicates with the itinerant nurse in time, and plays a guiding role in the patient's regional consultation.3.2.

"Nursing Safety Control ApplicationPatient safety control is primarily concerned with problematic areas of health care, particularly the identification of patients during the administration of drugs, transfusions, or blood products; the drawing of blood or the testing of other clinical specimens; or the delivery of treatment or procedures. The hospital's compliance with patient safety objectives is regarded as an independent decision item in the review and decision-making process, and the one-vote veto system is implemented. It can be seen that patient safety plays a very important role in the quality of hospital medical service.At present, barcode technology has been widely used in the system, outpatient and emergency mobile infusion management system, prescription dispensing subsystem, etc., providing a simple and convenient management approach for the safety control of outpatient and emergency patients. A barcode is a mark that expresses a group of information by arranging multiple black bars and blanks with different widths according to certain coding rules [15]. The bar is the part that is less reflective of light, and the empty is the part that is more reflective of light. Barcode technology is born along with the development and application of computer and information technology. It can be converted into binary or decimal information which can be recognized by the computer. It is a new technology integrating coding, printing, identification, and data acquisition and"
"and application of computer and information technology. It can be converted into binary or decimal information which can be recognized by the computer. It is a new technology integrating coding, printing, identification, and data acquisition and processing. In the process of medical service, the barcode can be used as the identification information and scanned by the scanning gun to realize the rapid extraction of the corresponding patient information from the database of the computer system. The hospital tests equipment to achieve all online.The whole inspection process includes barcode label printing, barcode specimen identification processing, report feedback transmission, and self-service query and printing of clinical departments and outpatient and emergency patients. Barcode technology plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of outpatient and emergency infusion. In the past, the outpatient and emergency infusion is manually checked by the nurse, the liquid, and the filling of drugs. The nurse checks again and again, which is inefficient and risky. The outpatient mobile infusion management system automatically generates the patient's barcode information by computer and automatically prints two sets of infusion cards with identical information, including the patient's name, gender, age, drug dose, concentration, drip count, time of treatment, and other information. One is given to the patient for scanning at the time of injection, and the other is affixed"
"cards with identical information, including the patient's name, gender, age, drug dose, concentration, drip count, time of treatment, and other information. One is given to the patient for scanning at the time of injection, and the other is affixed to the pouch. Before the injection, the nurse uses a handheld computer to scan the barcode of the infusion card on the soft infusion bag. An electronic voice system automatically calls the number, and the patient hears the call and arrives at the puncture table. If the patient's line does not match the barcode of the fluid, the computer will send an alarm to remind the patient not to inject. After the infusion, the palm computer scanning, the patient's total bag of infusion, each bag of drug type, specific time, and infusion process can be clear at a distance, before pulling out the needle to understand the patient's treatment effect, after the confirmation of the end of treatment and then pulling out the needle. The use of barcode can effectively identify the identity of patients and drugs in both directions, which adds a safe defence line for outpatient and emergency infusion management. While optimizing the traditional workflow, it reduces the labour intensity of nurses and improves their work efficiency. The infusion card and bottle label are automatically printed to avoid the hidden danger caused by unclear handwriting by hand, check the infusion drugs with patients, and implement the system of three checks and eight pairs"
"improves their work efficiency. The infusion card and bottle label are automatically printed to avoid the hidden danger caused by unclear handwriting by hand, check the infusion drugs with patients, and implement the system of three checks and eight pairs into the monitoring state to ensure the safety of patients' medication and treatment.3.3. Intelligent Nursing Medical Advice Information ApplicationAfter the nurse scans the barcode of the patient's wristband through the intelligent terminal, the patient is identified and the detailed information of the patient is displayed, as well as the content of the doctor's order. According to the type of the doctor's order, the label is divided into infusion book, treatment book, medication book, doctor's order book, new start, and new stop. The nurse can directly click the execute button on the doctor's order information to execute or confirm the execution by scanning the outer package of the drug, the infusion bottle sticker, and the barcode on the test tube. Meanwhile, the system automatically records the executor and the execution time [16].
