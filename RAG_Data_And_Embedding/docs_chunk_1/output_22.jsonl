Niger State (see Figure1) is a state in the North Central Nigeria, covering a total land mass of 76,363â€‰Km2(about 10% of Nigeria's total land mass) and possessing an estimated population of 4,372,030 people (2,215,824 males and 2,156,206 females) [1]. It is the largest among the 36 states and the Federal Capital territory (FCT) of Nigeria and comprises 25 local government areas (LGAs).Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointMap of Niger State, Nigeria. Source: Zaccheus Onumba Dibiaezue Memorial Libraries [21].Niger State has been identified as one of the three best states in Nigeria for malaria control [2]. The state was recognized by The Global Fund (GF) in 2012 for malaria Round 8 implementation efforts. It is one of the states where the Support for National Malaria Programme (SuNMAP), the Department for International Development Fund (DFID), and The Global Fund AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM) Round 8 are all implementing malaria project interventions [2].The Association for Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH), a subrecipient to National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) on GF Round 8 malaria in Niger State, was saddled with the responsibilities such as malaria case management through supply and tracking rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), advocacy communication, and social mobilization and health system strengthening through capacity"
"the responsibilities such as malaria case management through supply and tracking rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), advocacy communication, and social mobilization and health system strengthening through capacity building and monitoring and evaluation [3]. In the course of implementing the project, there were several instances in which patients demanded ACT without confirmatory tests or with negative RDT test results. Inequities in commodity procurement and distribution were also reported [4]. These irregularities provided the motivation for the current study.According to WHO's recommendation, in malaria-endemic countries like Nigeria, everyone with suspected malaria should be diagnosed with RDTs or microscopy, and those testing positive should be treated with ACTs [5,6]. On this basis, Nigeria adopted the requirement for the use of parasitological tests as one of the key interventions in improving malaria diagnosis and treatment [7,8].Prior to WHO's recommendation, malaria treatment in Niger State was based on clinical diagnosis (relying on signs and symptoms) instead of laboratory tests, according to the Niger State Health Management Information System (HMIS) database [9]. This finding is consistent with the results of a 2009 study in Enugu State, Nigeria, that showed over 50 percent presumptive treatment of malaria [10]. Due to the habitual practice of clinical diagnosis and symptomatic treatment of patients, health workers'"
"finding is consistent with the results of a 2009 study in Enugu State, Nigeria, that showed over 50 percent presumptive treatment of malaria [10]. Due to the habitual practice of clinical diagnosis and symptomatic treatment of patients, health workers' capacity to conduct parasitological diagnosis fell below standard [11]. Symptomatic clinical diagnosis solely is not dependable, and difficulties with microscopy (both human and technical requirements) necessitated alternatives such as RDTs, which have been found to be eminently suitable [12].The aforementioned study in Enugu State, which was conducted in a setting similar to Niger State, showed that the use of RDTs significantly reduced antimalaria drug prescriptions and was more cost effective when compared to other diagnostic methods for malaria in endemic areas [10]. Even in low transmission regions, RDTs have proven to be effective [13]. Studies conducted in Tanzania [14] and Ghana [15] showed that RDTs utilization improved correct treatment more than microscopy (microscopy led to excessive ACT prescription). Similarly, improvement was recorded in Uganda, where 39 percent reduction in ACT prescription occurred due to introduction of RDTs [16]. A study in Zanzibar [17] also showed that RDTs use decreased ACT prescription.Access to malaria confirmatory tests is seriously underutilized in more than half of endemic African nations: at least 80 percent of malaria treatments are administered without diagnostic testing [18,19]."
"showed that RDTs use decreased ACT prescription.Access to malaria confirmatory tests is seriously underutilized in more than half of endemic African nations: at least 80 percent of malaria treatments are administered without diagnostic testing [18,19]. RDTs are difficult to obtain, and supplies of ACTs are more than twice those of RDTs, making overuse of ACTs likely in both public and private sectors. Prices of ACTs are far beyond the previously used monotherapies, so investment in RDTs will reduce costs [20].Methodology. In order to achieve the set objectives, the current study consists primarily of literature review, supported with data from the Niger State, HMIS data for 375 public health facilities (January-October 2013), and analyzed within a conceptual framework for assessing access to health services (as described below).Literature Review. Peer-reviewed literature was obtained using a keyword search of databases (VU library and PubMed) and the use of Google Scholar. Grey literature was obtained from searches of institutional websites such as SuNMAP, ARFH, Niger State Government, Nigeria National Malaria Control Programme, and WHO.The key search terms used singly and in combination included Niger State, Nigeria, Sub-Saharan Africa, rapid diagnostic tests, RDTs, artemisinin combination therapy, ACT, acceptance, barriers, availability, willingness, perception, stock-out, guidelines, malaria, and HMIS.Data Review.

"Africa, rapid diagnostic tests, RDTs, artemisinin combination therapy, ACT, acceptance, barriers, availability, willingness, perception, stock-out, guidelines, malaria, and HMIS.Data Review. The Global Fund commenced RDTs rollout in Niger State in 2012 with 250 public health facilities (HFs), while simultaneously providing malaria-specific HMIS training and documentation. In 2013 the number increased to 375 (15 per local government area (LGA)). In the current study, review of January to October HMIS 2013 data from these supported HFs were carried out. The choice of these HFs was based on completeness of data, timeliness of submission of reports, and compliance with the data quality assessment checklist. It is important to mention that a total of 1249 HFs (994 public and 255 private HFs), 1200 registered patent medicine stores, and 70 pharmacies were excluded from the study.Analysis was based on key performance indicators recorded in the database, such as the numbers of persons in each of the following categories: presented with fever; presented with fever and tested using RDTs; presented with fever and tested using microscopy; clinically diagnosed for malaria; confirmed for uncomplicated malaria and treated with ACTs; and treated with ACTs on the basis of clinical diagnosis only [25].

"with ACTs on the basis of clinical diagnosis only [25]. Monthly totals for each indicator for the period under review were recorded. Several comparisons were made, including number of patients presented with fever versus parasitological confirmation with RDTs; quantity of ACTs versus quantity of RDTs supplied in 2013; number of patients with fever versus number of patients with positive test results; and patients with positive test results using RDTs versus number of patients treated at HFs.Conceptual Framework. To effectively analyze access to malaria RDTs in Niger State, Nigeria, the conceptual framework of Peters et al. [22] was adapted. The framework was chosen because of its ability to address supply and demand elements of healthcare delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thematic areas in the framework are shown in Figure2. The current paper uses these areas in the framework to address accessibility barriers to RDTs as follows:(i)policy and macroenvironment elements: (a) Nigeria national malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines and (b) implementation of malaria diagnosis guidelines in Niger State,(ii)individual and household characteristics: (a) age and (b) educational attainment, poverty, and vulnerability,(iii)geographic accessibility: (a) service location and (b) user's location,(iv)financial accessibility: (a) cost and price of services and (b) user's resources and willingness to pay,(v)availability: (a) health workers, drugs, and equipment and (b) demand for"

Findings2.1. Section LayoutThis section presents results of the literature review, complemented by the analysis of Niger State secondary data, using Peters et al. [22] as a conceptual framework. The adapted conceptual framework ascribes utilization characteristics of RDTs to key elements of the framework, (1) policy and macroenvironment, (2) individual and household characteristics, (3) geographical accessibility, (4) financial accessibility, (5) availability, (6) acceptability, and (7) quality, which connects the previous four dimensions. In the following, we consider each of these elements in turn.2.2. Policy and MacroenvironmentNigeria National Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines as Contained in the Strategic Plan. Nigeria's National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) Strategic Plan for 2009-2013 consists of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of malaria [26].

"Guidelines as Contained in the Strategic Plan. Nigeria's National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) Strategic Plan for 2009-2013 consists of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of malaria [26]. The plan expresses the goal of \"timely and equitable access to malaria diagnosis and treatment by all sections of the population and as close to the home as possible\" [26, page 24]. It is partly aligned with the 2010 edition of WHO's recommendation for parasitological confirmation of malaria by RDTs as one of the prioritized interventions in improving diagnosis and treatment.At the national level, the expansion of access to RDTs use was aimed at increasing parasitological diagnosis to 40 percent in 2013 and 60 percent by 2014 [27]. These targets were unrealistic, as diagnosis using RDTs was limited and coverage was largely dependent on donors. The 2010 malaria indicator survey revealed that only 9.1 percent of children under five with fever in the north central region of Nigeria (including Niger State) had parasitological confirmation using RDTs [28].A statewide rollout of RDTs in Oyo State, Nigeria, in 2012 was followed by increased ACT prescription rather than decrease. RDTs findings were not respected, as the ratio of ACT-treated patients to RDT-positive patients was consistently greater than 1 [29]. On the other hand, findings from a similar setting in Sudan showed that RDTs rollout was successful at the community through Home Management of Malaria (HMM) and led to improvement"
"patients to RDT-positive patients was consistently greater than 1 [29]. On the other hand, findings from a similar setting in Sudan showed that RDTs rollout was successful at the community through Home Management of Malaria (HMM) and led to improvement in treatment-seeking attitude of people [30]. A similar study in Uganda concluded that implementation of RDTs through community health workers (CHWs) required acceptance by the community, which was contingent on proper training, supervision, and logistical support of the CHWs [31].Implementation of Guidelines on Malaria Diagnosis in Niger State. The 2009-2013 Strategic Plan for malaria in Niger State was implemented in collaboration with NMCP through GF Round 8. RDTs were first rolled out in 12 states in Nigeria, including Niger State, as a follow-up to WHO recommendation on parasitological diagnosis [26].Translating the shift in guidelines into routine effective use of RDTs by service providers requires clear messages and guidelines that are adapted to local settings [32,33]. Previously, in Niger State these requirements were not met. To improve this situation, capacity buildings were conducted at all HFs (375), and 400 Role Model Caregivers (RMCs) were supported by GF. Also, monthly review meetings, supportive supervision, and data collection were instituted [34].2.3. Individual and Household Characteristics\"Individual and household characteristics have to do with socioeconomic position, vulnerability, and the health status."
"monthly review meetings, supportive supervision, and data collection were instituted [34].2.3. Individual and Household Characteristics\"Individual and household characteristics have to do with socioeconomic position, vulnerability, and the health status. Poverty can be examined as a determinant of illness or health needs\" [22].Age of Patient. In Niger State, findings from analysis of state HMIS 2013 data showed that 40 percent of patients treated for malaria were children and approximately 21 percent of them were treated symptomatically through HMM [25]. Similarly, NDHS [36] showed that, for children aged 6-59 months with fever, 60.9 percent (n= 1, 268) of urban children and 41.2 percent (n= 2, 362) of rural children were treated for malaria presumptively during the two weeks prior to the survey. A qualitative study from Enugu State Nigeria showed that RDTs were rarely used for children due to their unavailability in consulting rooms, as well as doubts about their reliability [37]. It is common amongst caregivers and women to insist on prescription for their children, so that the use of RDTs for diagnosis is limited in younger age groups. In accordance with the 2013 Niger State Malaria Control Operational Plan (NMCOP), as long as RDTs are available at health facility almost all adults with fever were tested with RDTs [34].Educational Level, Poverty, and Vulnerability.

"as RDTs are available at health facility almost all adults with fever were tested with RDTs [34].Educational Level, Poverty, and Vulnerability. A study by NPC, NMCP, and ICF International [28] showed that educational attainment of caregivers and women correlates with their knowledge of how to care for their families and themselves. It follows that the higher the level of education, the greater the receptivity to healthcare products such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and RDTs.Lack of education is positively correlated with poverty, and poverty restricts access to health services [22]. Currently, RDTs are free at supported health facilities in line with NMCOP 2013, but there are other costs that prevent people in the lowest wealth quintile from seeking malaria confirmatory tests, such as transportation to health facilities and lost income due to person-hours lost [38].UNESCO [39] estimates literacy level for males and females in Niger State at 19.3 and 18.2 percent, respectively. Most of the population of Niger State consists of farmers with low financial capacity, according to NSMCP [9]. The currently low uptake of LLINs and RDTs corresponds with the low incomes and low level of educational attainment in the state.2.4.

"Geographic AccessibilityGeographic accessibility is determined by \"the physical distance or travel time from service delivery point to the user\" [22, page 162].Service Location. There are 1626 health facilities (HFs) in the state (see Figure3). The health facilities are at 4 levels of ownership, comprising federal (23), state (24), local government (1324), and private (255). They are unevenly distributed compared with need: 40 percent of HFs are in urban areas that contain 30 percent of the population, while 60 percent of HFs are in rural areas, where 70 percent of the population resides [9].Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointNumber of health facilities by ownership. Source: NSMCP, 2013 [9].Service locations include health facilities, Home Management of Malaria (HMM), and private sector (clinics, patent medicine stores (1200), and pharmacies (70)). The Society for Family Health (SFH) is implementing GFATM activities in the private sector via social marketing of ACTs. RDTs and ACTs are supplied by GFATM and SuNMAP to 375 public health facilities out of a total of 1624. The grant supports 15 HFs within each LGA. There are 16 RMCs affiliated to HFs based on proximity within the LGAs. The RMCs are responsible for presumptive treatment of malaria at the community level. They receive and replenish ACTs and report data to the HFs [40].A critical factor for malaria diagnosis and case management is the location that people most often visit when they perceive they have malaria."
"treatment of malaria at the community level. They receive and replenish ACTs and report data to the HFs [40].A critical factor for malaria diagnosis and case management is the location that people most often visit when they perceive they have malaria. More than 60 percent of clients purchase antimalarials in private health facilities and in most cases (95 percent) purchase monotherapy antimalaria drugs [41]. The 15 HFs per LGA are unevenly distributed and grossly inadequate for effective service coverage [9]. The poor coverage of HFs and services are due to low political will by the state government, which is evident from its underfunding of malaria case management.According to the study of Awoleye [42], the terrain of the project location is crucial to effective implementation of public health programmes for malaria mitigation. For example, extensive seasonal flooding in Niger State inflicts hardship on programme implementers and limits access to healthcare by the users.Users' Locations. A study conducted in Kogi State, Nigeria, showed that only 18 percent of rural residents lived within 4â€‰km of a public health center, compared to 40 percent that lived more than 10â€‰km away from the nearest such facility. 62 percent of the residents close by sought medical treatment (and by proxy, malaria diagnostics and treatment) from government hospitals, compared to only 32 percent of distant residents [43].In most rural communities, the first level of care for fever cases is home"
"the residents close by sought medical treatment (and by proxy, malaria diagnostics and treatment) from government hospitals, compared to only 32 percent of distant residents [43].In most rural communities, the first level of care for fever cases is home management, through either GFATM-funded HMM or patent medicine vendors. Caregivers usually visit health facilities only when there is no improvement. However, RDTs results will frequently be invalid or negative on patients that have already been treated with antimalarial drugs [9].2.5. Financial AccessibilityFinancial accessibility is defined as \"the relationship between the price of services (in part affected by their costs) and the willingness and ability of users to pay for those services, as well as be protected from economic consequences of health costs\" [22, page 162].User's Resources and Willingness to Pay. There are several obstacles to access to public healthcare, among which is the cost of treatment [44]. The concept of \"willingness to pay\" (WTP) has been applied to healthcare products such as insecticide-treated nets in Nigeria [45]. A study conducted in Enugu State, Nigeria, by Uzochukwu et al. [46] showed that 51 percent of urban respondents were willing to commit resources to RDTs, compared to only 24.7 percent of rural respondents. Also, urban dwellers were ready to pay 235.49 naira, compared to 182.05 naira for rural residents. Since Niger State is made up of over 70 percent rural communities [47], this would"
"resources to RDTs, compared to only 24.7 percent of rural respondents. Also, urban dwellers were ready to pay 235.49 naira, compared to 182.05 naira for rural residents. Since Niger State is made up of over 70 percent rural communities [47], this would indicate a relatively low level of WTP. A similar study in Uganda [48] showed that WTP for RDTs in drug shops was higher for customers with higher socioeconomic status, and WTP for RDTs was lower than that for ACTs.Costs and Price of Services. RDTs implementation in Niger State was donor-driven and was limited to selected public health facilities. The RDTs were free to patients. If donor funding stops, then access and affordability by patients to RDTs will be affected. Prices charged for RDTs in the private sector in Niger State are unknown. In Lagos Nigeria, RDTs prices range from $2.52 to $16.81 USD and average $5.88â€‰USD, including the cost of charges on services such as diagnostic test but excluding consultation charges [49].The Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria (AMFm) was an intervention implemented at the private sector by the GFATM to increase access to ACTs and reduce the financial burden through subsidy [23]. Figure4shows changes in ACTs use in Nigeria before and after the introduction of subsidized ACTs in January 2011. The figure shows about 50 percent increase in ACTs following AMFm launch in both rural and urban areas. These results indicate that price is a key determinant of use of ACTs. Similar results should"
"the introduction of subsidized ACTs in January 2011. The figure shows about 50 percent increase in ACTs following AMFm launch in both rural and urban areas. These results indicate that price is a key determinant of use of ACTs. Similar results should be expected with RDTs. However, there are relatively few private practitioners in the rural areas of Niger State, so the impact of private subsidies on such areas may be diminished.Figure 4(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointChanges in ACTs use in Nigeria 17 months before AMFm subsidy (baseline) and 15 months after subsidy (endline).

AvailabilityPeters et al. characterize availability as \"having the right type of care available to those who need it such as hours of operation and waiting times that meet demands of those who would use care, as well as having the appropriate type of service providers and materials\" [22, page 162].Health Workers, Drug Equipment. The \"test, treat, and track\" recommendation of WHO means that ACTs and RDTs are required and should be available in appropriate quantities [18,19]. When RDTs were available in Niger State, there was a greater improvement in malaria case management at the primary health care level than was noticed in the secondary [9].The number of patients that service"
"be available in appropriate quantities [18,19]. When RDTs were available in Niger State, there was a greater improvement in malaria case management at the primary health care level than was noticed in the secondary [9].The number of patients that service providers have to attend to daily influences their performance and also determines waiting time of patients at health facilities. Both of these factors influence presumptive treatment. Table1shows the available health workers in Niger State, who serve a population of greater than 4 million. There is definitely an extreme shortage of human resources for health in Niger State overall. The shortage of personnel with training on malaria control is even more extreme: ARFH trained 369 for RDTs (4 percent) personnel out of 9,083 that are directly involved in malaria control [34].Table  1.Staff strength in Niger State.CategoryTotal in the stateDoctors234 (public = 167, private = 67)Nurses/midwives2037Lab scientists128Lab technicians43Pharmacists130 (public = 49, private = 81)Pharmacy technicians41Trained role model caregivers (RMCs)400Community health officers (CHOs)169Community health extension workers (CHEWS)2779Environmental health officers179Social welfare workers214Registered patent medicine vendors (PMVs)1200Source: NMCOP, 2013 [34].A study in Osun State in Nigeria emphasized that sparse access to health facilities produces a serious impact on sustainable growth through reduction of the number of workers' productive man hours"
"patent medicine vendors (PMVs)1200Source: NMCOP, 2013 [34].A study in Osun State in Nigeria emphasized that sparse access to health facilities produces a serious impact on sustainable growth through reduction of the number of workers' productive man hours [38]. Poor health facility accessibility in Enugu State Nigeria has contributed to self-diagnosis and medication by people in the lowest wealth quintile, and some turn to patent medicine vendors for treatment [50].Due to poor working conditions in the public service and societal expectations, health workers in Lagos State, Nigeria, often seek opportunities abroad, leading to attrition of skilled labour in health [51]. This \"brain drain\" has not affected the public service of Niger State, especially because most cases of uncomplicated malaria are handled by lower-level health workers that are unlikely to resign from their appointments.Figure5shows that roughly three times as many ACTs as RDTs were supplied by NMCP and SuNMAP in 2013. This is a typical case in which far more ACTs than RDTs are supplied to the service delivery points. In 2010, the ratio of RDTs to ACTs supplied by Global Fund was approximately 1â€‰:â€‰3. The Presidential Malaria Initiatives (PMI) also procured RDTs to ACTs in the ratio of 1â€‰:â€‰3 [27]. Ideally more RDTs than ACTs should be supplied, in order to allow for wastage and invalid results.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointQuantity of ACTs and RDTs supplied to Niger State by SuNMAP and NMCP in 2013."

Less than half of all RDTs distributed were actually used. These figures are for 2010, but Figure5shows that accessibility to RDTs remained a concern in 2013.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointProgrammatic results reported by GFATM malaria grant recipient on planning, distribution, and use of RDTs in 2010.

The study showed that providers' level of knowledge was poor: only 34.5 percent (resp., 73.5 percent) of nonhospital (resp., hospital) providers said that microscopy could be used to diagnose malaria. A 2012 study on the availability of RDTs in private facilities (clinics, pharmacies, private outlets, and laboratories) showed that only five out of one hundred and twenty (4.2 percent) such facilities in Lagos, Nigeria, had RDTs in stock [49].According to finding from HMIS, in the 375 Niger"

This may be due to poor access to RDTs as shown in Figure7; not all patients that presented fever were tested.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointNumber of patients with fever versus parasitological confirmation of malaria with RDTs, Niger State, January to October 2013 (HMIS data). Source: NSMCP, 2013 [9].Irregular and disproportionate supply of RDTs and ACTs in publically supported healthcare facilities is a major constraint in the implementation of RDT and quality of care in Niger State [53]. Table2shows an example from 2012.Table  2.Summary of First Quarter 2012 Stock Report.MonthPercentage of public health facilities stocked out of ACTsPercentage of public health facilities stocked out of RDTsJanuary76%100%February94%100%March0%100%Source: ARFH, 2012 [35].In the first quarter of 2012, there were no RDTs in any public health facilities, even after ACTs were replenished in March.

"even after ACTs were replenished in March. The Niger State stock supply pattern aligned with the findings of Zhao et al. [24] that rollout of RDTs always lags behind rollout of ACTs. ACTs and RDTs are supplied to health facility on a quarterly basis, typically in the ratio of 3â€‰:â€‰1 (as shown in Figure5). In a health facility with high patient flow, it takes RDTs only two weeks to be out of stock. In most facilities, RDTs are out of stock by the third week of every month [53].According to the supportive supervision report of ARFH [53], stockout of HMIS tools (data collection forms) constitutes accessibility constraint to knowing actual number of services provided and people reached. HMIS tools' availability is dependent on supplies from NMCP and donors [34].Demand for Services. Pregnant women (PW) with confirmed malaria demonstrated demand for ACTs. However, only PW in the second and third trimesters could be issued ACTs, in line with Mens' [54] recommendation on malaria treatment for PW. HMM is a strategy for prompt treatment of children under five, but findings showed that adults also demanded treatment from RMCs [53]. There is no data available on demand for RDTs, but relevant information is covered in the following section on users' attitudes and expectations.2.7. AcceptabilityAccording to Peters et al.

[22, page 162], acceptability is defined as \"the match between how responsive health service providers are to the social and cultural expectations of individual users and communities.\"Users' Attitudes and Expectations. No qualitative study on malaria diagnosis has been conducted in Niger State. A study in a similar situation in Enugu State, Nigeria, found that severe fever in children prompts their caregivers and parents to pressure health workers to treat children presumptively [37]. It is always difficult for women to wait for test results when their children exhibit serious symptoms such as vomiting and inability to eat food.Patients often expect treatment based on symptoms alone, because of their belief that symptoms as shivering, excessive body temperature, diarrhea, and vomiting are sufficient to prove malaria [31]. Because of the cost and inconvenience involved in coming to the hospital, patients are unwilling to leave the hospital without some type of medication [37].A study in Ghana showed that the presence of mosquitoes in patients' homes or environment influences their health-seeking behaviour. When they are feverish, they quickly conclude that mosquito bites were responsible and ask physician to prescribe antimalaria medication without further confirmation [55].As far as patients' specific perceptions of RDTs, no study has been conducted in Niger State. However, studies elsewhere in"
"that mosquito bites were responsible and ask physician to prescribe antimalaria medication without further confirmation [55].As far as patients' specific perceptions of RDTs, no study has been conducted in Niger State. However, studies elsewhere in Africa have shown that, especially in the rural areas, myths influence users' behaviour and practices. A study in Uganda found that some users were afraid that the drawing of blood from them or their children might cause HIV infections or be used for HIV testing. Some expressed anxiety that the blood could get into an enemy's hands and be used for witchcraft [31].One author's (OJA) personal experience from supervisory visits to HFs in Niger State revealed that patients and caregivers expect that when the service provider conducts RDTs, then ACT should be available for treatment in case results are positive. However, in Niger State, at times RDTs were available while ACT was out of stock, or vice versa. When these patients' expectations were not met, it influenced subsequent acceptance of tests because of uncertainty whether treatment would be given.Characteristics of Health Services. An important factor in user satisfaction with health services is preconsultation waiting times. A study of ophthalmological patients in southern Nigeria showed that long wait time was a major cause of patient dissatisfaction. Causes for long waits included nonadherence to appointment times, patients not seen in order of arrival, and lack of modern"
"A study of ophthalmological patients in southern Nigeria showed that long wait time was a major cause of patient dissatisfaction. Causes for long waits included nonadherence to appointment times, patients not seen in order of arrival, and lack of modern equipment that could shorten consultation time [56]. A study conducted in Kano State, Nigeria (a setting similar to Niger State), on patients' satisfaction with healthcare services, showed that 70 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with health workers' behaviour, while 30 percent expressed dissatisfaction with long waiting times [57].Health workers' adherence to guidelines reflects their responsiveness to users' expectations. In Kenya, lower-level healthcare providers such as nursing aides actually adhered to guidelines more closely compared to the higher-level staff such as clinical officers and nurses. Possible reasons for this included socialization effects (higher-level staff coming to view their own clinical judgment as superior to guidelines) and increased susceptibility to inappropriately prescribe second-line drugs [58]. In Niger State, 2013 programmatic report showed that irrespective of staff cadre, willingness and ability to adhere to guidelines were not the constraint, but rather availability of guidelines and RDTs [53].Poor attitude among health workers may pose a major obstacle to acceptance of RDTs results by caregivers [55].

"not the constraint, but rather availability of guidelines and RDTs [53].Poor attitude among health workers may pose a major obstacle to acceptance of RDTs results by caregivers [55]. Additionally, rather than following treatment guidelines based on RDTs results, health workers may tend to follow \"mindlines\" that are shaped by poor diagnostic support, pressure from peers, and perceptions of patient preferences and from training emphasis of malaria as the most important disease [59].2.8. QualityPeters et al. [22, page 162] state that \"quality of care is at the center of the circle of all four dimensions of access to health services, because it is an important component of each dimension and is ultimately related to the technical ability of health services to affect people's health.\"In the following, we present HMIS data that quantifies the quality of care of malaria patients at the 375 supported HFs in Niger State from January to October 2013.Figure7shows the level of RDT testing on patients with fever. The rise in fever cases from May through October reflects the seasonal malaria pattern of Niger State. The drop in testing rate from August to October was due to depletion of RDTs stock [9]. The figure shows that not all patients with fever that attended received tests, although this is contrary to WHO diagnosis and treatment guidelines and is a serious quality issue for malaria case management.Figure8shows the number of patients with fever cases as against number confirmed in"
"with fever that attended received tests, although this is contrary to WHO diagnosis and treatment guidelines and is a serious quality issue for malaria case management.Figure8shows the number of patients with fever cases as against number confirmed in the 375 HFs that had RDTs available. RDTs identified a significant proportion of fever cases that did not require malaria treatment, especially during the first seven months of the period before RDTs stock became depleted. Altogether, 53 percent of fever cases tested positive with RDTs (but it should be noted that the percentage would have been higher if the RDTs stockout had not occurred).Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointNumber of patients at supported HFs with fever compared to number with positive test results, Niger State, January to October. Source: NSMCP, 2013 [9].Figure9shows that, in the months of August and October, the number of patients treated was greater than the number of patients that tested positive.

"to October 2013 HMIS. Source: NSMCP, 2013 [9].Figure10shows that, in the early part of the year, the ratio of treated patients to RDTs-positive patients was typically close to one. This would indicate that guidelines for treatment and diagnosis were followed rather closely, and ACT prescription was reduced as a result of the use of RDTs. These findings agree with those of Uzochukwu et al. [10] in Enugu State but differ from those of Ige and Ayandipo [29] in Oyo State that showed increased ACT prescription rates after RDTs rollout. However, the stock outages later in the year made it impossible to continue to follow guidelines, and ACT prescription rates increased.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointPatients tested positive using RDTs as against number of patients treated at supported health facilities in Niger State, January to October 2013 (HMIS data). Source: NSMCP, 2013 [9].To improve the quality of data, the state in collaboration with implementing partners (IPs) conducted training at all supported HFs on malaria case management, logistics, and Health Management Information System (HMIS) tools. This training helped service providers to understand indicators such as persons presenting with fever and tested using RDTs and persons tested positive for malaria using RDTs. In addition to the training, HMIS data-capturing tools were also procured: in order to facilitate reporting on services such as diagnosis and treatment, nearly one million malaria reporting (HMIS) and"
"and persons tested positive for malaria using RDTs. In addition to the training, HMIS data-capturing tools were also procured: in order to facilitate reporting on services such as diagnosis and treatment, nearly one million malaria reporting (HMIS) and Logistic Management Information System (LMIS) tools were produced and distributed by the state government and implementing partners [34]. Within the private sector, SFH also built capacity of personnel responsible for data management [34].Accessibility to RDTs from the service provider's perspective is subject to knowledge and availability of the guidelines at the point of use. It was observed by the national monitoring and evaluation team that treatment guidelines were frequently unavailable at the service delivery points: for example, in some cases, the guidelines were locked up or were kept at home by the head of the HF. In addition, there was no provision for translation of the guidelines from English into local languages, which may be a significant obstacle for some lower-level providers and for private healthcare [34].To improve quality of case management, supportive supervision was initiated and conducted on monthly or quarterly bases by ARFH, SuNMAP, NMCP, and the state malaria control team. The LGA routinely supported health facilities, while the state team visited LGA and HFs monthly. NMCP and IPs visited the state and HFs on a quarterly basis [34].Another factor that affected the quality of healthcare delivery was"
"malaria control team. The LGA routinely supported health facilities, while the state team visited LGA and HFs monthly. NMCP and IPs visited the state and HFs on a quarterly basis [34].Another factor that affected the quality of healthcare delivery was the inability of the Niger State malaria control program and partners to quantify accurately the actual commodity required by the state, which resulted from inconsistent consumption data. Commodity management (including tracking of ACTs and RDTs) and appropriate usage of bin card, request, and requisition forms were not adequately handled by the peripherals HFs [34].The long time interval between training of health workers for RDTs and actual implementation may have had an adverse effect on the quality of testing. In Niger State, RDTs training was conducted in July 2011 while implementation commenced in June 2012 [53].3. DiscussionIn this section, we discuss best practices that enhance the use of RDTs.Using Community Health Workers (CHWs) to Implement RDTs.In a study conducted from 2007 to 2008 in Livingstone District of Southern Province, Zambia, by Counihan et al. [60], community health workers (CHWs) received a half-day training on RDT use and interpretation and were then sent out with job aids, supplies of RDTs, and paracetamol to treat RDT-negative patients. Follow-up visits were paid to CHWs after 3, 6, and 12 months. Photographs of RDTs with positive, negative, and invalid test results were used to determine whether CHWs"
"out with job aids, supplies of RDTs, and paracetamol to treat RDT-negative patients. Follow-up visits were paid to CHWs after 3, 6, and 12 months. Photographs of RDTs with positive, negative, and invalid test results were used to determine whether CHWs could identify results accurately. Findings showed that CHWs correctly identified results at 3rd month (87.7 percent) and at 12th month (100 percent). Also, interpretation of faint positive result drops to 76.7 percent at 12th months. The study concluded that training, supplies (RDTs, job aids, and consumables), and supervision can increase correct use of RDTs [60].Regular Supply of ACTs and RDTs. In a qualitative study conducted in Ghana [61], one health worker expressed that patients rated her health facility higher than others due to presence of RDTs and ACTs, which improved patients' acceptance of RDT results and their confidence in the judgment of health workers on patients' conditions. Another health worker in the same study said that the availability of RDTs makes patients think the health facility has been upgraded with new technology, thereby increasing patient turnout for services. The study further explains how only availability of commodity will not sustain adherence but should be combined with effective communication and respect for patient.Another study in Ghana showed that patients perceived accessibility of RDT kits as an advancement in malaria case management with regard to diagnosis and treatment. In order to"
"but should be combined with effective communication and respect for patient.Another study in Ghana showed that patients perceived accessibility of RDT kits as an advancement in malaria case management with regard to diagnosis and treatment. In order to achieve and sustain this confidence, a regular supply of ACTs and RDTs is required [55].Stock Monitoring.A study in South Africa highlighted the following factors as having a positive influence on the appropriate use of RDTs: routine stock monitoring such as using stock cards (bin cards, request, and requisition forms) and/or electronic means such as logistic management information system (LMIS) and air-conditioning and monitoring of commodity room temperature with thermometers and regularly updated temperature charts [62].Education.A study conducted in Southeast Nigeria showed that willingness to pay for RDTs increased with education of healthcare users, so that urban patients (who tend to be better educated) were more willing to pay for RDTs more than rural patients [46]. This finding aligns with NDHS 2013, which showed that increase in educational status of women correlates with increased antenatal care by skilled providers and health facility delivery [36]. Although RDTs and ACTs are free in Niger State, increased knowledge of RDTs among the population will facilitate accessibility [53].Social Marketing Increases RDTs Utilization.A study conducted in Uganda from March 2011 to April 2012 demonstrated how a social marketing"
"and ACTs are free in Niger State, increased knowledge of RDTs among the population will facilitate accessibility [53].Social Marketing Increases RDTs Utilization.A study conducted in Uganda from March 2011 to April 2012 demonstrated how a social marketing strategy can be used to increase RDTs utilization. The study took place in 67 villages and involved 92 registered shops. The identified shop owners were trained for RDTs administration and were also tasked with supplying data such as RDTs sales, numbers of positive and negative patients, and fees charged per patient. Monitoring checklists were furnished to shop owners to ensure that RDTs were administered appropriately, sharps and other wastes were handled appropriately, and RDTs were properly integrated in their sales. Following training, each shop owner was equipped with 40 RDTs, sharps disposal box, and free gloves for every RDT purchased. They were also connected with an RDTs wholesaler who subsequently supplied them with RDTs. The result showed that over 2,200 RDTs were sold monthly by trained shop owners over the 6-month period from July to December 2012 [63].4. ConclusionsWith support from NMCP, donors, and implementing agencies, Niger State has made significant progress in malaria control. However, to have the state free of malaria by year 2020 as enshrined in the state governor's \"Niger State Vision 3:2020\" [64], concerted efforts and commitment will be required by the state government.

"progress in malaria control. However, to have the state free of malaria by year 2020 as enshrined in the state governor's \"Niger State Vision 3:2020\" [64], concerted efforts and commitment will be required by the state government. Although parasitological confirmation (using RDTs) of malaria has been officially adopted by Niger State, after almost half a decade the Niger State government still has not procured RDTs. Although the state government does procure ACTs, its supply is like a drop in the ocean.Reliable availability of RDTs and ACTs also impacts acceptance. Commodity stock outages are a common occurrence at health facility supported due to irregular supply. Consumption rate per facility has not been established, and stock management is weak at the peripheral level due to poor adherence to logistic management information systems. When ACTs are out of stock, patients see no reason for testing without treatment.On the part of donors, it is necessary to find out if they understand the programmatic implications of irregular and disproportionate supply of ACTs and RDTs. There may be a need for a formal memorandum of understanding between the state government and donors.There is a general acceptance among the population of finger pricks for RDTs. However, acceptance of the result is an issue, especially when fever is severe.Accessibility to RDTs result is motivated by perception of both patients and health care workers.

"of finger pricks for RDTs. However, acceptance of the result is an issue, especially when fever is severe.Accessibility to RDTs result is motivated by perception of both patients and health care workers. When patient perceived that his/her fever is due to previous mosquito bites, a negative RDT result will not be sufficient to convince the patient. Also, to some healthcare providers, patient symptoms outweigh a negative RDT result.The profit motive of registered private pharmacies (70) and patent medicine vendors (1200) in the state is a force that must be taken into consideration. With them, antimalaria drugs are rarely out of stock, and they are often the patient's first point of contact even before visiting a health facility. Although SFH is implementing GFATM activities at the private sector, still RDTs have not been integrated. This is a major barrier to RDTs implementation in Niger State, as well as other African settings.Investment in RDTs by the state government will be a worthwhile venture, as it has been shown that a large fraction of fever cases presented do not require ACTs.Supply in terms of personnel, commodities, and available health facilities is definitely less than demand for healthcare services including RDTs.Malaria case management data are often from public health facilities. Much activity within the private sector is not captured; the few instances reported are donor funded (GFATM/SFH/SuMAP). Private sector actors that are not supported or recognized"
"RDTs.Malaria case management data are often from public health facilities. Much activity within the private sector is not captured; the few instances reported are donor funded (GFATM/SFH/SuMAP). Private sector actors that are not supported or recognized will not see the need to report data to the state government. Niger State can do simple things such as providing letters of recognition to private health facilities (PMVs and pharmacies), inviting them to stakeholders meetings, capacity building, and distribution of HMIS tools. These will motivate them to report on their activities.5. Recommendations(i)Health workers from nondonor-funded HFs should be trained on diagnosis using RDTs and be supplied with diagnosis and treatment guidelines.(ii)Expand access to malaria RDTs to HMM through awareness campaigns to the community. This should include education and training of RMCs as well as supplying them with RDTs.(iii)To effectively accommodate health workers at lower levels such as health post and RMCs, the guidelines should be translated into local languages for easy understanding.(iv)Establish consumption data on RDTs and ACTs that will inform quantity of commodity required at each level of healthcare and amount required for procurement.(v)Invest in the procurement and proportionate distribution of RDTs to HFs (especially nonfunded HFs) and provide donor-funded RDTs during stock outages.(vi)The state government in collaboration with donors should support capacity building for"
"procurement.(v)Invest in the procurement and proportionate distribution of RDTs to HFs (especially nonfunded HFs) and provide donor-funded RDTs during stock outages.(vi)The state government in collaboration with donors should support capacity building for private HFs' malaria diagnosis using RDTs and cascade RDTs' use through social marketing strategies in the private sector.(vii)Use existing platform (media, health systems, community-based organizations, etc.) to increase awareness and importance of RDTs in the case management of malaria.(viii)Perform continuous supportive supervision, such as visit to health facilities, phone calls, and institutionalized feedback mechanism to increase data quality and malaria case management. Quality data will support forecasting of RDTs and ACTs usage.(ix)Increase information, education, and communication messages to the general public (especially caregivers/women) on prompt response to childhood fever.(x)A sustainability plan should be put in place, should the donors decide to withdraw or reduce support to the state.(xi)Procurement and distribution of RDTs should accompany ACTs and should be in a proportion that will allow invalid results, breakages, and retesting using RDTs.(xii)Donors supporting Niger State should be reminded of WHO and NMCP's guidelines on diagnosis and treatment, so that their commodities should be supplied in proportionate quantity.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsO."

"AbstractDecision tree algorithm is a common classification algorithm in data mining technology, and its results are usually expressed in the form of if-then rules. The C4.5 algorithm is one of the decision tree algorithms, which has the advantages of easy to understand and high accuracy, and the concept of information gain rate is added compared with its predecessor ID3 algorithm. After theoretical analysis, C4.5 algorithm is chosen to analyze the performance appraisal results, and the decision tree for performance appraisal is generated by collecting data, data preprocessing, calculating information gain rate, determining splitting attributes, and postpruning. The system is developed in B/S architecture, and an R&D project management system and platform that can realize performance assessment analysis are built by means of visualization tools, decision tree algorithm, and dynamic web pages. The system includes information storage, task management, report generation, role authority control, information visualization, and other management information system functional modules.

"performance assessment system establishment, report generation of various dimensions, management cockpit construction. With decision tree algorithm as the core technology, the system obtains scientific and reliable project management information with high accuracy and realizes data visualization, which can assist enterprises to establish a good management system in the era of big data.1. IntroductionWith the continuous development and progress of computer technology and big data technology, it provides a lot of new ideas and methods for the management of Internet enterprises [1]. In today's rapid development of the Internet, the use of Internet technology and big data analysis for scientific and effective management of enterprise affairs, increase the core competitiveness of enterprises, promote the progress of the completion of enterprise projects, improve the efficiency and motivation of employees, reduce the cost of operation, and maintenance of enterprises, to build a characteristic management system of Internet enterprises has a vital role [2]. The application of computer and big data technology to enterprise management can fully improve the management efficiency of the enterprise, and more and more Internet enterprises are using various systems for enterprise management, such as Tencent's agile R&D system TAPD and Zen Dao system [3]. These systems can help enterprises manage projects and tasks and assign work to employees. Through these systems, projects can be managed"
"are using various systems for enterprise management, such as Tencent's agile R&D system TAPD and Zen Dao system [3]. These systems can help enterprises manage projects and tasks and assign work to employees. Through these systems, projects can be managed faster and more efficiently. In business management, employee performance appraisal and project cost analysis play a key role in the development of the company [4]. A fair and just evaluation system can improve the motivation of employees, enhance the quality of project completion, and increase the creativity and responsibility of employees. The use of data mining technology, combined with the enterprise project management system, based on the information reported by employees in the system to analyze and evaluate the performance of employees, can help employees to carry out self-planning and provide reference advice for management [5].At the same time, using project management data and performance evaluation results, the cost of the enterprise can be analyzed, and more scientific allocation can be made according to the ability of employees to promote the scientific and sustainable development of the enterprise. R&D project management system is to manage the projects of Internet enterprises engaged in software development [6].

"enterprises engaged in software development [6]. Through this system, project managers plan and manage the tasks involved in software development projects, organize and coordinate the life cycle of a project, and make the project complete its final goal efficiently through an effective management system [7]. In this paper, we use the decision tree algorithm in data mining to analyze the performance appraisal results generated by employees in the system and generate a decision tree to analyze the decision tree, which can help employees understand the focus of performance appraisal, make further planning for their own work, and improve work efficiency [8]. At the same time, the decision tree can directly generate the performance appraisal results of employees, which can reduce the workload of enterprise managers in the future, and also make the performance appraisal more fair and transparent, and mobilize the motivation of enterprise employees [9]. Based on the performance appraisal results, employees are rewarded, punished, and rated, and their remuneration is determined and combined with the expenses in project management, the reports of each dimension of the enterprise are generated and displayed in a visual form, which makes the costs of the enterprise clearer and helps the leadership of the enterprise to understand the situation of the enterprise, so as to formulate the next strategy and reasonably allocate the work of employees according to their abilities, thus to"
"makes the costs of the enterprise clearer and helps the leadership of the enterprise to understand the situation of the enterprise, so as to formulate the next strategy and reasonably allocate the work of employees according to their abilities, thus to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise market [10]. Decision tree algorithm, as a common algorithm in data mining, is also widely used in many fields. Its development process is very long from simple to complex, from simple to deep. In 1966, Hunt developed a concept learning system for learning individual concepts, which was an early inductive learning system for decision trees [11].Research on decision tree algorithms is continuing with the aim of improving the accuracy of decision tree algorithms and combining them with related techniques in other fields to generate more benefits. Decision tree algorithms are widely used in education, performance appraisal, research, and other fields. In China, there is a need for deeper research and development in this area. In this paper, we use the lightweight MVVM framework Vue.js, combined with C# language, SQL Server database, JavaScript assembly language, and other development technologies to develop and design the R&D project management system. Based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, the data set generated in the system is trained and analyzed to generate a decision tree related to performance evaluation.

"management system. Based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, the data set generated in the system is trained and analyzed to generate a decision tree related to performance evaluation. Through testing and analysis of the decision tree, we find out the points that the project leader pays attention to when scoring the performance appraisal and form a complete performance appraisal system based on the performance appraisal attributes in the system and the decision tree. Visualization tools are used to generate enterprise-related cost reports. Through the management of projects, tasks, and employees, the system realizes project management functions such as project creation and management, task flow, employee information filling and management, performance appraisal system establishment, report generation of each dimension, and management cockpit construction. This paper uses the C4.5 decision tree algorithm as the core technology to obtain high-precision performance assessment results and efficient project management system, visualize cost data based on system data, and assist enterprises to establish a good management system and performance assessment system. Through these systems, projects can be managed faster and more efficiently. In business management, employee performance appraisal and project cost analysis play a key role in the development of the company.2.

"In business management, employee performance appraisal and project cost analysis play a key role in the development of the company.2. Related WorkThe current project management level is not high, the procedure is complicated, difficult to operate, and far from the developed countries, there are many loopholes in the market management, and the quality of the system varies, usually using C/S mode, which cannot realize the project information network query; or the project management products are too targeted, not much innovative content, and require secondary development of customized methods to meet the individual needs of enterprise project management [12]. In the project management industry, Wenpu and Huateng are leading in China; however, in the face of increasing innovation and competition, they are not flexible enough to meet their needs, and there is a certain risk of project implementation due to the instability and low technical ability of the enterprise personnel in China. For example, the project management system of financial enterprises in China is outsourced for custom development or developed in-house, and there are few ways to purchase standard software [13]. At present, the application of China's project management system is relatively backward, the large-scale use of the Internet for system management is after 2010, and at the same time, China's existing major project management software are task-centered and rarely focus on the management of staff performance"
"system is relatively backward, the large-scale use of the Internet for system management is after 2010, and at the same time, China's existing major project management software are task-centered and rarely focus on the management of staff performance and the lack of cost analysis. Therefore, the research on the R&D project management system of Internet enterprises in China is inadequate, and the way of performance assessment in China is too backward [14].The researcher quantified a set of performance appraisal systems based on the K-means algorithm by combining decision tree algorithm and cluster analysis to realize a quantitative performance appraisal system, which can achieve a scientific and objective evaluation of the performance appraisal of the enterprise employees. The researcher researched and developed the system by using the ID3 decision tree algorithm for employee performance evaluation and introduced the concept of decision scheduling in the ID3 decision tree algorithm, which effectively reduces the complexity of the algorithm [15]. At present, China is paying more and more attention to the application method of performance appraisal and is working together to realize a fair, scientific, and effective performance appraisal system. For data mining algorithms, although China started late, in recent years, it has made very significant achievements, in the Internet industry, financial industry, meteorological analysis, e-commerce, and other fields [16].

"appraisal system. For data mining algorithms, although China started late, in recent years, it has made very significant achievements, in the Internet industry, financial industry, meteorological analysis, e-commerce, and other fields [16]. And major universities have also invested a lot of energy to further explore the value of the method and more in-depth study of the principles of these algorithms. For example, researchers have applied the ID3 decision tree algorithm to the human resource system to support the company's strategic decision-making, and researchers have applied the ID3 algorithm to the performance evaluation of employees in research institutes, as well as the data mining algorithm mentioned in the previous paragraph to the generation of the performance evaluation system [17].The application and research of these algorithms have accelerated the development of project management systems in China and provided a very scientific and effective method for generating a good performance system. Based on the analysis of the application of decision tree algorithm and performance appraisal system in China, data mining algorithms have been applied to various management systems in China [18]. According to the previous research, combined with the existing project management system and performance appraisal system in China, the application of decision tree algorithm to performance appraisal can improve the fairness and efficiency of performance appraisal evaluation and help"
"combined with the existing project management system and performance appraisal system in China, the application of decision tree algorithm to performance appraisal can improve the fairness and efficiency of performance appraisal evaluation and help enterprises to manage better. Foreign project management software started earlier and developed very quickly. The earliest U.S. Army managed the Manhattan Project through project management technology and achieved very good results. At present, project management software in foreign countries has been introduced through algorithms and other ways to improve the traditional management methods, and through practical proof and standardization of research, the establishment of a complete project management knowledge system [19].At present, the more popular project management software abroad is Microsoft Project, with task allocation, progress tracking, budget management, and workload analysis. In the software development industry, project management systems have long been used by some of the larger software development companies in Europe and the United States [20]. The overall development of foreign performance appraisal system is earlier than China and ahead of domestic. Foreign countries have always attached great importance to the development of the performance appraisal system, and its scientificity, fairness, and reasonableness of evaluation have formed a large gap with China.

"countries have always attached great importance to the development of the performance appraisal system, and its scientificity, fairness, and reasonableness of evaluation have formed a large gap with China. Through the method of data mining, performance appraisal is analyzed and combined with big data and the Internet, and a typical example is PeopleSoft [21]. Through comparative research, it is found that a very complete performance appraisal system has been gradually generated abroad, which has improved the essentials of performance appraisal and made the development of enterprises gradually scientific and simple. The developed countries such as Europe and the United States are making use of the increasingly developed Internet technology and big data technology to improve the performance appraisal methods with the progress of the market and to continuously improve the performance appraisal methods according to the current corporate strategies.3.

"the development of databases, the management of data has become more and more complex, and the amount of data generated has become larger and larger. In this context, data mining technology was developed to extract information from data that we need but are difficult to find. This method is now widely used in production management, scientific exploration, market analysis, and engineering design. Data mining is a cross-disciplinary discipline involving a variety of disciplines, mainly the integration of artificial intelligence, database, statistics, visualization technology, and other disciplines to collect and mine the data to obtain some useful information, which can help decision-makers to make the right judgment and reduce unnecessary risks. The main steps are shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointData mining steps.Data preparation is to collect and organize the information to be mined and in practice to collect the data for your own purposes or to construct your own data from the collected data sets. Data integration is the processing of the collected data according to the user's needs and understanding the characteristics of the field, mainly the missing parts of the data and the cleaning of the dirty data in the data. The next step is data selection, i.e., the selection of data in the database and the identification of the set of data to be analyzed to narrow the scope of processing and improve the quality of data mining.

"data in the data. The next step is data selection, i.e., the selection of data in the database and the identification of the set of data to be analyzed to narrow the scope of processing and improve the quality of data mining. Data preprocessing is to clean the data through statistics, algorithm analysis, and other methods, to remove unnecessary noise data, to get the valid and standardized data set we want, to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data set. Data mining firstly determines the target, that is, the type of knowledge to be discovered, then selects a suitable data mining algorithm according to the determined target, uses the algorithm to correlate or classify the data set, extracts the relevant knowledge, and finally expresses it in some form. Finally, the extracted knowledge is analyzed, and the useful information is extracted from the knowledge and displayed through visualization tools. The main methods of data mining are classification, valuation, prediction, association rules, and clustering, where classification, valuation, and prediction are guided data mining, which can build a model that can describe specific attributes through data, and association rules and clustering analysis are unguided data mining, which use all attributes to find a certain relationship.

Different data mining methods have their own data mining algorithms, such as decision tree algorithm for classification, regression analysis for prediction, and K-means clustering for clustering, which are described in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointData mining algorithm classification chart.The algorithm used in this paper is the decision tree algorithm in the classification algorithm. Among the data mining classification algorithms, the decision tree classification method has the advantage of being easy to understand and does not require too much specialized background knowledge compared to other classification methods. The results generated by decision trees are usually expressed in the form of if-then rules, which are clear and simple, and are widely used in many fields such as financial industry, meteorological analysis, and traffic management. The root node represents an attribute of the tree, the leaves represent the classification tokens, and the branches represent the output results. The method starts from the root node and iterates through the tree, assigning instances to its children based on the results of the test. Each child node takes a value for that feature and continues to test and assign instances through the recursive method until it reaches the leaf node, where the instances are finally assigned to the class of the leaf node. In the decision tree, there are two kinds of"
"takes a value for that feature and continues to test and assign instances through the recursive method until it reaches the leaf node, where the instances are finally assigned to the class of the leaf node. In the decision tree, there are two kinds of data sets: sample data set and test data set. The sample data set is a collection of data in which the attributes and classifications are known, and the algorithm is used to train the sample data set to produce the corresponding decision tree. The test dataset is used to test the generated decision tree, bring the data into the decision tree, derive the final categories, compare with the actual types, and measure the accuracy of the decision tree. A decision tree algorithm is efficient, easy to understand, computationally small, and good at handling discrete data. A decision tree can be judged based on its correctness, its effectiveness after testing the sample data set, and its complexity, indirectness, and scale. Information entropy is a key element of decision tree algorithms, where the word \"entropy\" is a word used in thermodynamics and represents a measure of the degree of chaos in a system in physics. In 1948, Shannon, the father of information theory, borrowed the concept of entropy and introduced information entropy, which is defined as the probability of occurrence of discrete random events. Generally speaking, the higher the probability of a message appearing, the more it is cited, and the lower the information"
"concept of entropy and introduced information entropy, which is defined as the probability of occurrence of discrete random events. Generally speaking, the higher the probability of a message appearing, the more it is cited, and the lower the information entropy, the higher the probability of the message appearing. The formula for calculating information entropy is defined as follows:(1)Decision tree algorithms usually consist of three steps: feature selection, decision tree generation, and decision tree pruning. Commonly used decision tree algorithms include the ID3 algorithm and C4.5 algorithm based on maximum information gain rate which is improved from the ID3 algorithm, and CART based on Gini index.3.2. Model Optimization of Decision Tree ModelThe algorithm is based on the concept of information gain for the selection of classification attributes of the decision tree. The value of information gain is the difference between the impurity level of the sample data before classification and the impurity level after classification. The ID3 algorithm is based on information theory and uses information entropy and information gain as criteria to classify existing data sets. When constructing the decision tree, the information gain is taken into account for each branch node selection. The information gain of all attributes is calculated and compared, and the attribute with the largest information gain is taken as the splitting attribute, and the subsequent leaf nodes continue to"
"is taken into account for each branch node selection. The information gain of all attributes is calculated and compared, and the attribute with the largest information gain is taken as the splitting attribute, and the subsequent leaf nodes continue to cycle through this operation to generate the decision tree. ID3 algorithm can only work on discrete attributes, and the first step is to calculate the information entropy of the target attribute of the dataset using formula H(X), and the second step is to calculate the expected information of a certain attribute of the dataset, assuming that the total classification is A, which can be divided into The second step is to calculate the expected information of an attribute of the dataset, assuming that the total number of categories is A, which can be divided intoncategories, and the probability of each category is P(C1), P(C2), ..., P(Cn), and then, the information entropy of attribute A after partitioning is as follows:(2)The third step requires the information gain, which is the difference between the information entropy obtained in the first step and the information entropy obtained in the second step for attributeC. The formula is as follows:(3)The higher the information gain, the more suitable the attribute is for classification, and the attribute is selected as the current node. The columns of the attribute are eliminated from the list, and the rest of the data are iterated from the first step. When there is only one value"
"the more suitable the attribute is for classification, and the attribute is selected as the current node. The columns of the attribute are eliminated from the list, and the rest of the data are iterated from the first step. When there is only one value of the target attribute in the classification, or the proportion of all values of the attribute reaches a threshold, the iteration is finished. The final decision tree is generated when the iteration is completed.The C4.5 algorithm discretizes the continuous data as follows: First, all the values of the attribute A are sorted in ascending order to obtain the sequence of attribute values (XA1,XA2, ...,XAN), in which there areN-1 dichotomous methods, i.e., there are N-1 separation thresholds, and the dichotomous method is used to divide this data series into two parts, i.e., two subdata sets (XA1, ...,XAI). The calculation steps of the C4.5 algorithm are generally the same as those of the ID3 algorithm, but the information gain rate of the attributes is added to the information gain, and the process is as follows: first, the splitting information is calculated by assuming that the training data setXis divided intoisubdatasets by the value ofAattribute,XjXjdenotes the number of samples in thejth subdataset, andXis the number of samples in the original dataset, and the splitting information of attribute A can be obtained as follows:(4)Then, the information gain of the sample set after splitting according to attributeAis given"
"of samples in thejth subdataset, andXis the number of samples in the original dataset, and the splitting information of attribute A can be obtained as follows:(4)Then, the information gain of the sample set after splitting according to attributeAis given by(5)Information gain rate of the sample set after attributeAsplitting is(6)After the C4.5 algorithm is executed, the result of the information gain rate of all attributes is obtained, and the attribute with the highest information gain rate is selected as the split attribute of the current node. The other attributes will continue to be computed recursively. As the attributes are gradually computed, the information gain rate becomes smaller and smaller, and the attribute with the relatively larger information gain rate is selected as the classification attribute. The flowchart of C4.5 is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointAlgorithm flowchart.3.3. Decision Tree PruningThe training sample is a key factor in decision tree building, and when the training sample is too small or there are problems with the data, the resulting decision tree may be anomalous, which may lead to inaccurate decision trees and may make the decision tree very complex. According to the research, not all complex and large decision trees result in more accurate rule sets. Therefore, complex decision trees need to be simplified, which is called pruning.

"the research, not all complex and large decision trees result in more accurate rule sets. Therefore, complex decision trees need to be simplified, which is called pruning. Prepruning occurs during the construction of the decision tree when the growth is terminated early in the computation process, and pruning is performed. Prepruning is simple, but it is difficult to determine the timing of termination during the growth of the decision tree, which makes it not very practical. The general decision tree algorithm uses postpruning. Postpruning is performed on a fully grown decision tree in a bottom-up manner, replacing node subtrees with leaf nodes that do not meet the confidence level, and labeling the class with the most frequently used class in the node subtree. The pruning step is repeated until all the nodes satisfy the condition, and the final generated decision tree is more reliable than the previous decision tree. Compared to prepruning, postpruning reduces many perceived interventions. The common postpruning methods are CCP (cost complexity pruning), REP (reduced error pruning), PEP (pessimistic error pruning), and MEP (minimum error pruning). In the comparative study of several pruning methods, it is found that PEP pruning is a top-down pruning method, which has the highest accuracy among several pruning methods and does not require a separate pruning data set.At present, most of the existing project management information systems are developed and designed using B/S"
"is a top-down pruning method, which has the highest accuracy among several pruning methods and does not require a separate pruning data set.At present, most of the existing project management information systems are developed and designed using B/S architecture, which is a browser-server architecture model, and users generally access the system through a browser. B/S system has the advantages of easy maintenance and upgrade, low cost, security, etc. The front end uses Vue.js, a bottom-up progressive MVVM framework for building user interfaces, and the back end uses C#, an object-oriented development language derived from C++. MVC is an abbreviation for Model-View-Controller, which is a framework for layering systems, separating business logic, data, and display interfaces. The framework is layered on the system, and the business logic, data, and display interface is separated, to more clearly delineate their respective functions. The model layer is usually used to handle the logical part of the application data, generally responsible for access to the database. The view layer is the display layer, which handles the display part of the data and is created based on the model data. The controller layer is the user interaction part, which reads data from the view layer, controls user input, and sends it to the model layer.MVC framework has the advantages of low coupling, high reusability, low life cycle cost, high maintainability, and fast deployment.

"part, which reads data from the view layer, controls user input, and sends it to the model layer.MVC framework has the advantages of low coupling, high reusability, low life cycle cost, high maintainability, and fast deployment. However, it increases the complexity of the system structure and implementation, and for some simple pages, using MVC framework may lead to the reduction of its operational efficiency; at the same time, there may be inefficient access of view to model; the close connection between view and controller will lead to their independent reuse. MVVM framework is the abbreviation of Model-View-ViewModel, which is an improved version based on MVC framework and MVP framework. This makes it very difficult to maintain the MVC pattern. This is because the controller for processing logic and data transformation in complex projects becomes very large and difficult to maintain, so in order to change the limitations of this model, the logic processing and data transformation of the controller are stripped out from it, and a special object, ViewModel, is created to manage these operations. This approach makes the controller code become very small and easy to manage. This makes the MVVM framework as the mainstream framework used in software development at this stage.4.

Optimization Analysis Based on Decision Tree AlgorithmA fair and responsible appraisal system will stimulate the motivation of the employees, improve the efficiency and motivation of the employees, and enhance the competitiveness of the enterprise. Today, with the rapid development of the Internet, performance appraisal through data mining will become a new way. When an employee submits a task using this system, the system will record the time of task completion and the number of codes submitted by the employee, and the project manager will evaluate the employee based on the information submitted by the employee. Using these data, we analyze the employee's performance through decision tree algorithm to get the employee's performance appraisal results, so that the company can guide the employee's work and help the employee to improve his or her quality, and also improve the technical strength of the company. Before data mining, we first determine the sample data, and the data are selected from the system project management function in the company online, the information filled in by employees and the staff assessment scores entered by managers. As the company is a software development company, the data were mainly collected from R&D workers in the company. 270 data were collected, 180 of which were used as the training data set for the decision tree algorithm, and the rest were used as the test data set.

"company, the data were mainly collected from R&D workers in the company. 270 data were collected, 180 of which were used as the training data set for the decision tree algorithm, and the rest were used as the test data set. The data set is mainly from the system's employee information table, the employee's work situation according to the task, and the manager's evaluation of the employee during the time period. Employee information table: it is mainly the information of the employees when they registered in the system, among which the performance evaluation criteria are as follows: name, department, major, degree, etc. Work status: this data set is determined by the submission of employee task cards, such as the number of codes submitted, the filling of hours, the completion of work, and the efficiency of work completion, etc. These data are automatically calculated by the system after the employee fills in the data and stored in different tables of the system, and summarized by SQL statements. Employee evaluation: These data are evaluated by the project management according to the performance of the subordinate employees. This process of integrating data is called data integration. The data are aggregated by the unique ID of the employee in the system and stored in the performance appraisal table with the structure as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance appraisal changes.In the process of getting the data set, there are many data with null"
"of the employee in the system and stored in the performance appraisal table with the structure as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance appraisal changes.In the process of getting the data set, there are many data with null value. For these data, we judge the data before entering the variable value into the system database and prohibit the data from appearing as null. Many of the above variable values are extracted from other database tables in the system, and when we get these data, we will fill the null values before entering, and the filling rules are as follows: code amount: these data are null, which means the employee has no code submission record in this time period, and it is recorded as 0 value. The data are empty, which means the employee did not fill in the hours during this time period. Since the filling rate is related to the employee's attendance, if it is empty, the employee can find his attendance records in the attendance sheet and calculate the percentage to be filled in. Learning ability, technical ability, work efficiency: if these data are empty, the employee's supervisor has not evaluated him/her, and the default evaluation is middle-grade C. In the process of data acquisition, there will be some random errors or mistakes, which we call noisy data. The appearance of noisy data can cause great errors in the data mining results.

"there will be some random errors or mistakes, which we call noisy data. The appearance of noisy data can cause great errors in the data mining results. Therefore, we need to preprocess the noisy data; usually, the methods to deal with noisy data are as follows: regression, boxing, human-computer combination check, clustering, etc. For example, when the code volume data are abnormal, the average value of the data can be used to replace the noise data. In addition, we can also use the principle of multiple regression algorithms to smooth the noise data. In this paper, we will use different methods to deal with the noise data according to the attribute values. Since the decision tree algorithm cannot handle continuous values, it is necessary to discretize the continuous variables before data mining, as shown in Figure5. Through testing and analysis of the decision tree, we find out the points that the project leader pays attention to when scoring the performance appraisal, and we form a complete performance appraisal system based on the performance appraisal attributes in the system and the decision tree.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointConsecutive values of the work-filling rate.In this paper, we take the report of the company's employees using this system in a certain month of 2019, and according to the above data processing process, we get the data set in Figure6, and the data in the table are taken from the performance appraisal scores of 30 employees in the company's"
"employees using this system in a certain month of 2019, and according to the above data processing process, we get the data set in Figure6, and the data in the table are taken from the performance appraisal scores of 30 employees in the company's software development department in January 2019, and in the actual calculation process, we will take the data of 30 employees in this department in the first half of 2019 for the decision tree algorithm. In the actual calculation process, we will take the data of 30 employees in the department in the first half of 2019 for the calculation of the decision tree algorithm and 90 data in the third quarter of 2019 for testing the results of the decision tree algorithm. The system can automatically generate decision trees based on the data set, and through the analysis of the decision trees, we can find out the modules that managers are concerned about in the performance appraisal--the amount of code and the completion of work. These data are derived from the information reported by employees in the system, which requires employees to plan their tasks in their daily work, complete them on time, and report their costs to the system in a timely manner. The generated decision tree algorithm is recorded by the system and used for the evaluation of the performance appraisal afterward.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointAlgorithm training data set.The objective of this example is the final evaluation result of the performance appraisal, and"

In the 180 extracted data sets, the 4 values are as follows: 59, 92, 25, and 4.In this example, there are 6 attributes as splitting possibilities, and the information entropy of each attribute can be calculated by equation (2).

When the value is master's degree, there are 36 data, as shown in Figure7, among which the samples belonging to the four types are as follows: 19, 11, 5, and 1, thenI(19, 11, 5, 1)â€‰=â€‰1.5484â€‰bits, from which we can get its information entropy when the attribute is education:H(education)â€‰=â€‰144/180âˆ—. When the attribute is code, there are 4 kinds of values, when the value isA, and there are 36 data, and the samples are 24, 12, 0, and 0. Then, we haveI(24, 12, 0, 0)â€‰=â€‰0.87218â€‰bits and 0.

After each project is created, members of the project need to create multiple tasks within the project. The types of tasks can be created by the system administrator. The task package also needs to estimate the cost to be consumed under this module. After the task is created, the project team members who need to complete the task should create task cards under the task, which are defined as short-term plans and goals for the project members in the process of completing the task. Employee management module is the core of this paper, and the key function of the research is the employee performance appraisal system based on decision tree calculation. In the employee management module, firstly, the employees create their own accounts and fill in the information. Then, the system administrator fills in the employee's organization and other information of the employee.There are two kinds of staff management, one is the project manager's management of subordinate staff, and the other is the staff's self-management.

"kinds of staff management, one is the project manager's management of subordinate staff, and the other is the staff's self-management. First of all, employees can assign their own tasks and establish their own cards in the system, and there is a personal workbench in the system, where employees can view their own tasks and cards and self-manage the status of the task cards. Under the workbench, employees can fill in their working hours and view their weekly and monthly reports. The performance appraisal module is a submodule of the staff management module, which generates the three key information of code volume, work completion, and work completion rate based on the information reported by the staff in the system, and the project manager needs to evaluate the learning ability and technical ability of the staff based on their usual performance in the system. These indicators are used to generate the performance evaluation decision tree. The system requires the project leader to give the final rating of the employee's performance appraisal. After the raw data are available, the system generates a decision tree related to the performance appraisal based on the data set, which helps the employee understand the areas that need to be improved.

ConclusionIn this paper, from the perspective of project management, the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, which is an outstanding data mining technique, is used for performance evaluation analysis. Firstly, we collect and process the information related to the performance of software R&D project leaders and employees to form a performance dataset, and then generate a decision tree model related to performance appraisal based on this dataset through data reprocessing, attribute splitting, model building, pruning operation, and evaluation analysis. The decision tree model was tested with the test dataset generated by the system, and the accuracy rate reached more than 90%, which is higher than the decision tree result of the ID3 algorithm. Based on the analysis of the decision tree, we can identify the areas that need to be improved in the software development work and provide a reference for the performance evaluation of project managers. On the other hand, the information about project management and the evaluation of employee performance in the system will have an impact on the cost of the company. Based on this information, cost reports can be generated for the company. The reports are visualized in a multi-dimensional way to show the cost of the company.

"of pregnancy (HDP) are important causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality globally. They include pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and the HELLP (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) syndrome. A World Health Organisation (WHO) systematic review concluded that with 50 000 annual deaths, hypertensive disorders are one of the major causes of maternal mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In that report, HDP were the third leading cause of maternal deaths (9.1%) in Africa and the leading cause of death in Latin America and the Caribbean accounting for 25.7% of mortality1.The underlying causes of HDP are not fully understood but hypothesised to be related to poor placentation and feto-maternal interactions2. A number of individual risk factors are known to be associated with the condition3,4including maternal age, obesity, ethnicity, nulliparity, multiple pregnancy, diabetes mellitus and family history of hypertension or PIH.In Ghana, HDP are the third leading cause of maternal deaths (9%) after haemorrhage (22%) and induced abortion (11%)5. However the incidence of HDP does not appear to be uniform across the country. The Ghana Maternal Health Survey conducted in 2007 found that in highly urbanised Accra, the capital city, HDP were more common, accounting for 19% of all maternal deaths5. A retrospective study of maternal deaths at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana between"
"Survey conducted in 2007 found that in highly urbanised Accra, the capital city, HDP were more common, accounting for 19% of all maternal deaths5. A retrospective study of maternal deaths at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana between January 2008 and June 2010 found that HDP were the leading cause of institutional mortality, accounting for 26.4% of all maternal deaths6, and having overtaken haemorrhage as the major cause of death in pregnant women.There is very little information about the extent of and the reasons why there would be rural, urban and other geographical area variation in the incidence and prevalence of the condition in sub-Saharan African countries. It is possible that in addition to individual factors, there may be environmental and contextual risk factors such as urbanisation and lifestyle factors associated with the condition.Observations of variations in the incidence and prevalence of HDP are not new, but the data are mainly from other parts of the world. A WHO study on the geographical variation of the incidence of hypertension in pregnancy in Asia found that it varied by a factor of 25 between countries7. The study concluded that there are genuine differences in the incidence of HDP in the populations of South East Asia and that these are not caused by underlying differences in the baseline blood pressures (BP) in these populations. A similar study is not available for sub-Saharan Africa or for individual countries within the region"
"in the populations of South East Asia and that these are not caused by underlying differences in the baseline blood pressures (BP) in these populations. A similar study is not available for sub-Saharan Africa or for individual countries within the region despite it being important to understand the extent of any geographical variations in HDP prevalence and factors contributing to such variation. It has implications for the development and implementation of clinical and programmatic interventions that can contribute to the reduction of HDP to maternal, foetal and newborn morbidity and mortality.Antenatal and delivery data management at the health facility level in GhanaAll antenatal and delivery information in Ghana is kept in the individual maternal health record book of each woman. This includes personal information and information on services received including laboratory results. The maternal record books are not retained in the clinic as the women take them home with the advice to carry them to any clinic they may need to visit. At each visit, the attending nurses at the antenatal clinic (ANC) and labour wards enter key information about the woman's care into the antenatal register or the delivery register. Which of the data entered into the maternal health record book is extracted into the antenatal and the delivery register is determined at the national level and conveyed to frontline staff in all health facilities.

"of the data entered into the maternal health record book is extracted into the antenatal and the delivery register is determined at the national level and conveyed to frontline staff in all health facilities. It is also integrated into the design of the antenatal and delivery registers. Thus any patient information, which is not required to be entered into these registers, is effectively lost to routine health management information system (HMIS) data once patients leave the clinic with their records.The availability of high quality routine HMIS data can make mapping of local area variations in the incidence of a condition such as PIH, as well as tracking changes over time, a relatively simple task. It is however, uncertain whether the quality of the routine HMIS data permits its use for such a purpose. We decided to carry out an initial exploration to answer some of these questions.Aims of the studyOur study had two aims. The first was to assess the availability and completeness of district and facility level routine HMIS data in Ghana that would enable a mapping of PIH incidence on a routine basis. The second was to describe the extent to which the data allow to study variation in the incidence of PIH between urban and rural districts in Ghana and explore some of the possible maternal, contextual and environmental factors that might explain these variations.For the second aim, we hypothesised that there are statistically significant variations in incidence of PIH across"
"rural districts in Ghana and explore some of the possible maternal, contextual and environmental factors that might explain these variations.For the second aim, we hypothesised that there are statistically significant variations in incidence of PIH across regions and districts in Ghana with the incidence of PIH being higher in highly urbanised areas compared to less urbanised and rural areas. We further theorised that these variations would possibly be explained in part by a higher prevalence of obesity in higher incidence PIH geographical localities. This is because urbanisation is often accompanied by changes in critical lifestyle factors known to favour the development of obesity.MethodsThe study was a retrospective record review of ANC and delivery records of 2682 pregnant women using district hospitals in the Greater Accra (n= 1578) and Upper West (n= 1104) regions of Ghana in the first half of 2012. We used ANC records since based on community surveys and routine HMIS data we consider that they are reasonably representative of the population of pregnant women in the community.With regard to ANC coverage rates, the Ghana Maternal Health Survey, 20075reported ANC coverage for the various regions in Ghana ranging from 91.7% to 98.7% and reported ANC coverage of 96.4% and 94.3% for the Greater Accra and the Upper West regions, respectively. The 2008 and the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health surveys8,9providing aggregate regional data, show over 95% ANC attendance across"
"91.7% to 98.7% and reported ANC coverage of 96.4% and 94.3% for the Greater Accra and the Upper West regions, respectively. The 2008 and the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health surveys8,9providing aggregate regional data, show over 95% ANC attendance across the country, including the two regions studied. Routine HMIS data of the Ghana Health Service similarly show over 95% ANC attendance at the aggregate regional level. Routine Ghana Health Service data on district level show district by district variation ranging from 56.4% to 135.5% in the Upper West region and 45.4% to 172.1% in the Greater Accra region10. The district by district variation in ANC coverage is in part accounted for by women crossing borders to use clinics in neighbouring districts rather than lower community-based use rates of antenatal care, resulting in ANC coverage rates exceeding 100% for some districts.For all pregnant women, individual patient data were obtained for the first ANC visit to give baseline characteristics of the women at the onset of their pregnancy and for subsequent ANC visits to delivery where available. To facilitate explanation of the findings, observation within the clinics and unstructured discussions and conversations with the staff were also conducted.We purposively selected the Greater Accra and the Upper West regions for the conduct of this study based on the Ghana Statistical Service data that showed that Greater Accra is the most urbanised region in Ghana (90.5% urbanisation)"
