"a historical and comprehensive data set used to analyze and process data according to actual needs. The second step is to prune the decision tree: pruning the decision tree is the process of analyzing and changing the decision tree created in the previous step. It is mainly used to verify the initial rules created in the process of constructing the decision tree and the data in the new sample set (called the test data set), and it will remove the branches that affect the accuracy of the prediction.4.4. Bayesian MethodA Bayesian network is a probabilistic reasoning method, which can effectively infer and process incomplete and uncertain data. It can also effectively deal with incomplete and noisy data sets and solve the inconsistency and freedom of data. Bayesian classification is a statistical classification method that can predict the probability of class members. It uses the values in sampling features to calculate the probability of a sample falling into a specific category, and then, it assigns the sample to the most probable category. Bayesian classification shows high accuracy and speed when applied to large databases [9].4.5. Method Based on Rough SetAs a convenient calculation method, the original column does not require additional information. For example, the probability distribution in statistics and the membership degree of fuzzy columns can simplify data and obtain knowledge based on the information provided by the data.

"require additional information. For example, the probability distribution in statistics and the membership degree of fuzzy columns can simplify data and obtain knowledge based on the information provided by the data. It can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods of processing uncertain information, and it can be combined with it to obtain more accurate results, which can improve the ability to deal with uncertain and incomplete information. The original set method first separates the value of the attributes in the information system through estimation and then divides each attribute into equivalence classes and then uses the equivalence relations in the set to subtract the attributes in the information system and finally obtains the minimum decision-making relation. The current relational database management system and the new data warehouse management system have laid a solid foundation for original data mining.5. Association Rule Mining Algorithm and Its Application in Teaching Management Evaluation5.1. Association Rule Mining-Related Algorithms5.1.1. Apriori algorithmThe Apriori algorithm is an algorithm for mining association rules. It uses the idea of two-stage mining, and it is executed based on multiple scans of the transaction database. In the first traversal, calculate the frequency set of data items with all elements of 1, and iteratively perform the following steps: connect the results obtained from thek-th traversal, return the lengthk+ 1, and setk+ 1"
"of the transaction database. In the first traversal, calculate the frequency set of data items with all elements of 1, and iteratively perform the following steps: connect the results obtained from thek-th traversal, return the lengthk+ 1, and setk+ 1 frequent items to be retained. At the end of each traversal, if it is found that no frequency set has been created in this traversal, stop. Therefore, the Apriori algorithm must pass a set of transactionsc+ 1 times, wherecis the number of elements in the longest frequency set [10]. The algorithm idea of Apriori algorithm is simple and easy to implement. It uses a recursive statistical algorithm to generate a continuous element set, which greatly reduces the size of the continuous element set and this can obtain good performance. But the Apriori algorithm also has obvious shortcomings. First of all, some transaction items in the Apriori algorithm can be judged after the first scan that there is no need to scan again, but the results are scanned multiple times, which greatly reduces the efficiency of the algorithm. During the scanning operation, the database must be reanalyzed for each iteration. When calculating the support of the candidate set, a complete scan is always performed from the beginning of the transaction database, which will cause multiple repeated scans. The traditional Apriori algorithm generates a large number of candidate sets when solving frequent 2-item sets, which increases the computational complexity of"
"from the beginning of the transaction database, which will cause multiple repeated scans. The traditional Apriori algorithm generates a large number of candidate sets when solving frequent 2-item sets, which increases the computational complexity of the algorithm. In addition, the Apriori algorithm creates a large number of continuous sets. Due to the large amount of data, more candidate name sets can be created. When there are 1000 frequent 1-itemsetsI, the number of candidate 2-itemsets will exceed 1 million, which is an exponential growth. These have high requirements on the running time and running space of the machine, which makes the execution efficiency of the algorithm very low [11].However, the Apriori algorithm still has some shortcomings that need to be improved. Details are as follows:(1)Some transaction items in the Apriori algorithm can be judged after the first scan that there is no need to scan again, but the result is scanned multiple times. This greatly reduces the efficiency of the algorithm. In response to this problem, the researchers proposed an improved method, specifically: when the Apriori algorithm generatesk-item frequent itemsets, remove some infrequent itemsets, so as not to combine them into candidates again to remove some special transaction records. The counting problem is no longer considered when generating (k+ 1)-item frequent itemsets(2)The traditional Apriori algorithm always performs a complete scan from the beginning of the transaction"
"again to remove some special transaction records. The counting problem is no longer considered when generating (k+ 1)-item frequent itemsets(2)The traditional Apriori algorithm always performs a complete scan from the beginning of the transaction database when calculating the support of the candidate set, which will cause multiple repeated scans. Therefore, researchers have proposed a dynamic pattern counting DIC algorithm, which sets markers to divide the database. It inserts a new candidate set generated each time at any starting point, and when scanning a candidate set later, it stops scanning until it encounters a position where the candidate set already exists. Therefore, the algorithm scans the database less times than the Apriori algorithm(3)The traditional Apriori algorithm generates many candidate sets when solving frequent 2-itemsets, which increases the computational complexity of the algorithm. Therefore, researchers have proposed a DHP algorithm for compressing candidate sets. The DHP algorithm solves frequent itemsets by decomposing the transaction database to construct a hash table. This algorithm drastically reduces the number of candidate sets with the increase of iterations, thus effectively reducing the computational complexity of the algorithmIn this paper, the Apriori algorithm is analyzed in detail. The algorithm can be widely used, and it also has many advantages. The Aprioi algorithm uses a layer-by-layer iterative search method. The algorithm is"
"computational complexity of the algorithmIn this paper, the Apriori algorithm is analyzed in detail. The algorithm can be widely used, and it also has many advantages. The Aprioi algorithm uses a layer-by-layer iterative search method. The algorithm is simple and clear. It does not require complicated theoretical derivation, and it is easy to implement. This algorithm is suitable for association rule mining in transactional databases, and it is also suitable for rare data sets. According to previous research, this algorithm is only suitable for association rule mining of rare data sets, that is, data sets less than a frequency and length.The Aprioi algorithm is mainly composed of two processes: connection and pruning. In connection, assume that the items in the item set are sorted alphabetically. l1 and l2 are any two item sets in Lk-1; the condition that l1 and l2 can be connected is (l1[1] =l2[1])Λ(l1[2] =l2[2])Λ⋯Λ(l1[k− 2] =l2[k− 2])Λ(l1[k− 1] =l2[k− 1]), and the result itemset produced by connecting l1 [1] and l2 [2] isl1[1]l2[2] ⋯ ⋯l1[k− 1]l2[k− 1]. Pruning is mainly to scan the database to determine the support count of each candidate set inC.5.1.2. FP Growth AlgorithmThe FP growth algorithm is an effective algorithm for retrieving frequent itemsets in large databases.

"for retrieving frequent itemsets in large databases. This algorithm does not generate a tedious process of generating candidate sets when exploring frequent element sets but uses a divide-and-conquer method. First, it compresses the database that provides frequent elements into a frequent model tree (FP tree), while it retains information related to the element set. Then, it divides the compressed database into a set of condition databases, each condition database is associated with a frequent item, and each condition database is retrieved separately.The FP growth algorithm compresses the database and provides a set of repeated elements in the repeated model tree. Through two database checks, the frequency of the database is compressed into a complex pattern tree (CE tree) in a descending order according to its mean value, and frequent patterns are obtained by mining the frequent pattern tree. However, there are still performance bottlenecks in the algorithm when constructing the complex model tree. The characteristic of the FP growth algorithm is that it only needs to scan the database twice without creating candidate algorithms. Compared with that of the Apriori algorithm, the FP growth rate performance of this algorithm has been greatly improved, but the FP growth algorithm also has insufficient problems, and more researchers are needed to improve it.However, the FP growth algorithm still has some shortcomings that need to be improved.

"has been greatly improved, but the FP growth algorithm also has insufficient problems, and more researchers are needed to improve it.However, the FP growth algorithm still has some shortcomings that need to be improved. Details are as follows:(1)From the content of this article, we know that the FP growth algorithm compresses all records in the transaction database into a tree (FP tree). The more data content, the larger the content using the FP growth algorithm, so for large databases, it is unrealistic to construct a memory-based FP tree. Therefore, researchers have proposed a method of parallel processing of the database, by segmenting the database data, each segmentation point is individually mined, and finally, the results are merged(2)According to the content of the article, the FP growth algorithm has a performance bottleneck in the process of mining frequent patterns. Therefore, the researchers proposed an improved FP growth algorithm and its distributed parallel implementation. They improved the FP growth algorithm and pruned the complete pattern tree based on the frequent closed pattern itemset strategy to reduce the space search and improve the efficiency of algorithm mining(3)According to the content of this paragraph, the FP growth algorithm is a classic association rule mining algorithm, but its existence query efficiency is low.

"of this paragraph, the FP growth algorithm is a classic association rule mining algorithm, but its existence query efficiency is low. When mining frequent FP tree, it needs to traverse FP tree repeatedly. Aiming at the above shortcomings, a method using two-dimensional tables combined with hash table technology is proposed to improve the traditional FP growth algorithm. The improved algorithm shortens the running time, and the smaller the support, the more obvious this advantage(4)According to the content of the article, the FP growth algorithm needs to scan the database twice to compress the database of frequent itemsets into a frequent pattern tree. If it is a small database, the amount of calculation is not large, but for a large database, the time required to scan twice is very long, and the FP growth algorithm also requires a lot of memory. Therefore, researchers have proposed an improved FP tree frequent itemset mining algorithm. Through the test of database data and a comparative analysis with the traditional FP growth algorithm, it can be seen that the improved FP growth algorithm can save a lot of memory usageThe FP growth algorithm is an effective algorithm for retrieving frequent itemsets in large databases. In this process, the algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer method. Then, the specific steps of the divide and conquer method are as follows: first, scan the entire database to find frequent 1-itemsets, and then sort them according to the sort order of the number"
"process, the algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer method. Then, the specific steps of the divide and conquer method are as follows: first, scan the entire database to find frequent 1-itemsets, and then sort them according to the sort order of the number of endorsements. Use frequent 1-itemsets to create an item header and association based on frequent 1-itemsets in the FP tree in the second step. Point the table 1-itemsets and sort and reset the transaction of the entire database. Secondly, FP tree is composed of \"Null\" as the root point, so the entire database is divided into several conditional databases (projection database type), each database is associated with a frequent item set, and each conditional database is mined.5.1.3. Partition AlgorithmThe algorithm only needs to traverse the set transaction twice. The algorithm first divides the transaction set into multiple blocks so that each block can be loaded into memory. In the first traversal, all blocks are loaded into the memory one by one, and Apriori is used to find the collection of data item frequency sets within the range of each block. Because the search is limited to one block, these data item frequency sets are not the last frequency set of data items. These sets are combined to obtain a superset of the frequency set of a set of data items. In the second traversal, for each data item set obtained in the first traversal, the actual support is calculated. If the support is less than the support specified by the"
"sets are combined to obtain a superset of the frequency set of a set of data items. In the second traversal, for each data item set obtained in the first traversal, the actual support is calculated. If the support is less than the support specified by the user, the data item set is deleted. At the end of the second traversal, a collection of data item frequency sets is obtained.5.1.4. Carma AlgorithmSome existing association rules require users to enter the minimum trust and minimum support before running the mining algorithm. The algorithm needs to run several times to determine whether the minimum confidence and minimum support are too high or too low. The Carma algorithm provides feedback to the user during the operation. Users can adjust the minimum support at any time based on the feedback information. If the user is satisfied with the output, the algorithm can be stopped at any time [12].6. Application of Association Rule Mining Algorithm in Teaching EvaluationIn terms of teaching evaluation, teaching evaluation is an important part of education. It is a guarantee for guiding education, cultivating high-quality talents, helping society to make full use of educational achievements, and promoting the healthy development of education.

"of education. Traditional teaching evaluation is mostly implemented with reference to relevant evaluation index systems and questionnaires, and it pays more attention to the results of evaluation. It is used as a basis for teacher promotion and evaluation. Applying association rules to teaching evaluation data will dig out some useful data, which will guide the teaching process and provide support for managers' decision-making.6.1. Application of Association Rule Mining Algorithm in Student CoursesAs the school continues to expand the scale of enrollment, the scale of teaching has also continued to expand, the expansion of majors has accelerated, and the amount of data has also increased geometrically. It is difficult for teaching administrators and class teachers to find out the relationship between previous courses and subsequent courses directly based on the distribution of student test scores and then make decisions such as making and modifying teaching plans based on this.The correlation analysis of data mining is used here, mainly using association rules to analyze the rationality of the curriculum. For example, according to the analysis of association rules, theAcourse and theBcourse need to be set up in theCcourse. Whether students are unable to understand and accept a certain course, whether the market needs this course, and whether there are special requirements for a certain course, make reasonable arrangements that are conducive to improving student performance"
"Whether students are unable to understand and accept a certain course, whether the market needs this course, and whether there are special requirements for a certain course, make reasonable arrangements that are conducive to improving student performance and employment. It is also possible to set whether theAcourse andBcourse have a contextual arrangement according to the mining mode of association rules, adjust the teaching plan, and promote student learning. It can also be judged based on this that theAcourse should not be arranged with theBcourse. This can avoid the negative effects of arranging two courses together and making students unable to grasp. In this way, the correlation between courses contained in a large amount of data can be effectively discovered, and the correlation between courses and courses can be discovered through data mining of the database in the student performance management system.6.2.

"and appropriately use a variety of strategies and methods to develop modern information technology and information education design. It can organize all links and elements in the learning process scientifically and reasonably. Informatization education planning is known as the core of college teachers' informatization learning ability, which is also the theoretical basis and practical guide for carrying out educational activities under informatization conditions. At the same time, university teachers need to understand a certain educational process.6.2.2. Implementation of Informatization Teaching ManagementUnder the influence of educational ideology in the information age, the specific implementation of information-based learning activities is an important part of college teachers' teaching. The implementation of information-based learning is a broad, professional, and flexible activity. Therefore, in addition to traditional teaching capabilities, it also puts forward requirements for college teachers' educational technology, teaching equipment, and professional experimental equipment. Relevant personnel should use the ability of technology to guide college students to use technology to practice, so that they can effectively manage the teaching and learning process, as well as the ability to express language, the ability to organize the classroom, and the ability to write on the blackboard. In the implementation of information-based learning, it is especially necessary to"
"manage the teaching and learning process, as well as the ability to express language, the ability to organize the classroom, and the ability to write on the blackboard. In the implementation of information-based learning, it is especially necessary to emphasize that in an information-based environment, it is necessary to cultivate the innovative potential of college students, the development and understanding of collaborative learning, and the ability of university teachers to explore learning.6.2.3. Evaluation of Informatization Teaching ManagementInformation-based learning evaluation is one of the most powerful tools for college teachers' self-improvement and professional development. This is one of the most effective ways to understand the effectiveness of teaching and the degree of knowledge gained by students. It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate all aspects of the learning goals set by teachers and students to diagnose and correct problems in the learning process in time. School teachers should make full use of the results of the feedback. Evaluating the informatization of teaching is an important part of teachers' informatization teaching ability in the information age. Prior to this, the concept of educational evaluation has undergone major changes. Due to the limitations of traditional teaching evaluation methods, university teachers cannot do this.

"evaluation has undergone major changes. Due to the limitations of traditional teaching evaluation methods, university teachers cannot do this. There is little or no attention to the educational evaluation process. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate multiple learning evaluations and individual learning evaluations.7. Design of Teaching Management Evaluation System Based on Association Rule Mining Scientific Calculation7.1. Analysis of Big Data Platform ArchitectureThe range of data stored is very wide. In data mining, the choice of fuzzy question will affect the actual value of data mining. Therefore, when designing the system, the functional requirements and various functional modules of the system should be clarified. In the operation process of the management information system, the orderly management and automatic processing of the computer can be used to reduce the waste of manpower and material resources. In this way, paperless office can be realized and a complicated work can be simplified. This can also liberate management personnel, allowing them to concentrate on other related tasks, thereby improving work efficiency and quality. The relevant personnel must fully guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, and consistency of the data, so as to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and dynamics of the various information resources provided by the system in real time. This enables colleges and universities to obtain quality assurance in terms of management administration,"
"of the data, so as to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and dynamics of the various information resources provided by the system in real time. This enables colleges and universities to obtain quality assurance in terms of management administration, logistics education, and teaching [13].The overall management level directly depends on the level of data collection and processing to a certain extent, but the complexity of college data management and the clear and reasonable division of responsibilities are closely linked. Nowadays, accurate and efficient data management methods are indispensable. Improving management transparency and cooperation between different departments requires the same or different departments in different jurisdictions. Employees interact online in real time to achieve common goals or perform their own tasks. Management requirements are the core of this system, so the goal of this system is to achieve key management functions with relatively complete functions.7.2. Feasibility Analysis7.2.1. Timing FeasibilityIn terms of timing and feasibility, the preparation work for the development of the system is sufficient.

If the system is successfully developed, it can make college information management more standardized and rigorous, which will bring more efficient business processing and smarter data analysis and processing to colleges and universities, and make college data analysis and processing more efficient [14].At present, foreign management information systems have been developed relatively well. Many enterprises and scientific research institutions have already used data mining and other related technologies to analyze their internal data through specialized data analysis companies in order to obtain useful information. In contrast, the domestic management information system is still in the development stage, and it is in its infancy in terms of data correlation analysis and useful rule mining. Under such circumstances, China's university informatization management should fully adapt to the needs of development, and relevant personnel should accelerate the informatization process in order to be further improved.7.2.2.

Based on the existing university management information system, the system has made many improvements and related improvements, such as handling data consistency between different departments and associations. For the development of the rule analysis module, the development funds of higher education can be obtained in an economic form. Once the system is developed and implemented, it can improve the quality and efficiency of employment and assist in the information management of colleges and universities. Therefore, it is economically feasible to develop the management information system of the University of Mining and Technology in accordance with federal regulations.7.3.

"AbstractBackgroundNigeria's national health information system (HIS) data sources are grouped into institutional and population based data that traverse many government institutions. Communication and collaboration between these institutions are limited, fraught with fragmentation and challenges national HIS functionality.ObjectivesThe objective of this paper was to share insights from and the implications of a recent review of Nigeria's HIS policy in 2014 that resulted in its substantial revision. We also highlight some subsequent enactments.Review process and outcomesIn 2013, Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Health launched an inter-ministerial and multi-departmental review of the National Health Management Information System policy of 2006. The review was guided by World Health Organization's 'Framework and Standards for Country Health Information Systems'. The key finding was a lack of governance mechanisms in the execution of the policy, including an absent data management governance process. The review also found a multiplicity of duplicative, parallel reporting tools and platforms.ConclusionRecommendations for HIS Policy revisions were proposed to and implemented by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The revised HIS policy now provides for a strong framework for the leadership and governance of the HIS with early results.Key MessageThe new 2014 Nigerian Health Information System (HIS) policy explicitly emphasises data standards that will enable a systematic integration"
"now provides for a strong framework for the leadership and governance of the HIS with early results.Key MessageThe new 2014 Nigerian Health Information System (HIS) policy explicitly emphasises data standards that will enable a systematic integration and interoperability of sub-systems in an ICT driven environment.Governance structures for a national HIS architecture must incorporate institutions that contribute data to the system.Political will and funding are critical for the HIS to achieve its goals.BackgroundHealth Information Systems (HIS) constitute a crucial building block of any country health system. Underperforming HIS render national planning and other management decision-making functions in the health system inefficient, and increase missed opportunities in the use of available resources to save more lives (Boerma & Stansfield,2007; Makinde, Mami, Oweghoro, Oyediran, & Mullen,2016b). As one of the six building blocks of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Systems Strengthening framework, HIS, which form the basis for the production, analysis, dissemination and use of quality data, has in the last decade received renewed attention in several Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) (Hotchkiss, Diana, & Foreit,2012; World Health Organization,2007).Problem statement and objectiveNigeria's National Health Management Information System Policy (NHMIS) introduced in 2006 was increasingly being realised by national planners not to be producing improvements at a pace"
"World Health Organization,2007).Problem statement and objectiveNigeria's National Health Management Information System Policy (NHMIS) introduced in 2006 was increasingly being realised by national planners not to be producing improvements at a pace expected. The review was triggered by a realisation by leading health planners that the problems that the NHMIS was meant to address were not being achieved. For example, data availability and its use for decision making were poor. Also, adequate cross collaboration by various contributors to the national HIS was not taking place. Consequently, in 2013, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) instituted a review of the policy to better diagnose its shortcomings and in turn optimise for a more optimally functioning Health Information System. The objectives of this paper were to (i) share insights and experiences from a review of Nigeria's NHMIS Policy, (ii) describe the process and analytical framework used for the review of the policy, (iii) outline the content of the new HIS policy and the strategic plan developed alongside and (iv) highlight some subsequent milestones achieved.What is a health information system?HIS of a country is typically comprised of six components: HIS resources, indicators, data sources, data management, information products and information use (World Health Organization,2008).

"indicators, data sources, data management, information products and information use (World Health Organization,2008). HIS data are clustered into institutional and population based sources. The management and administration of these data sources are distributed across multiple government Ministries, Departments and Agencies with little or no direct interconnecting communication linkages (Abouzahr & Boerma,2005; Makinde, Olapeju, Ogbuoji, & Babalola,2016c; World Health Organization,2008). Statistical products from these institutions are often needed to make evidence based decisions (AbouZahr, Adjei, & Kanchanachitra,2007). The absence of appropriate coordination mechanisms is a predicament of several LMIC that necessarily require evidence to assure the efficient allocation of limited resources.Routine health information systems (RHIS) as a tool in LMIC settings with potential for health system performance measurement have been inadequately utilised in several LMIC settings, often traceable to poor planning and quality of the data (Aqil, Lippeveld, & Hozumi,2009; Lippeveld,2017; Wagenaar, Sherr, Fernandes, & Wagenaar,2016). RHIS are defined as 'systems that provide information at regular intervals of a year or less to meet predictable information needs. These include paper based or electronic health records and facility based and district-level management information systems' (Hotchkiss et al.,2012). Inadequate planning can fuel barriers towards an interconnected HIS in an"
"predictable information needs. These include paper based or electronic health records and facility based and district-level management information systems' (Hotchkiss et al.,2012). Inadequate planning can fuel barriers towards an interconnected HIS in an evolving environment that increasingly uses information and communications technology (ICT). Barriers to interconnection of the HIS also included lack of standards, inadequate political will, economic challenges, limited infrastructure and constrained human resource skills (Akhlaq, McKinstry, Muhammad, & Sheikh,2016; Kumar, Gotz, Nutley, & Smith,2017; Makinde et al.,2016b; van Panhuis et al.,2014). Abouzahr & Boerma argue that in many cases the expansion of national surveys in response to monitoring and evaluation for the Millennium Development Goals contributed to an adverse shift in focus away from the systematic institutional strengthening of routine country health information systems (Abouzahr & Boerma,2005). Several authors have called for caution in the development of new HIS to better meet the data needs to adequately monitor national progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by LMIC (Nabyonga-Orem,2017; Thomas, Silvestre, Salentine, Reynolds, & Smith,2016).

"This is because the proliferation of new health information systems will likely be vertical, require huge resources for their deployment and will further burden a system known to be weak and ineffective. However, some gains were made through the Health Data Collaborative partnership to strengthen countries' routine information systems (Lippeveld,2017; Thomas,2017). The Health Data Collaborative partnership is a multi-stakeholder effort made up of international agencies, governments, philanthropies, donors and academics, aimed at improving the availability, quality and use of data for local decision making, and tracking progress towards the SDGs. The partnership has supported the FMOH to conduct a situation analysis of its Monitoring and Evaluation system (Health Data Collaborative,2016).The Nigerian health information systemData for the Nigeria HIS reside across multiple institutions and systems highlighted in Table1. These institutions and their systems neither routinely communicate with one another nor share data (Asangansi,2012; Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria,2014). Previous studies had identified weak HIS leadership and governance, turf rivalries, unclear assignment of roles and responsibilities, lack of financial incentives and limited technical skills; the associated absence of interagency coordination and collaboration has been linked with silos and inefficiency in the HIS (Asangansi,2012; Makinde et al.,2016b).

"incentives and limited technical skills; the associated absence of interagency coordination and collaboration has been linked with silos and inefficiency in the HIS (Asangansi,2012; Makinde et al.,2016b). Furthermore, prior national policy guidance on HIS was narrowly focused on just the Ministry of Health without proper interconnection of related institutions. The increased availability and adoption of ICT to consolidate the management of these different data sources call for better collaboration and coordination. Limited availability of resources (financial and technical) across government departments also necessitates that resources be better leveraged and focused on areas and activities that yield the highest impact. Likewise, long overlooked, proper interconnection and joint planning between all institutions involved in health information management is likely to substantially minimise duplication and reduce wastage of resources (Makinde et al.,2018). In response to this shortfall and the desire for an improvement in the use of evidence for decision making, the government decided to review Nigeria's HIS. The review targeted the national HIS policy; it prioritised underlying limitations in the policy and explored ways for policy implementation to leverage growing trends in increased ICT penetration in Nigerian health systems.

This was followed up by the development of an electronic Health Facility Registry to actively manage the Master Facility List and in planning for a health information exchange to link all the health facility based data sources. The Master Facility List 'is a complete listing of health facilities in a country (both public and private) comprised of a set of identification items for each facility (signature domain) and basic information on the service capacity of each facility (service domain)' (World Health Organization,2012). The Master Facility List allocates unique identifiers to health facilities to advance the integration and interoperability of systems that contain information on different health facilities in the country (Makinde, Azeez, & Adebayo,2016a; USAID,2017).

"Azeez, & Adebayo,2016a; USAID,2017). Health facilities have a central role in the health system and successfully deploying a process to manage their registration and deregistration in an information system is important for determining the number of active health facilities at each point in time. This is necessary for the reliable calculation of routine health indicators that require the number of active health facilities as the denominator (e.g. report completeness rates).Actors in the Nigerian health information systemNigeria is a Federation of 36 semi-autonomous states and a Federal Capital Territory with an estimated population of over 180 million people and a Gross National Income per Capita of $2450 in 2016 (Federal Government of Nigeria,1999; The World Bank,2016). The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) develops health policies and laws which may be adopted for implementation by the states at their discretion as health is not on the exclusive list of issues adjudicated by the Federal Government (Onyemelukwe,2016). States also oversee Local Government Areas which are smaller administrative units within them. The Ministries, Departments and Agencies in Nigeria that have responsibility for the health system include the FMOH, Federal Ministry of Education, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning (formerly National Planning Commission), National Health Insurance Scheme, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, National Agency"
"Federal Ministry of Education, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning (formerly National Planning Commission), National Health Insurance Scheme, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, National Agency for the Control of AIDS, National Population Commission (NPC), Nigerian Institute for Medical Research, the National Bureau of Statistics and a few others. Each entity acts independently with different responsibilities that affect the national HIS.The FMOH oversees the NHMIS which administers routine health data collation and processing in the country. The mandate of the FMOH is 'Provision of quality stewardship and services for the health of all Nigerians', and its Vision is 'A World-Class Government Institution that ensures a healthy Nigeria' while its Mission is 'To develop and implement policies that strengthen the national health system for effective, efficient, accessible and affordable delivery of health services in partnership with other stakeholders'. The FMOH relies on the NHMIS to provide it with evidence for decision making. The NHMIS has evolved over several years since it was first established in the 1960s as a medical statistics system (Federal Ministry of Health,2007). After several iterations, the RHIS are now managed using the District Health Information System (DHIS) software designed by University of Oslo, Norway. Recent assessments of the NHMIS"
"1960s as a medical statistics system (Federal Ministry of Health,2007). After several iterations, the RHIS are now managed using the District Health Information System (DHIS) software designed by University of Oslo, Norway. Recent assessments of the NHMIS revealed significant shortcomings in the system (Asangansi,2012; Makinde et al.,2012a). During an assessment visit, several computers were found in their supply boxes untouched while computations were done by hand (Makinde et al.,2012b). Frontline health workers complained of parallel data collection tools across disease programmes which made completion difficult and time consuming (Bosch-Capblanch et al.,2017). Transmission of data from the Local Government to the State Ministry of Health was challenged because of poor access to internet services, resulting in data backlog and poor quality data (Asangansi,2012; Asangansi et al.,2013; Makinde et al.,2012a).Nigeria's large disease and disability burden is associated with a weak health system (National Population Commission, Federal Republic of Nigeria & ICF International, Maryland USA,2014). Governance of the health system in general has been a main problem, especially in a decentralised system as practiced in Nigeria (Eboreime et al.,2017; Uneke, Ezeoha, Ndukwe, Oyibo, & Onwe,2012; Uneke et al.,2015). The recent drive to ensure Universal Health Coverage needs to be backed by evidence to show areas of progress or gaps in order to redirect investments (Tilley-Gyado, Filani,"
"et al.,2017; Uneke, Ezeoha, Ndukwe, Oyibo, & Onwe,2012; Uneke et al.,2015). The recent drive to ensure Universal Health Coverage needs to be backed by evidence to show areas of progress or gaps in order to redirect investments (Tilley-Gyado, Filani, Morhason-Bello, & Adewole,2016). A viable RHIS should guide investments in the health system in a country. However, its underperformance can be catastrophic resulting in biased investments, planning and poor health outcomes. Studies have shown the RHIS in Nigeria to be inadequate to support mental health, maternal and child health, malaria, and disease surveillance decisions (Makinde,2016; Mokuolu et al.,2016; Nnebue, Onwasigwe, Ibeh, & Adogu,2013; Upadhaya et al.,2016; Wollum, Burstein, Fullman, Dwyer-Lindgren, & Gakidou,2015). Efforts aimed at addressing the RHIS are exploring the deployment of mobile enabled applications to improve the timeliness and completeness of reports (Asangansi & Braa,2010; Asangansi et al.,2013).Whereas the FMOH has the general oversight over the health system, the need to make meaning out of routine data requires population based statistics which is the responsibility of another government agency, the National Population Commission. Similarly, nutrition interventions which is a determinant of better health outcomes require a multi-sectoral approach across several in-country institutions including the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Budget and National Planning and the"
"interventions which is a determinant of better health outcomes require a multi-sectoral approach across several in-country institutions including the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Budget and National Planning and the Ministry of Finance. Annual national intercensal population estimates have not been routinely released over the years; consequently, fostering a plethora of conflicting estimates in use derived from the most recent census completed in 2006. Similarly, different study reports on disease burden funded by different donors show diverse sets of estimates (National Bureau of Statistics,2011; National Population Commission, Federal Republic of Nigeria, & ICF International, Maryland USA,2014). To begin to comprehensively address these issues, it became necessary to conceive strategies and tactics that will identify and eliminate the barriers to a successful HIS. For the HIS to fulfil its mandate, it is necessary for the different government agencies which generate health data to work collaboratively, for their systems to communicate and interoperate. This informed the need for a joint review of the HIS Policy and the development of a strategic plan to guide implementation. Following several stakeholder consultations, a new HIS policy and an accompanying 5-year strategic plan were developed in 2014.Review processThe 2014 Nigeria NHMIS policy review was led by the Department of Health Planning Research and Statistics of the FMOH.

"stakeholder consultations, a new HIS policy and an accompanying 5-year strategic plan were developed in 2014.Review processThe 2014 Nigeria NHMIS policy review was led by the Department of Health Planning Research and Statistics of the FMOH. Using a broad stakeholder base and shared vision approach as detailed in the 'Framework and Standards for Country Health Information Systems' of the WHO, several other stakeholders and partners were co-opted into the review process. The represented institutions at the review include different departments across the FMOH (Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Public Health, Family Health, Hospital Services, Food and Drug Services & Procurement), other federal agencies listed earlier and representatives of the state ministries of health. Others were donor agencies, development partners, bilateral and multilateral agencies including the WHO and UNFPA, MEASURE Evaluation (a project funded by the United States Agency for International Development) and PATHS2 (a project funded by the Department for International Development-funded).One of the initial issues the FMOH sought to redress was the realisation that an NHMIS policy was narrowly and exclusively focused on routine health data which was a subsystem of a health information system as defined by WHO.

"which was a subsystem of a health information system as defined by WHO. The narrowly focussed NHMIS policy was confined to health services data under the Ministry of Health and left out other agencies outside the Ministry of Health that oversaw or had substantial roles on other data components and data products in a complete HIS. Given that an HIS is an interconnected web of data sources which span multiple institutions, the proposal that the FMOH makes a policy pivot from a NHMIS policy to a National Health Information System policy was accepted. Consequently, the review included stakeholders and agencies that had responsibilities for a range of data sources in a more complete HIS - including censuses, surveys, civil registration & vital statistics and human resources.The review and consultative sessions spanned about 11 months, from April 2013 till February 2014, facilitated by one of the authors. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the previous policy was carried out by the stakeholders at the commencement of the first consultative session. Participants analysed previously completed RHIS assessments in small groups, and shortcomings were identified (Makinde et al.,2012a). Suggested interventions to strengthen the system were formulated. In addition, a rapid WHO Health Metrics Network (HMN) HIS Assessment was completed by stakeholders that provided useful evidence to drive the development of the new HIS policy revision and strategic plan"

The HIS Policy of 2014 has seven sections: the background, policy framework, data governance, data architecture, indicators and sources, data management, dissemination and use, data security and monitoring and evaluation. These sections were further elaborated in an accompanying 5-year strategic plan (2014-2018) that was prepared to guide the implementation of the policy.The vision of the policy is 'a Health Information System (HIS) that ensures evidence based decision making for improved health status of Nigerians' while the mission is 'to produce timely, reliable and accurate data that will inform policy making, evidence based decision and resource allocation for health care at the LGA, State and Federal Levels'.1Five objectives were developed to drive the implementation of the HIS.

"objectives were developed to drive the implementation of the HIS. These are as follows:To improve data governance.To improve data architecture, indicators and sources.To improve data management, dissemination and use.To improve data security.To monitor and evaluate health information system performance.Participants conceded that the narrowly focused and poorly implemented NHMIS policy left the health system without a guide, leading to 'blind' investments in the health system; it did not have requisite evidence on where the limited resources would have had the largest impact. The limited availability of reliable data to generate health statistics tended to increase reliance on the use of estimations that relied on assumptions with resultant associated errors and questionable reliability (Makinde & Oyediran,2015; Walker, Bryce & Black,2007). The proposed steps for achieving this new vision are described in the remaining part of this section.Improve data governanceA repurposed national HIS requires a broad stakeholder base that accepts that such a HIS straddles multiple government institutions. It also requires leadership with the political will and power to act in order for set goals to be achieved. The HIS governance section was ranked the lowest by stakeholders in the rapid HMN assessment exercise, indicating that the HIS governance domain was under-developed.

"was ranked the lowest by stakeholders in the rapid HMN assessment exercise, indicating that the HIS governance domain was under-developed. To address this, the new HIS policy proposed the establishment of a health data governance structure that will provide leadership, provide direction on investments in the HIS and promote the use of data produced through the HIS for decision making at the national and state levels. A National Health Data Governance Council (HDGC) to be chaired by the Minister of Health will oversee the administration of the National HIS while state level HDGCs chaired by Commissioners of Health will oversee the administration of the HIS at the state and provide advisory support to the national HDGC. The state HDGC will also design-in the interests of each state into the national HIS infrastructure. Poor governance of the HIS has been one of the blights of the health system (Uneke et al.,2013). The creation of the HDGC is set to tackle some of these problems by bringing together various stakeholders under the direction of the Minister of Health.Vertical programmes have in no small measure, contributed to the fragmentation of the HIS in LMIC (Kawonga, Blaauw, & Fonn,2012). A vertical programme is a component of the health system which '(i) has specific defined objectives usually quantitative and relating to a single condition or small group of conditions, (ii) objectives which focus on short or medium term and (iii) has centralised management and discrete"
"of the health system which '(i) has specific defined objectives usually quantitative and relating to a single condition or small group of conditions, (ii) objectives which focus on short or medium term and (iii) has centralised management and discrete means' (Cairncross, Periès, & Cutts,1997). The new governance structure is designed to make vertical programmes responsive towards health system strengthening rather than fuel its fragmentation. The HDGC will be supported by a Health Data Consultative Committee at both (national and state) levels of its creation. Members of the Health Data Consultative Committee will include technical specialists across various departments within the MOH, technical staff of other ministries involved in the HIS and development partners - multilateral and bilateral - involved in strengthening the HIS in the country. The Health Data Consultative Committee will do most of the groundwork and present to the HDGC for ratification intermittently. However, the Nigerian health system has not enjoyed the best of domestic funding over the years resulting in inadequate recruitment of skilled professionals into government institutions. The Abuja declaration by the Presidents of African countries in 2001 for the commitment of 15% of annual budget to improve the health sector remains unachieved by the country (World Health Organization,2011). In 2014, the country allocated only 6% of its budget to the health sector most of which was to recurrent expenditure"
"the commitment of 15% of annual budget to improve the health sector remains unachieved by the country (World Health Organization,2011). In 2014, the country allocated only 6% of its budget to the health sector most of which was to recurrent expenditure (Ihekweazu,2013). To address this shortfall in skilled hands, technical specialists from development partners in the Health Data Consultative Committee will help alleviate the inadequate technical skills in the Ministry of Health.Improve data architecture, indicators and data sourcesAs Nigeria continues to adopt and deploy various electronic applications for the management of its health and allied information, the need to adhere to standards is increasingly apparent. This will also be in line with the guidance of the WHO sixty-sixth assembly resolution. One of these standards that will need to be adhered to is the unique identification for health facilities across different information systems. A detailed description of this national standard has been put together (Makinde et al.,2014). Such standards will aid the integration and interoperability of the different components of the National HIS infrastructure and will pave the way for a health information exchange.The need to streamline the number of national indicators and imposing controls on their creation and modification was identified by stakeholders during the consultative workshops.

"streamline the number of national indicators and imposing controls on their creation and modification was identified by stakeholders during the consultative workshops. It was recommended that the powers on the final approval to add to, or remove from the national health indicators' list be held by the National HDGC which will sit twice every year. Furthermore, as part of strategies to address the collaboration between different departments, an important need for enhanced communication was identified. This objective will help to address communication gaps through the provision of a channel for communication between stakeholders. To avoid distrust in the HIS arising from lack of communication, it will be necessary to ensure that stakeholders are regularly updated. The strategy also highlighted the need to improve data stewardship across the different cadres of health workers and also the need to strengthen mechanisms to regularly carry out supportive supervision to improve data quality.Improve data management, dissemination and useTo enhance the culture of evidence based decision making, it was also recommended that plans for data use should always follow any drive for the collection of the data. The absence of data use initiatives has been responsible for the failure of many data collection efforts that generate more work for frontline health workers (Lippeveld,2017).

"has been responsible for the failure of many data collection efforts that generate more work for frontline health workers (Lippeveld,2017). The new policy drive proposes the placement of more information in the hands of decision makers through the Health Data Consultative Committee and HDGC.The policy also highlights the need for the design and development of processes and guidelines for increased interrelationships between the different government institutions that manage health related data. For instance, the need for formalised processes for the provision of population statistics to the FMOH, States and the LGA authorities by the National Population Commission will be instituted.Embedding decision support tools in HIS is one of the processes that have helped to improve evidence based decision making in other parts of the world (Bates et al.,2003). Some decision support tools have already been developed in the DHIS software used by Nigeria. More of such decision support tools will be encouraged to be embedded in the National HIS to respond to the computation of different indicators and to help improve the efficiency of detecting outbreaks through mining of routine health data.Improve data securityThe increasing adoption of ICT for the management of health data also necessitates improving vigilance on data security.

"ICT for the management of health data also necessitates improving vigilance on data security. This will help ensure none to minimal loss of data in case of a catastrophe or an unforeseenforce majeure. Processes proposed to mitigate such disasters include mirroring of servers at multiple sites, development of guidelines that will drive the administration of the server and the utilisation of up-to-date antivirus and antimalware software to regularly protect the national HIS server. Furthermore, the need to consider engaging an independent consulting firm to audit the administration of the HIS intermittently was proposed. Processes that will guide the request and release of data will also be developed and monitored.Monitor and evaluate health information system performanceThe development and rollout of a new HIS policy will be incomplete without guidelines on how the implementation of the policy will be monitored. The new HIS policy and its strategic plan identify the importance of measuring performance of its implementation. This will guide adjustments on activities that fall short of targets and to refocus efforts towards the achievement of the stated goals. A variety of techniques will be used to monitor the performance of the HIS. For example, the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework could be used to assess the RHIS while global or specific indicators will be adopted or developed for other areas.

"the HIS. For example, the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework could be used to assess the RHIS while global or specific indicators will be adopted or developed for other areas. The PRISM framework is an innovative method to design, assess and evaluate the performance of RHIS in LMIC (Aqil et al.,2009). It assesses the organisational, technical and behavioural aspects of the RHIS (Aqil et al.,2009). The Monitoring and Evaluation of the HIS Policy will also foster a continuous improvement strategy and documentation of lessons learned to be applied in the development of another strategic plan in the future.DiscussionA new HIS policy and an accompanying strategic plan have been produced to address the issues that have long plagued the HIS in Nigeria. The HDGC at the national level and at state level provides an opportunity for the leadership of the health system across the different institutions to meet intermittently and to jointly decide on strategies for action. The National HDGC was inaugurated in January 2017, and discussions have begun among the different high level stakeholders on how to achieve the purpose of the HIS (Makinde & Oyediran,2017). At the technical level, the Health Data Consultative Committee has been reconvened and deliberations have started in providing support towards various targets of the HIS strategy.As part of the effort to improve the national data architecture, indicators and data sources, several efforts have been"
"Committee has been reconvened and deliberations have started in providing support towards various targets of the HIS strategy.As part of the effort to improve the national data architecture, indicators and data sources, several efforts have been embarked upon. The national Health Facility Registry application to manage the Master Facility List and address shortcomings of previous effort has been developed. The Health Facility Registry will serve as the hub for linking several other health facility based information systems that are being designed in the country. The Health Facility Registry homepage provides summary statistics of the health facility distribution in the country to the general population while administrators can manage health facility records after authentication. In line with the provision of the HIS policy for the biennial review of the national indicator list, this process was commenced in 2016 and was recently completed. Since this is the first review of indicators taking place after the SDGs came into effect, all the new SDG health performance indicator domains that were not addressed in the national HIS have been given attention. The WHO 100 core indicators have been used to guide the review process and to identify national priority indicators. Efforts are also being made to develop processes for the removal of redundant indicators from the list.

"to identify national priority indicators. Efforts are also being made to develop processes for the removal of redundant indicators from the list. However, this faces an uphill task as programmes maintain the importance of all their indicators. Currently, the DHIS tracks about 1000 data elements but produces only 85 summary indicators. Many of these data elements are rarely analysed. They have largely been retained at this time as the trade-off between retaining the commitment of different programmes in maintaining a single system.The Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) System is an important component of the HIS and also important in the measurement of the impact of various interventions. The SDGs have focused more attention on the CRVS. Goal 16.9 of the SDGs strives to achieve legal identity for all including birth registration while several other targets also focus on the cause specific mortality rates which can only be tracked through death registration (United Nations,2015). Registration of these health related events is the responsibility of the National Population Commission though these events predominantly occur within health facilities (Maduekwe, Banjo, & Sangodapo,2017). Performance of birth and death registration completeness is abysmally low in some parts of the country (Makinde et al.,2016c; National Bureau of Statistics & UNICEF,2017; Williams,2014).

"registration completeness is abysmally low in some parts of the country (Makinde et al.,2016c; National Bureau of Statistics & UNICEF,2017; Williams,2014). Joint planning on how improvement of the CRVS will be achieved between the health sector and the National Population Commission to foster national development goals is a necessary step. Already, efforts to achieve this through political direction from the HDGC and revitalisation of the Community Health Management Information System (CHMIS) have commenced. Countries with complete CRVS have been shown to have better socio-economic indices than countries with poorer performing CRVS (Phillips et al.,2015). Ensuring that the CRVS and CHMIS are functional is a significant step in improving the socio-economic status of the country as well as improving the performance of the health system.ConclusionThe 2014 Nigeria HIS Policy and the accompanying strategic plan have ignited and set the pace for the improvement of the HIS in Nigeria. The process of policy review highlighted the need for strong governance arrangements to reduce fragmentation and increase the prospects of unlocking value in data for better health outcomes. The review also reinforced the need and importance for intersectoral collaboration as health is a multi-stakeholder issue.

"collaboration as health is a multi-stakeholder issue. Implementation must similarly follow continued engagement of stakeholders in order to ensure that progress is achieved. Whilst the policy provides an ambitious framework for achieving several HIS goals, this needs to be matched by the political will and funding in order for these targets to be met and sustained.AcknowledgementsWe thank all the contributors to the technical sessions that produced the health information system policy and the accompanying strategic plan.Conflict of interestNone.FundingThis publication was produced with the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the terms of MEASURE Evaluation cooperative agreement GHA-A-00-08-00003-00 and MEASURE Evaluation cooperative agreement AID-OAA-L-14-00004.

"AbstractWith the advent of the information age and the continuous updating of modern educational methods, the learning form of schools has developed into a diversified structure, and the status of network teaching in the modern educational mechanism has also been continuously improved, achieving irreplaceable results in modern teaching. The advantages of network teaching in its breadth and ubiquity have been recognized and now accepted by students. At present, most of the schools relax students' study areas and increase students' interest in self-directed learning. A good online teaching method is an educational method formed by comprehensive use of modern educational technology. To sum up, it is imperative to develop a system that is suitable for schools to manage many dance resource websites. The dance resource information management platform organically integrates related digital resources around a certain theme to form a resource combination covering text, pictures, audio, video, and other types of materials, specifically related to content associations and subject indexing. This dance digital resource information can be revealed from multiple dimensions through the information system. It is convenient for users to retrieve and browse various information. This method facilitates the interaction between teachers and students, thereby greatly improving the utilization rate of digital information resources. The three-dimensional teaching of dance classroom is realized."
"retrieve and browse various information. This method facilitates the interaction between teachers and students, thereby greatly improving the utilization rate of digital information resources. The three-dimensional teaching of dance classroom is realized. Through the platform, a wealth of characteristic dance resource information can be collected from all over the world. Through the system's reorganization of dance information, value-added services of characteristic dance resources are realized, making the dance material novel and professional. The system has strong operability and practicability to achieve the integration of teaching design and diversification of learning applications.1. IntroductionDance is an art of human movement. Dance shows the overall human form in time and space through regular and beautiful human movements, expressions, and combined images. Moreover, it is used as the main means of expression, focusing on the expression of language or other artistic means. This method is difficult to surface the deep spiritual world of people, including delicate emotions and deep thoughts.

"a distinctive character, thereby creating a vivid dance image that can be perceived by people [1-3]. It expresses the aesthetic emotion and aesthetic ideal of the dancer. In turn, it reflects the aesthetic attributes of life. In addition, due to the characteristics of the human body's movement and continuous flow and change, dance must exist in a certain space and time. In dance activities, there is usually a musical accompaniment. Generally, specific clothing is required. Some dances also hold various props. If you are performing onstage, lighting and sets are also indispensable. Therefore, dance can also said to be a spatial, temporal, and comprehensive dynamic modeling visual art. The information resources of dance are complex and diverse. The dance is expressed in the form of multimedia information. The forms of dance information resources include text information, audio information, video information, and other information storage methods [4-7].The dancing information management platform organically integrates related digital resources around a specific theme, using virtual dance classroom technology to enrich the current dancing teaching model. Through platform construction, characteristic dance resource information can be collected from various places.

"can be collected from various places. Video data is more and more widely used as multimedia information that contains more information content and is more intuitive. On the other hand, with the increasing popularity and continuous development of network technology, more and more video information appears on the network. The system reorganizes dance information to realize value-added services of characteristic dance resources. At present, multimedia technology is booming at an unprecedented speed. Multimedia plays an increasingly important role in people's daily life [8-11]. It is very different from the text data of the past. Therefore, many problems arise when introducing video data into traditional databases [12-15]. Then, the determination of the video retrieval unit and the extraction of retrieval features are realized, in addition to the final realization. Content-based retrieval is not considered by traditional database management systems. In addition, the establishment method of video index and the design of user interface are also very different from traditional database systems. It is necessary to manage the video data on these networks. These managements have become an important development direction in the field of multimedia information processing. Video data is rich in information and complex in structure.

These problems and the rapid development of the network lead us to study the video database management system.Through the research and analysis of the key technologies required by the system, we have verified the feasibility of each technology. We are able to carry out actual project development work. The research goal of the system is a dancing information management platform built with network technology, computer technology, and modern information management technology. The main content of the project research needs to develop a dancing information management system suitable for dance majors. By implementing this system, dance schools can collect, analyze, and organize dance information resources. Then, the functions of resource rating and other functions are coordinated and integrated. The specific research contents are as follows: the front-end user platform of the dancing information management system and, according to the standardization of dance information resources, unified collection and processing organization, through systematic retrieval and establishment of a resource level rating mechanism.

"of demand analysis, system design, and system research and development, a retrieval platform with dance information resources is developed. A user platform is built for teaching resource rating functions. The dancing information management system can be effectively maintained, through various methods such as requirements analysis, system design, system development, and testing. On this basis, the dance information resources are collected, analyzed, and organized [16-19].Dance is associated with multimedia data, and multimedia resources are associated according to system requirements. On this basis, the system is modeled and associated with entity classes. The design of multimedia database needs to consider user needs. User design needs to focus on entity classes and association classes. The design of the database needs to learn from a lot of existing work, as to complete the application of object-oriented programming language. We believe that efficient mapping between relational databases is very important [3,10,20-22]. The system has a large amount of stored information and a high concurrent access rate. Database design becomes the key of dancing information management system. The system architecture software is a key point in the entire software development process.

"in the entire software development process. Different types of systems require different architectures. In addition, these initiatives also save on research and development costs. This is also a brand-new software system, which realizes these functions through the continuous deepening of construction technology [23-26]. For the two architectures, it is also the design focus of the dancing information management system. Dynamic websites are designed, and information systems are implemented. The system utilizes the current popular architectural techniques. The content and system functions of the requirements analysis phase are written and debugged. Through the test work, the separation of the presentation layer and the logic layer of the dynamic website is realized. This improves the maintainability of the code. In terms of system functionality, management information systems are a mixture of organizational theory, accounting, statistics, mathematical models, and economics [27,28]. The system adopts computer technology, network communication technology, data fragmentation technology, and other methods. It is a typical multidisciplinary cross-edge technology.

The system can effectively promote the overall improvement of students' abilities. From the point of view of sociotechnical systems, organizational structures interact with each other. There are many different scenarios for the creation of these new organizational structures. The latest design methods can be adopted through system analysis and design. The specific influencing factors include organizational environment, organizational strategy, and organizational goals. Therefore, the management information system is not only a technical system but also a social system. The research framework of this paper is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.

The introduction of the system will lead to the creation of new organizational structures. However, the analysis, design, and introduction of existing organizational structures also play an important role. This method mainly affects the organizational environment, organizational strategy, and organizational structure of the system.2.1. The Main Structure of the Management SystemC/S system architecture is a client and server architecture with many existing applications. It is software system architecture. Through it, the advantages of the hardware environment at both ends can be fully utilized, and the tasks can be reasonably allocated to both ends of the service, thus reducing the communication overhead of the system. At present, most software systems are two-tier structures in the form of CS. Because the current software application system is developing towards distributed application, different applications can process the same business. Different modules share logical components in application. Therefore, both internal and external users can access various versions of the application system.

"A new application system can be extended through the logic in the existing application system. This is the development direction of the current application system. The traditional architecture mainly adopts the open mode. It is only the openness of the system development level. In a specific application, both ends of the service also require specific software to support because of the failure to provide the open environment that users really expect. The software of the architecture needs to develop different software versions for different operating systems. The replacement of products is very fast. The current iterative model has been difficult to adapt to the simultaneous use of hundreds of computer users. In addition, this mode is expensive and inefficient. The model research framework is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointB/S architecture is browser and server architecture. The characteristic of this architecture is that the computers accessing the server generally do not need fixed programs and networks, as long as the server can be accessed by using a browser. The design of the system needs to pay attention to the choice of the architecture. The client-server architecture is a well-known software system architecture, including browser structure and server structure. With the rise of technology, structural changes or improved structures require more attention. The client needs to send service instructions to the server through the client. The specific"
"architecture, including browser structure and server structure. With the rise of technology, structural changes or improved structures require more attention. The client needs to send service instructions to the server through the client. The specific software operates on the server. Then, the result of the operation is sent to the client. Through this mode, the effect of the server's execution operation is maximized. However, in the present, with the continuous development of the computer field, there are many programs whose layout is not on the server. Software development starts to take place independently of the server. The way operations are performed is also iterative. This also requires technical administrators to continuously optimize the code of the program. B/S architecture is characterized by its strong user sharing. This makes the maintenance of the server easier and saves many human resources. However, this technical means requires the server to be highly efficient. This method has high requirements on the hardware of the server. This technology has dominated the computer development field for a long time due to its unique breadth and flexibility. For example, our daily use of mailbox website access is achieved in this way.2.2.

"in this way.2.2. Overview of Modeling Language UMLUnified Modeling Language (UML) is a language for visual modeling of software-intensive systems. UML describes and visualizes the products of object-oriented development systems. The language became a standard language for documentation. The Unified Modeling Language is a nonproprietary third-generation modeling and specification language. The user interface is implemented entirely through the browser. Part of the transaction logic is implemented in the front end. The main transaction logic is implemented on the server side. The structure utilizes the ever-mature and popular browser technology to realize the powerful functions expressed by complex special-purpose software. UML is used during the research and development phase. It is mainly used to illustrate, visualize, and build system frameworks. We need to develop intensive software systems through object-oriented methods. UML presents a set of best engineering practices. These best practices are very effective in modeling large-scale, complex systems. Especially in the field of software, architecture has been proven effective. UML can run through every stage of the software development cycle. In addition, the system architecture was adopted by OMG and became an industry standard. UML is most suitable for data modeling, business modeling, and object modeling. As a modeling language, UML enables developers to focus on building models and structures of products. The language"
"was adopted by OMG and became an industry standard. UML is most suitable for data modeling, business modeling, and object modeling. As a modeling language, UML enables developers to focus on building models and structures of products. The language is not implemented using programming languages and algorithms. After the model is established, it can be converted into the specified programming language code by UML tools. The definition of UML consists of two parts: UML semantics and notation. UML semantic description is based on UML's precise meta model definition. This method provides a powerful extension mechanism. In the process of semantic definition, the hierarchical model structure is adopted. Specifically, it includes a one-dimensional model, a two-dimensional model, a multidimensional model, and a user object. UML notation represents the graphical notation and textual representation of UML semantics. This method is a modeling tool to investigate and analyze the software system from different aspects. UML can be classified into two categories: static modeling mechanism and dynamic modeling mechanism. The specific definition includes the following types of pattern analysis diagrams.2.3.

"AnalysisDance is a visual art that combines time and space. Therefore, the multimedia technology of dance can make everyone understand the knowledge of dance more intuitively. The multimedia information of dance includes video, audio, text, and other contents. We need to effectively classify and manage these resources and enable students and teachers to have good interactive learning. At the same time, it can also allow many dance lovers to get in touch with better dance teaching and training. In dance resource management, resources can be divided into two categories: one is divided according to the type of dance; the other is divided according to the level of dance. Student users can learn according to their own requirements. The main influencing factors of sports performance and training process are shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3. Design of Dance Management Information SystemThis chapter analyzes the system requirements around the architecture-based dance management information system, using object-oriented analysis and design methods, as well as the Visual Unified Modeling Language for analysis. Modeling tools are used to model the logistics management information system. Then the function of the system is analyzed.

This method gives full play to the characteristics and advantages of the object-oriented analysis method and lays a solid foundation for the subsequent system design.3.1. System Design Principles and System Common Frame DesignDevelop a personal study plan. In addition, you can also ask relevant questions and wait for the teacher to reply. Individual student users can also upload their own contact videos. Wait for the teacher's correction. Group student users can also upload their own programming. Students can also upload outstanding dance works. Thus, a resource collection covering various types of materials such as text, pictures, audio, and video is formed. The content of this collection is relevant, and the subject index is relatively complete. The information of these dance digital resources is revealed from multiple dimensions. Students can learn from each other's work and offer others to observe. With the advent of the information age, the form of learning in schools has developed into a diversified improvement.

Network teaching has been accepted by current students because of its extensive and universal advantages. Currently, most schools relax their students' areas of study and increase students' interest in independent learning. A good online teaching method greatly facilitates students' learning style, thereby saving a lot of workers, material resources, and other resources. The substantive meaning of network teaching is to use the network as the basic condition for teaching and to carry out learning exchanges between teachers and students through the network.The transformation formula of fixed indicators is as follows:(1)Interval transformation formula is as follows:(2)Through the following announcementP(Xc,Yc,Zc) in space connected to the cameraOandOPthe focal point of the image plane, the projection positionp(x,y).

"it is difficult for teachers to achieve one-on-one learning exchanges. Therefore, it is particularly important to carry out teaching work through the Internet. The system can facilitate users to retrieve and browse various information, thereby greatly improving the utilization rate of digital information resources. A good online teaching method is not just simple courseware; it is more than just providing a video file to watch. It is a multi-integrated teaching method formed by synthesizing and benefiting modern teaching technology. However, the most critical content of online courses is that teachers provide students to learn. It is available through the course's instructional website. However, the collection of many websites is bound to bring a sense of complexity and disorder to students. To sum up, this paper develops a system suitable for schools, which can be applied to comprehensive management of many dance resources. The construction of the website system is imperative. Model analysis results are shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAt present, the demand for independent learning of students is increasing. Teachers' online teaching resources should be adequately guaranteed accordingly. Teachers can build a website of course resources through the Internet, and there can be courseware for students to learn and video files to watch on the website.

"a website of course resources through the Internet, and there can be courseware for students to learn and video files to watch on the website. Teachers can also guide students' learning on the Internet and provide good guidance for students' learning through messages or online communication. A lot of time is also saved for students and teachers.Extra relative risk (ER) is used to reflect the effect of environmental factors on sports health risks. The ER value is based on the relationship coefficient in the regression modelβ. The calculation formula is(5)(6)(7)The constraint conditions are equations (3)-(5):(8)The final informationis expressed as the value that can be obtained,Ct, from the output information of the joint forgetting gate:(9)The calculation method is(10)Therefore, this also provides a direction for the application of network resources in the modern education system. The network is a new thing, and many fields have not yet formed a fixed model. Therefore, this requires teachers to continuously improve the application technology of network teaching. On the one hand, we constantly innovate the learning mode of online courses. In addition, each branch module is connected in series through the teaching network, to attract students' attention, so that students can take the initiative to learn. This enables students to actively communicate with teachers. Model analysis results are shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe concept of dance resource management"
"students' attention, so that students can take the initiative to learn. This enables students to actively communicate with teachers. Model analysis results are shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe concept of dance resource management information system is very rich. The system is not only a management system for developing dance resources. Due to the inseparability of information between teachers and students, in this way, the teacher-side management information module must be developed, as well as the student management module, the teacher-student online communication module, and so forth. The dance management system should summarize and classify the dance resources of the whole school. This makes it easier for students to search for resources online. Based on the demand analysis of dance competition system, four kinds of participants of the system can be identified. They are contestants, judges, test administrators, and system administrators. At the same time, students can also learn systematically according to the teacher's existing lesson plan. It makes the system really play a role as a bridge connecting teachers and students in learning and communication. At the same time, it also facilitates the school's management of dance resources and teacher and student information. It greatly played the role of the network in the teaching and management of colleges and universities and then made the management of modern education more convenient and reasonable."
"management of dance resources and teacher and student information. It greatly played the role of the network in the teaching and management of colleges and universities and then made the management of modern education more convenient and reasonable. Based on the above analysis of system functional requirements, the participants in the system can be divided into the main roles of the system. Examples of these roles are system administrator roles and user roles. Then, the functional requirements of the system are reconfigured. We need to further rationally plan each module in the system. The following will focus on the detailed analysis of the functional requirements from each role of the system. Model analysis results are shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.2. The Realization Process of Dance Resource Management Information SystemThe design of the information system is based on the actual needs and according to the following principles: Specifically, the principle of functional integrity is included. More and more enterprises are developing in the direction of intensification and scale. In the outline design of the system, it is necessary to map the requirements into the software structure according to certain steps.

"steps. According to the demand analysis of the logistics management information system, the system can be designed in detail. The whole system can be designed as several modules or subsystems. Each subsystem has relatively independent and interrelated functional modules. Different entity function modules in the subsystem support corresponding functions and services. I first break down the entire system in detail, providing support permissions for specific content. Teachers to upload resources use the teacher management subsystem. The student management subsystem is used to complete resource learning and uploading. Then, the modules are subdivided further, adding details. For example, system management includes department information management, role management, and user information management. However, information operation management is divided into two parts: adding and modifying. Model analysis results are shown in Figure7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe system has advantages in terms of infrastructure and technical approach. The system can tightly integrate different levels of information flow. System solutions follow the principle of modularity. The system can be configured on demand, keeping the architecture flexible.

"flexible. The system is easy to install, and each basic module and business module can run in any combination and then comprehensively meet the current and future personalized needs. The object-oriented method is adopted to realize the function of data encapsulation. The principles of sustainable development are as follows: The functions involved in different participants are not exactly the same. In the dance competition system, the contestant user can perform the following operations. First, check the information on the site and modify your personal information and password. The system should have good continuity and smooth expansion. Carry out long-term macro planning before system construction. This paper needs to further adapt to the new needs of market development. The system needs to cultivate its own compatibility to cope with complex business requirements. The system needs to provide an interactive system with friendly interface, simple operation, and smooth process. This system can improve the efficiency of managers. The data entry interface is designed to make the user's job as easy as possible. This reduces the error rate of input. To this end, the design should consider reducing the user's memory burden as much as possible and increase automatic data entry to make the interface predictable and consistent and prevent user input from errors.

"much as possible and increase automatic data entry to make the interface predictable and consistent and prevent user input from errors. As for being standard and open, all programs and interfaces have a unified standard, so that the system has excellent portability. The open interface enables easy application expansion and portability. For focusing on safety and efficiency, it has high network security and operational efficiency and can guarantee providing high-quality service and fast response speed. The system of stability and security adopts a multilevel protection system. There are three levels: network level, database level, and application level. On the premise of ensuring the reliability and stability of the system, it is necessary to further improve the performance. Using multithreading, data connection pool and load balancing technology can achieve good parallel performance. In this way, the real-time interaction capability of multiple users and large data volume is guaranteed. Model analysis results are shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem outline design is an important link between requirements analysis and detailed design stages. The task of this phase is to translate requirements into system functionality. Moreover, these system functions are organized in some way to form a system framework.

"Moreover, these system functions are organized in some way to form a system framework. A top-down, systematic approach is needed in the overall outline design of the system. View information about other people's work. View judge information. Check out the game mode. See how matches scored. Check out the game flow. In the dance competition information system, the judges can carry out various targeted operations. The system requirements are gradually disassembled. Moreover, map it to the specific function module of the system. Modularization refers to the process of gradually dismantling from top to bottom when solving a complex problem. Each module completes a specific function, and all modules are organized in a certain way. In this way, a complete system framework is constructed to complete the functions required by the entire system. Dividing the system into multiple modules is to reduce the complexity of the software system and improve readability and maintainability. However, the division of modules cannot be arbitrary, and its independence should be maintained as much as possible. Therefore, each module only completes the independent subfunction required by the system. Moreover, the connection with other modules is minimal and the interface is relatively simple. Try to achieve high cohesion and low coupling to improve the independence of modules. Lay the foundation for designing high-quality software structures.

Technical Overview of Management System ImplementationThe whole dance management system includes several major modules, namely, system management, teacher function management, and student function management. System management needs to manage the user rights, teaching resources, and communication forums of the entire system, including the daily maintenance of the system. Teacher function management mainly manages the resources uploaded by teachers. In turn, resources can be arranged to form a teaching plan. At the same time, the system manages the student interactive communication section. Student function management is mainly for students to classify and manage the resources they view. Moreover, you can ask questions about a resource in the interactive communication section. Model analysis results are shown in Figure10.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOn this basis, the system needs to strengthen the effectiveness of dance teaching.

"interactive activities between teachers and students across the boundaries of colleges and universities through online classrooms. It makes up for the shortcomings of traditional dance teaching mode. It breaks the neglect of paper teaching materials for the cultivation of students' ability, so as to realize the three-dimensional teaching of dance courses. Through modern network technology, accept remote information, transmission technology, multimedia production, and development of electronic teaching materials, so that the dance material is novel and professional and has strong operability and practicability. Thus, the system can achieve the integration of teaching design and diversification of learning applications. At present, most of the schools relax students' study areas and a good online teaching method can greatly facilitate students' interest in learning. At the same time, it also saves many human and material resources. The essence of network teaching is to provide the basic conditions for network teaching.

On the one hand, it is convenient for users to retrieve and browse various information, thereby greatly improving the utilization rate of digital information resources. In this way, the practical experience of using the virtual dance classroom teaching method is realized. Through the platform, a wealth of characteristic dance resource information has been collected from all over the world. Then the reorganization of the dance information is carried out. The value-added of characteristic dance resources is realized.4. Conclusion4.1. Management System Testing and Application VerificationPeople's requirements for designing products themselves are gradually increasing. It is not just about the actual cost of the product or the system itself. At the same time, people pay more attention to the actual output and benefit of the product itself. Therefore, the value of a design does not depend on the complexity of a system's implementation. Instead, more attention is paid to whether the product can solve the problem in the actual application process and provide greater convenience to the existing efficient management. Therefore, the analysis and design of dance management"
"implementation. Instead, more attention is paid to whether the product can solve the problem in the actual application process and provide greater convenience to the existing efficient management. Therefore, the analysis and design of dance management system. Analysis needs to be from three aspects: social feasibility, economic feasibility, and technical feasibility.4.2. The System Performance and Stress Testing(1) Social Feasibility. The development of the Internet is not just about changing our way of life. At the same time, it also has a huge impact on our daily behavior and thinking patterns. With the development of society, the scale of dance competitions has gradually expanded. However, the management requirements of competition entries and processes are also increasing. The traditional manual management method is no longer suitable for its development, including viewing the information on the site, modifying personal information and passwords, and viewing the information of the players' works. This paper has the primary task of analyzing the requirements of dance competition system and identifying participants and giving further introduction to the personal information management module. After users log in to the system, they can view personal information in user management. Therefore, through the application of information technology, great convenience can be brought to the information management of dance competitions, so as to help and improve the management"

Therefore, through the application of information technology, great convenience can be brought to the information management of dance competitions, so as to help and improve the management efficiency of dance competitions. Furthermore, many labor costs are saved. Relieve the burden and pressure on the competition management staff. It can be seen that the whole system has good social feasibility and application value.(2) Economic Feasibility. The establishment of the system is through direct investment in the construction of the bank. Therefore, the economic viability of the entire system itself must be considered. Moreover, the actual construction cost. Include the expected economic benefits. Judging from the actual application results at home and abroad. After logging in, modify and save the password.. Player users can view works in the entries management module. Judge users can view and rate works in this module. Exam administrators can view and manage work information in this module. This includes adding works, editing works, and deleting works. The analysis and design of dance management system can simplify the repetitive work in competition management on the one hand. Labor cost is saved by computer operation. It makes the process of dance competition management more standardized.

Putting the system into use makes the management of dance competitions scientific and efficient. Therefore, the system construction is economically feasible.(3) Technical Feasibility. In the realization process of dance management system, realization is through technology, frame technology, and database mode. Since these framework applications are all open-source frameworks, it is more convenient to learn and solve errors. Moreover, there are many existing plug-ins available, which are more convenient for program development and application. Therefore, it is feasible to realize the development and design of the dance management system technically.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the General Project of Teacher Education Curriculum Reform Research in Henan Province in 2021 (no. 2021-JSJYYB-050).Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Camacho M.
