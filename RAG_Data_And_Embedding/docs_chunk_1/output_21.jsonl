"is filled in during the visual inspection by the staff.Our research proposes a manipulation of linguistic subjective judgments expressed by the inspection staff on the degradation of a structure using fuzzy logic. The goal is to assess the current safety level of the inspected construction.The operator gives a linguistic judgment for each type of degradationEij. Thus, we have the crisp set of linguistic judgments:Gijk(small (S), medium (M), and large (L)), between which the inspector chooses the most suitable to represent the level of degradation, which is a subjective choice.With each linguistic judgmentGijkthe weightWijklthat it has on the current safety level using a crisp set of linguistic judgments is associated:Wijkl(very small (VS), small (S), slightly small (SLS), medium (M), slightly large (SLL), large (L), and very large (VL)). The weight is defined following the considerations of the expert staff.For each structural elementEi, the weightWEijklmthat the element has within the structure is given by the skilled staff, using a set of crisp linguistic judgments:WEijklm(small (S), medium (M), and large (L)).The linguistic variables represent our quality input (Figure1).With each linguistic variable we associate a membership functionμ(x) whose domainXis [0,1].

This interval will be discretized in order to obtain the vectors representative of the individual fuzzy functions, to which the fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification procedures will be applied.For both the judgmentsGijkand the weightsWijkl, the triangular membership functions shown in Figures7and8were chosen.

"from −1 to +0.25, the origin is coincident with safety exponentndefuzzificated. This discretization proved to be fine enough for the authors' method. Using smaller intervals did not improve results. After several attempts of optimization, it was found that the choice is strictly related to the type of application. It was decided to use the triangular asymmetrical membership functions shown in Figure10in which the value of the maximum membership function small corresponds to the average value of the safety exponentndefuzzificated.7. Application of the Proposed MethodThe proposed method was applied to the generic hyperstatic structure shown in Figure3, subject to forms of degradation of the type ULS, giving to the structural elements the weight that they have inside the building in question. It is important to stress that this weight is defined by experts before the inspection takes place. Based on the above considerations, the weight large was assigned to the pillars that constitute the ground floor, medium to those constituting the first floor, and finally small to the beams (Figure3).It is assumed that the structure in question is in an advanced state of degradation and that the Evaluation Card is the one shown in Table10for the beams and in Table11for the columns.Table  10.Degradation assessment card beams.Structural elementEiType of degradationEijLinguistic judgementGijkSafety goalWijklSafety exponentnBeamShear stressSmallMedium5.12MediumLarge3.88LargeVery"

An example is shown where an exponent safetynis obtained equal to 5.12 using the proposed procedure. This value is obtained by giving the judgment small to the event of degradation. The weight of such a safety issue is medium.The procedures suggested in the literature are two. The first, based on fuzzy sets theory [8-10], follows the approach suggested by Blockley [6,7] using the intersection operator, merge and fuzzy relations. The second procedure, recommended by Tee et al. [32], is based on the algebra of fuzzy numbers [8-10] with the use of the weighted average.

"is based on the algebra of fuzzy numbers [8-10] with the use of the weighted average. In this study we followed and extended the first procedure in accordance with Acito [21].The intersection operator initially combines the single judgmentGijkwith the weightWijklthat it has on structural safety expressed vectorially in the following form:(6)Given two fuzzy sets, for example,Gijk= small andWijkl= medium, the intersection between small and medium is defined as the fuzzy setD=S∩Mhaving the characteristic function shown in Figure11:(7)Figure 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe intersection of two fuzzy setsGijk= small andWijkl= medium; graphic of the characteristic function intersection.The fuzzy functions are represented by vectors 1 ×Nf, and a discretization was chosen such thatNf= 41. Therefore, the result of the procedure of intersection is a vector 1 × 41.The combined effect of the judgment and the weight relative to each degradation was calculated (6), in order to evaluate whether the security level of an a priori assumption for the building visually inspected was altered. The security level is expressed by the initial value of the safety exponentn. Following the regulations [22,23], it can be seen thatnhas values ranging from 1 to 7, according to the limit state.In the proposed method the variation range of the exponent is assumed to be the domain of the security level.

"ranging from 1 to 7, according to the limit state.In the proposed method the variation range of the exponent is assumed to be the domain of the security level. Since the safety measurement is positive ifn≥ 4, the value 7 represents the optimum value.It is assumed a priori that the hypothesis of the structure under examination is designed and constructed in conformity with the regulations.In this case we assume the structure, in presence of the loads required by regulations, to be in a safe condition. Therefore, if we refer to the value of the safety measure usually denoted byPf= 10−n[21] we can assume an a priori value of the exponentnequal to 7.We need then to establish a fuzzy relation between the judgment of a single type of deterioration and the evaluation of the safety exponent, by adopting a fuzzy composition according to(8)We know the value of the fuzzy relationR(G∩W) given by (6), while in order to derive the fuzzy relationR(W×N) we need to use the inference procedure based on logical operations. We thus have the following rules of inference [8-10,21]:IfWijklis very smallthenPfis very small andnis very large.IfWijklis smallthenPfis small andnis large.IfWijklis slightly smallthenPfis slightly small andnis slightly large.IfWijklis mediumthenPfis medium andnis medium.IfWijklis slightly largethenPfis slightly large andnis slightly small.IfWijklis largethenPfis large andnis small.IfWijklis very largethenPfis very large andnis very small.With each linguistic variable used"

The fuzzy functions corresponding to the safety exponentnare represented by vectors 1 ×Ne. For the safety exponentNewe discretize the domain [2,7] of the fuzzy function usingNe= 21 points and therefore 20 intervals of width equal to 0.05, thus obtaining a vector of dimensions 21 × 1. In Table8we showed the values fora,b, andcfor the chosenNemembership functions.Figure 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe membership functions of safety exponent:Ne(very small (VSS), small (SS), slightly small (SLSS), medium (MS), slightly large (SLLS), large (LS), and very large (VLS)).N= (very small (VSS), small (SS), slightly small (SLSS), medium (MS), slightly large (SLLS), large (LS), and very large (VLS)).The fuzzy relationR(W×N) can be written as specified in (9).A fuzzy relation is a fuzzy set defined on multiple domains (multidimensional fuzzy set).

It is necessary to get the value of the exponent of securitynas a real number to be able then to compare it with the value of the same a priori assumption depending on the state reference limit (1).In the literature [21] defuzzification is obtained by extracting the minimum value of the exponentnwhich corresponds to the maximum membership. In this case, however, the results are not satisfactory because the defuzzified value does not vary in accordance with lexical judgement and weight variations. In the specific literature concerning fuzzy logic [4,6-11] this value can be obtained in various ways as the method of the center of the area and the method of the average of the maximum. In this particular case, it was considered convenient to takenas the average value between the maximum value and the minimum value among those with maximum membership.Giving the valuesGijk= small andWijkl= medium we obtainn= 5.12, with a maximum value of 6.25 and a minimum value of 4.00. It will be shown that the weight of the structural elementWEijklmcan change this value that so far was affected only by the weight of the event of degradationWijkl.

The membership functionsμ(x), associated with each linguistic variable small, medium, and large of the weightWEijklm, have a domain membership ofXthat is between 0 and 1. We decided to use membership functions of triangular asymmetrical shape shown in Figure10in which the value corresponding to the maximum membership function small corresponds to the average value of thendefuzzified safety exponent. As can be seen from Figure10the midpoint of the safety factornis equal to 5.12, associated with the judgment of gravityG= small and weightW= medium, which corresponds to the maximum value of the membership function small of the weightWEassociated with each structural element.The value of the defuzzified exponent obtained from the final fuzzification procedure of Cartesian product (N×WE) is defuzzified by choosing the average of the values ofnwith maximum membership.

However, both the weights medium and large modify the value of the exponent, decreasing its value within the range defined by the experts. Giving medium weight a final value of the safety factor equal to 4.69 was obtained (Figure17), while giving weight large an even smaller value, that is, 4.5, was obtained (Figure18).Figure 16Open in figure viewerPowerPointSafety exponent achieved by givingGijk="

"of a structural project was decided upon for which we have more causes of failure.A chain mechanism is assumed, in series, in which the probability of failure of each event of degradation is identified with the probability of failure of a single link in the chain, and the probability of failure of the entire chain, in the hypothesis of independence of the results of each loop, takes the expression [12-15,21,33,34](13)wheremis the number of degradation types. From this the value of the combined safety exponentnis obtained.8. Analysis of ResultsIn Figure3, where each structural element is associated with a safety factor, it can be seen that although the same linguistic judgment of gravity has deliberately been given to the degradation expressions associated with the columns corresponding to different floors, the different weight given (large to the lower floor columns and medium to the upper floor columns) affected the final safety factor. The results obtained for the row of pilasters 1010-2010-3010, for the row of pilasters 1020-2020-3020, for the row of pilasters 1030-2030-3030, and finally for the beams, with associated weight small, are shown (Figure3).The choice of the weights was made using the following criteria: firstly the weight of columns of the ground floor is greater than the weight of the other elements of the structure and secondly a greater weight to the columns in respect to the beams is assigned and, within this differentiation, it is necessary to give"
"firstly the weight of columns of the ground floor is greater than the weight of the other elements of the structure and secondly a greater weight to the columns in respect to the beams is assigned and, within this differentiation, it is necessary to give greater weight to events related to shear degradation rather than to those related to bending.8.1. Case 1: 1010-2010-3010 Row of PilastersFor the lower column E1010-2010to both manifestations of degradation the linguistic subjective judgment medium was assigned obtaining, respectively,n= 3.88 andn= 4.5 (the values are different because the weight that each manifestation of degradation has on safety is different, in particular large and medium, resp.).The same linguistic judgment was given to the higher columns E2010-3010 and accordingly the same resultsn= 3.88 andn= 4.5 were obtained (Table12).The difference lies in the fact that the weight associated with the element E1010-2010is large, while the weight associated with the element E2010-3010is medium. These weights change, according to the fuzzy logic method, the value of the safety exponent associated with each manifestation of degradation, resulting for the structural element E1010-2010in weighed safety factors, respectively, equal to 3.25 and 3.88 (Table12), while for the element E2010-3010we obtain, respectively, a weighted safety factor equal to 3.44 and 4.13 (Table12).It is clear then that both the weight large and the weight medium reduce the safety factornresulting"
"equal to 3.25 and 3.88 (Table12), while for the element E2010-3010we obtain, respectively, a weighted safety factor equal to 3.44 and 4.13 (Table12).It is clear then that both the weight large and the weight medium reduce the safety factornresulting in a different safety factor that depends on the weight that the structural element has within the hyperstatic structure. It is important to underline that the unweighted safety factorn= 3.88 associated with the expression of deterioration under consideration (reinforcement corrosion) is close to the safety range limit equal to 4 and it is furthermore reduced to the value of 3.25 for the structural element E1010-2010and to the value of 3.44 for E2010-3010. Hence the different weight values further reduce the safety coefficientn, in the interest of safety. In the same way the unweighted safety coefficientn= 4.5 associated with the other expression of degradation (detachment of the concrete cover) is reduced to the value 3.88 for the structural element E1010-2010, while for the element E2010-3010it is reduced to the value 4.13. The safety condition is no longer satisfied whenn< 4.The fuzzy procedure that relates the safety factor to the weight that the structural element has within the structure further reduces the coefficient within a range determined a priori by experts. In fact, attributing the weight large to both manifestations of degradation safety requirements are no longer satisfied in both cases, while attributing the"
"the structure further reduces the coefficient within a range determined a priori by experts. In fact, attributing the weight large to both manifestations of degradation safety requirements are no longer satisfied in both cases, while attributing the weight medium safety condition is verified only in the case of the manifestation of degradation spalling.8.2. Case 2: 1020-2020-3020 Row of PilastersIn the case under study, to the elements E1020-2020and E2020-2030and for both degradation events the linguistic judgment small was assigned, obtaining, respectively,n= 5.12 andn= 5.62 (Table12) (different values of the safety coefficients are expected because the weight that each event has on the degradation of safety is different, medium and slightly small, resp.).The weightWEassociated with the element E1020-2020is large, while the weight associated with E2020-3020is medium. The result is that the structural element E1020-2020has weighed safety factors equal to 4.50 and 4.94, respectively (Table12), while the corresponding values for the element E2020-3020are 4.69 and 5.06 (Table12).Also in this case both the weights large and medium reduce the safety coefficientnobtaining different safety coefficients which depend on the weight that the structural element has in the hyperstatic structure. It should be noted that although the coefficientnis reduced, it is still in a condition of safety because, for both elements, the final result is greater than the safety limit (n= 4).8.3. Case 3:"
"the structural element has in the hyperstatic structure. It should be noted that although the coefficientnis reduced, it is still in a condition of safety because, for both elements, the final result is greater than the safety limit (n= 4).8.3. Case 3: 1030-2030-3030 Row of PilastersIn this case both E3010-3020and E3020-3030and for both manifestations of degradation the linguistic subjective judgment large was assigned obtaining, respectively,n= 3.00 andn= 3.25 (Table12) (the weight that each event has on the degradation of safety is different, resp., very large and large).The weightWEassociated with the element E3010-3020is large, while the weight associated with the E3020-3030is medium. As a result for the structural element E3010-3020for the weighed safety factors the values of 2.50 and 2.75 were obtained (Table12), while for the element E3020-30302.69 and 2.88 were obtained (Table12).Also in this case both the weight large and the weight medium reduce the value ofn, obtaining a safety coefficient which depends on the different weight that each structural element has in the hyperstatic structure.These values lead to an unsafe condition alert for the structural element. The weightWEthat the structural element has on the whole structure, respectively, large and medium, further reduces the safety coefficientn.8.4.

"structure, respectively, large and medium, further reduces the safety coefficientn.8.4. Results for the BeamsThe weightWEassociated with the beams is small. In the capacity design the weightWEof the beams is less than the weight of the columns of the ground floor (large) and the first floor (medium).The attribution of weights medium and large to the structural element reduces the safety factorn. This reduction is due to the importance of the element in the mechanism of collapse.The value ofnof the structural element with weightWEsmall depends on the weight that the manifestation of degradation has on the element (Table13).9. Results of the Application to an Isostatic StructureThe use of fuzzy logic has allowed an objective result to be obtained, that is, judgment, which is influenced not only by the weight of the manifestation of degradation but also by its localization within the structure. This method was applied to a bridge placed along a road, the SS 195 in Cagliari (Italy), suffering from forms of degradation related to the ULS. The aim of this study is to manipulate through fuzzy logic the subjective linguistic judgments expressed by the inspecting staff on the visual signs of degradation in order to assess the current safety level of the deck of the bridge [15].In the procedure it was decided to give simple linguistic judgements on the level of degradation and not to make any measurements because often, as in the case under examination, the structural elements are not"
"safety level of the deck of the bridge [15].In the procedure it was decided to give simple linguistic judgements on the level of degradation and not to make any measurements because often, as in the case under examination, the structural elements are not easy to reach. The presence of water under the bridge physically prevents the measurements of the damage, at least not without considerable cost.The manifestations of degradation common to beamsEiare as follows: corrosion of the longitudinal lower barsEi2and the consequent detachment of the concrete coverEi1(two manifestations of degradation for the elementEi). These manifestations are present, in some elements, over the entire length of the beam, while in other places they are located in areas of limited extension.The corrosion of the lower longitudinal bars, in this case, has different weight when localized at the middle rather than at the ends. Indeed, in a simply supported beam (static scheme of the present case) the kinematic collapse is unique and it occurs when a plastic hinge is formed in the middle.

ConclusionsIn this paper a procedure suitable for the manipulation and interpretation of subjective linguistic judgments was developed resulting from a visual inspection of a construction, in order to assess, in a more objective and reliable way, the safety level of the building under examination.With the application of the proposed method, the visual inspection is \"translated\" into an objective examination of the state of deterioration of the structures under investigation. The numerical evaluation of the safety factornallows safety inspector to program targeted maintenance and in severe cases, which may involve a structural risk, perform more detailed investigations and consequently to set priorities of due actions.

"risk, perform more detailed investigations and consequently to set priorities of due actions. The peculiarity of the proposed method resides in separating the subjective aspect of the linguistic judgement of the gravity of the damageGijkfrom the objective aspect, which is the weightWijklthat the damage has on the safety and the weightWEijklmthat the element has within the structure. This method provides a quick, low cost, and reliable way of assessing the evolution of degradation in a building.All the information coming from the visual inspections is managed, evaluated, and processed, thus realizing a management information system based on the authors' software.Software is developed by the authors which implements their fuzzy logic procedure applied to lexical subjective judgements. The evolution of this procedure described in this paper not only considers the weight associated with the manifestation of degradation but also takes into consideration the weight that each element has on overall structural safety. This allows a specific assessment of detail and a broader assessment of the condition of the building as a whole taking into account the morphology of the structural system.Interesting results were obtained in the applications described in the previous publications [12-15].In this way, the costs resulting from this type of investigation are relatively low with no detriment on the reliability of the result which is reflected in the value of the safety factorn.This"
"applications described in the previous publications [12-15].In this way, the costs resulting from this type of investigation are relatively low with no detriment on the reliability of the result which is reflected in the value of the safety factorn.This information management system allows safety operators to sort the data resulting from visual inspection of the structures even when structural number is relevant. For each structure under study, the authors' system returns the safety factornfor each structural element.The goal of the proposed method is to evaluate and manage all the information coming from visual inspections. In this way, experts can, through the evaluation of the safety factorn, assess with homogenous criteria the state of conservation of the structures under investigation, so that within a facility or across multiple facilities a hierarchy of interventions can be created.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.References1Frangopol D.

"AbstractObjectivesThis study sought to (1) determine the number of persons evicted from the Durham Housing Authority (DHA) over a 5-year period, (2) explore changes in the number of persons with various medical diagnoses and health care utilization patterns before and after eviction, and (3) examine how many persons evicted from DHA became literally homeless.DesignThis was a pre/post cross-sectional quantitative study.SampleHeads of households evicted from DHA properties from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017 were included in the study.MeasurementsWe matched people evicted by the DHA in a university health system electronic health record system to determine changes in diagnoses and health care utilization before and after eviction. We also matched the cohort in the homeless management information system to determine how many persons evicted became literally homeless.ResultsFindings indicate statistically significant increases in persons with medical diagnoses in five of ten categories, total hospital admissions, and emergency department visits after eviction. Of the 152 people included in the study, 34 (22%) became literally homeless.ConclusionsHealth and health care utilization patterns were different before and after eviction.

"eviction. Implications for clinicians are explored.1 INTRODUCTIONEviction is a national crisis. From 2000 to 2016, there was an eviction filing for approximately 1 in every 17 renter households, and 1 in every 40 renter households were evicted (Eviction Lab,2018). Studies on the health issues of persons experiencing homelessness are increasing; however, there is a dearth of literature on the health and health care utilization patterns of individuals evicted from their housing. Little is known about the health of individuals evicted from public housing and whether eviction from public housing leads to literal homelessness. This study reports (a) the characteristics of heads of households evicted from Durham Housing Authority (DHA) public housing over a 5-year period, (b) their health diagnoses, (c) their health care utilization patterns before and after eviction, and (d) their use of homeless services that would indicate literal homelessness after eviction. For the purpose of this study, we used the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Category 1 Literally Homeless definition, which includes having nighttime residence in places not intended for human habitation (e.g., emergency shelters, vehicles, unsheltered) but excludes residing temporarily with friends or family (HUD, n.d.).Despite economic growth, income stagnation for most low- and middle-class Americans has negatively affected their ability to obtain affordable housing over the past three decades; in"
"but excludes residing temporarily with friends or family (HUD, n.d.).Despite economic growth, income stagnation for most low- and middle-class Americans has negatively affected their ability to obtain affordable housing over the past three decades; in 2018, 50% of renters in America spent more than 30% of their income on housing (National Low Income Housing Coalition,2019). This economic barrier to access continues to fuel a rising rate of eviction. Most evictions affect low-income Black households and may lead to homelessness (Desmond & Kimbro,2015). A systematic review of papers published from 1900 to 2017 identified four factors associated with eviction: financial hardship, sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, and other health problems (Tsai & Huang,2019). Eviction and the threat of eviction are linked to irreparable harm affecting physical and mental health outcomes in both children and adults (Desmond & Kimbro,2015; Vasquez-Vera et al., 2017).Stable housing is associated with improved health and reduced health care costs (Sandel & Desmond,2017). Housing instability can be detrimental to health and has been associated with increased alcohol use as well as substance use disorder and exposure to violence (Tsai & Huang,2019), an increase in sexually transmitted infections (Niccolai et al.,2019), and adverse birth outcomes (Khadka et al.,2020).

"(Tsai & Huang,2019), an increase in sexually transmitted infections (Niccolai et al.,2019), and adverse birth outcomes (Khadka et al.,2020). Chronic illness frequently precedes eviction, but eviction can exacerbate preexisting health conditions in healthy individuals and may result in poor health outcomes (Tsai & Huang,2019; Vasquez-Vera, et al., 2017). Eviction is also associated with suicide (Fowler et al.,2015) as well as increased utilization of services for mental health and substance use disorders (Cusack & Montgomery,2017).1.1 Public housingIn 1937, the U.S. Housing Act established permanent public housing funded by the federal government under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], 2020). The aim was to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. Public housing is available in all 50 states. Rent for public housing is based on household income. HUD administers federal aid to local agencies (i.e., housing authorities) that manage public housing, oversee housing programs, and furnish technical and professional assistance in planning, developing, and managing these housing units. In 2017, there were approximately 2.1 million low-income Americans residing in public housing (Center on Budget & Policy Priorities,2017).1.1.1 Durham housing authority (DHA)Durham Housing Authority, established in 1949, is a"

In 2017, there were approximately 2.1 million low-income Americans residing in public housing (Center on Budget & Policy Priorities,2017).1.1.1 Durham housing authority (DHA)Durham Housing Authority, established in 1949, is a public housing authority funded by HUD. In order to qualify for DHA's Public Housing program, an individual must■have an annual income at or below 80% of the median income for the area, adjusted for family size,■have at least one family member who is either a U.S. citizen or an eligible immigrant, and■provide proof of Social Security numbers for every family member.Families are also subject to DHA's suitability screening criteria, which include, but are not limited to, previous rental and tenancy history and past criminal activity. At the time of this study, DHA owned and managed 12 public housing communities that offered a total of 1,409 units, 50% of which were occupied by female heads of household with children.Public housing is the housing safety net for many low-income families, elderly persons, and individuals with disabilities (Galvez et al.,2017). Evidence suggests that public housing residents have a higher prevalence of diabetes, asthma, and hypertension than persons living in other housing situations (Ruel et al.,2010) and higher rates of smoking and less fruit and vegetable consumption than general population samples (Noonan et al.,2017).

"persons living in other housing situations (Ruel et al.,2010) and higher rates of smoking and less fruit and vegetable consumption than general population samples (Noonan et al.,2017). Loss of housing assistance may result in homelessness or living in overcrowded housing (Smith et al.,2014), which can exacerbate health conditions or contribute to early mortality. These factors make public-housing residents particularly vulnerable to the poor health outcomes associated with eviction.In 2017, Durham residents identified affordable housing as the top community health priority and expressed concern that eviction had reached crisis levels (Durham County, NC Department of Public Health,2017). Between 2013 and 2016, more than 50% of Durham rental households were rent-burdened, with residents paying more than 30% of their household income towards rent (DataWorks NC, n.d.) During this period, Durham's eviction rate decreased from 6.75% to 5.07% but remained higher than the national rate, which was under 3% (Eviction Lab,2018). Amid this housing crisis, we could find little current data on how eviction affects the health of individuals living in public housing. Through this research project, we sought to answer the following questions:In the 5-year period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, how many individuals were evicted from DHA public housing communities?What were the mental and physical health conditions of the cohort before and after eviction?What were the health service"

Prior to data collection, data-sharing agreements were established between DHA and DUHS and between NCCEH and DUHS. The agreements are formal contracts included in the institutional review board (IRB) process that details data security measures. The Duke Health IRB approved all study activities.2.2 SampleThe sample included heads of households who were evicted from DHA properties during the 5-year period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017.

"Identifying the sample from DHA and then matching electronic health record data with entry into the homeless system were separate processes as described below.2.2.1 Identifying the sample within DHATo identify individuals who had been evicted from DHA properties during the study period, financial records of court costs associated with 12 properties were searched for transaction amounts indicating a filing for eviction between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. These data were exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and cross-checked across properties to capture individuals who may have moved between properties during the study period. Financial transactions were then organized chronologically. Individuals were identified when the most recent transactions on their accounts showed a charge of $126 for filing an eviction, followed by a charge of $55 for a writ of possession. Move-out dates served as confirmation; however, individuals were excluded if (a) the anticipated move-out dates were outside of the study dates, (b) clear documentation of accounting errors was found, or (c) later transactions indicated that a resolution was reached prior to the court date. An additional subset of individuals was excluded because they had transactions indicating a filing for eviction and a move-out date but no charge for the writ of possession. These individuals were assumed to have moved of their own volition before the eviction process was finalized (See Figure1). The names, dates"

"A total of 231 evicted persons (90%) were identified and matched using this procedure. We later learned that the wrong date of birth had been given for 11 of the initial 258 evictees, which resulted in their exclusion from the study.All available data between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017 were abstracted for each participant. Variables included participant characteristics (e.g., gender, race, age at encounter, insurance status), utilization data (all DUHS and FQHC encounters including date, type, and location), and diagnoses information (source, diagnosis name, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes). Data accuracy was ensured by verifying that encounter types were restricted to valid encounters; encounters such as \"Deleted Record-Please Ignore\" and \"Committee Review\" were excluded as these reflect nonclinical entries.2.2.3 Verifying entries into homelessness after evictionThe names, dates of birth, and addresses of persons evicted from DHA within the study period were shared with the NCCEH for matching within the HMIS. HMIS is a technology platform for entering, storing, and transferring client data from homeless service providers to HUD. HUD-funded service providers are mandated to use the HMIS system.

DHA and the primary DUHS hospitals and clinics associated with this study are located within the CoCs maintained by NCCEH. Prior to data transfer, NCCEH and the study PI received permission from the three CoC leads for HMIS data to be used in the study. All data were de-identified at the CoC and agency levels prior to transfer via a secure electronic platform. Persons evicted who had a post-eviction entry in the HMIS system were considered to have become literally homeless per the HUD definition.2.3 Measures2.3.1 Categorization of diagnosesInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM; hereafter referred to as ICD-10) codes are used for medical documentation and billing. It is common for patients to have multiple ICD-10 codes for each encounter.

We computed descriptive statistics, means, and standard deviations for interval variables as well as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Inpatient and ambulatory health care utilization were summarized by frequencies, means, and standard deviations.Summaries of utilization before and after eviction date are presented (Table3). Because a full year of data before and after eviction was not available for every participant, each model comparing the utilization and diagnosis categories was adjusted by the observed utilization time (difference in days of the date of last encounter after eviction - date of first encounter before eviction divided by 365.25). Adjusted paired t-tests were performed to measure the difference in health care utilization before and after eviction, and conditional logistic regression adjusting for observed utilization time was used to compare the presence of diagnosis categories before and after eviction.

Of the service types, 10 single persons (83.3%) and 18 families (81.1%) utilized an emergency shelter. Rapid rehousing was utilized by 16 (72.7%) of families but only by one single person. The remaining housing and supportive services were not utilized as readily.4 DISCUSSIONThis study characterizes residents who were evicted from public housing in Durham, North Carolina; their most common health conditions grouped by ICD-10 codes; and changes in the number of persons experiencing those health conditions before and after eviction. All diagnoses categories demonstrated increases in the number of people with those health conditions post eviction, and these increases were statistically significant in five of the ten categories. Previous studies have documented high levels of mental health disorders, substance use disorders, chronic illness, obesity, and disability in public housing residents (Digenis-Bury et al.,2008; Simning et al.,2011); however, to our knowledge, this is the first study to document increases in these types of diagnoses after eviction from public housing. The increase in preventative services was unexpected and was not reflected elsewhere in the literature, perhaps because housing instability often leads to postponing needed care, as previous studies have shown (Jaworsky et al.,2016; Reid et"
"housing. The increase in preventative services was unexpected and was not reflected elsewhere in the literature, perhaps because housing instability often leads to postponing needed care, as previous studies have shown (Jaworsky et al.,2016; Reid et al.,2008). This increase may represent individuals accessing care post-eviction to connect with social workers or other clinic resources. Further study is warranted.Overall, our sample demonstrated an increase in inpatient admissions and outpatient and ED visits post-eviction. The increased number of hospital admissions could suggest that individuals who were evicted experienced more medical issues needing hospitalization. This finding is supported in other studies that examine the effect of housing instability on acute care utilization, especially those that research whether individuals experiencing housing insecurity delay needed care (Buck et al.,2012; Harris et al.,2019; Jaworsky et al.,2016; Reid et al.,2008). The increased total number of ED visits after eviction could suggest that heads of household are experiencing acutely worse health or worse health care access after eviction. Other studies that have explored the relationship between ED utilization and housing instability have found similar results (Buck et al.,2012; Jaworsky et al.,2016; Marfil-Garza et al.,2018; Nosyk et al.,2007; Zhang et al., 2011).

"have found similar results (Buck et al.,2012; Jaworsky et al.,2016; Marfil-Garza et al.,2018; Nosyk et al.,2007; Zhang et al., 2011). While the increase in 30-, 60-, and 90-day ED repeat visits was not statistically significant, there were substantial increases that may demonstrate that our cohort was cycling in and out of the health care system more regularly, using lower threshold but higher cost care in the ED.Interestingly, although the number of hospital admissions increased, the length of stay (indicated by overall number of bed days) decreased after eviction. The change in length of stay was not significant, but the decrease represents an interesting finding as previous studies have demonstrated that hospital stays are lengthened by factors such as low socioeconomic status and lack of social support (Lam et al.,2016; Lin et al.,2015; Rollins et al.,2012). In fact, homelessness is associated with increased length of inpatient stay (Hwang et al.,2011). Lack of a stable residence to which a person can be discharged, along with the worsening material hardship associated with eviction, likely provide impediments to earlier discharge after a hospital admission. There are a variety of interventions such as medical respite programs for homeless patients that have been tested to improve care transitions for housing unstable patients, and there is evidence that such programs can decrease the number of inpatient days (Biederman et al.,2019). It is possible that after eviction,"
"programs for homeless patients that have been tested to improve care transitions for housing unstable patients, and there is evidence that such programs can decrease the number of inpatient days (Biederman et al.,2019). It is possible that after eviction, programs such as these were utilized to help coordinate care. The decrease we found may not be fully explained by this possibility and deserves further investigation.In our study, 34 (13%) heads of households who were evicted used homeless services, indicating literal homelessness status. While it is often assumed that eviction leads to homelessness, there are few empirical U.S. studies to substantiate this claim. A Minnesota study demonstrated that about 17% of Hennepin County residents who were evicted entered the shelter system within the following 3-year period, with the majority entering the system during the year after eviction (Holdener et al.,2018). In that study, \"Black families\" and \"increased household size\" were identified as higher risk factors for shelter entry. While our sample size did not allow for risk assessment or modeling, we noted that families had greater entry into homeless services than single individuals, and that all persons with HMIS entry in our study were Black. Nonetheless, both studies demonstrate that eviction may lead to homelessness, and suggests this may be particularly true for Black families.

"our study were Black. Nonetheless, both studies demonstrate that eviction may lead to homelessness, and suggests this may be particularly true for Black families. Because homeless persons tend to have worse health and increased mortality compared to their housed peers (Fazel et al.,2014), eviction may increase health disparities. Further research to explore housing and health trajectories of persons who lose their housing through eviction is warranted.4.1 Implications for public health nursesSocial context influences health. It is imperative that clinicians explore and document social context with their patients, particularly in cases of worsening health. Addressing social determinants of health is increasingly prioritized by clinicians and health care practices across the country. However, as demonstrated in this study, documentation remains a challenge. Although the number of social diagnoses increased after eviction, less than 8% of our study participants had a documented social diagnosis reflecting housing instability. Previous studies have demonstrated low utilization of social diagnoses ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes (Biederman et al.,2019; Torres et al.,2017). Numerous groups and agencies, including the American Hospital Association and American Medical Association, advocate the use of social diagnoses ICD-10 codes and acknowledge their underuse. Challenges in documentation of social factors is common; one study of over 100 community health centers found significant variation"
"and American Medical Association, advocate the use of social diagnoses ICD-10 codes and acknowledge their underuse. Challenges in documentation of social factors is common; one study of over 100 community health centers found significant variation in how practices screened for and documented social determinants of health as well as in the number of patients screened (Cottrell et al.,2019). Clinics and hospital systems should develop standardized protocols to allow clinicians (e.g., registered nurses, social workers) to document social diagnoses with ICD-10 codes in order to reduce provider (i.e., physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) burden. Such protocols exist in the University of Wisconsin Health System (G. Klinkner, personal communication, March 21, 2017) and the Duke Outpatient Clinic (J. Gamble, personal communication, September 17, 2020).4.2 LimitationsThis study adds to the literature on health and health care utilization of persons evicted from public housing, but it is not without limitations. The method used to determine resident eviction status from financial records may have resulted in missing individuals. Persons evicted may have used health care organizations other than those included in this study or left the area immediately after eviction, resulting in their not having both before and after eviction health data and not being included in the final analyses. Persons evicted may have moved to other locations, entered other housing arrangements"
"study or left the area immediately after eviction, resulting in their not having both before and after eviction health data and not being included in the final analyses. Persons evicted may have moved to other locations, entered other housing arrangements that are tenuous but not considered indicative of homelessness, or not presented to homeless service agencies within the local and surrounding HMIS system catchment area, thus preventing them from being recognized as literally homeless. As the sample was from one city and state, results may not be generalizable to other locations. These limitations notwithstanding, our study results indicate that public housing residents, in general, have a substantial health burden that worsened after eviction, further strengthening the need for eviction prevention efforts. Advanced practice nurses and other health care providers need further education and support in documenting social determinants ICD-10 codes. Extending this documentation into the clinician (e.g. nursing, social work) realm can increase use of these codes and help to identify housing-insecure, homeless, or other socially disadvantaged populations.Open ResearchDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTResearch data are not shared.REFERENCESBiederman, D.

"AbstractAdvances in network technology have led to extensive information technology construction work in all walks of life; universities, as a key component of national development, cannot be overlooked in this regard. In today's universities, the Web-based integrated academic management information system is widely used, promoting higher education management system innovation and improving the management level of education departments and teaching management. The traditional management mode is incapable of locating \"knowledge\" in the mountains of student transcripts, and the original management mode must be improved. In business, finance, insurance, marketing, and other fields, digital exploration technology is widely used. This article describes the design approach for a data mining-based analysis and management system for PE course teaching quality, as well as the application of information technology and data mining technology in PE by combining actual PE teaching in schools, with the goal of realizing a data mining-based PE performance management system to serve PE teaching in schools and improve PE teaching quality. The results show that the time required to find frequent itemsets using a traditional algorithm running on a single machine, as well as the time required to scan the database several times for frequent itemset search in a distributed cluster of 20 computing nodes, is significantly longer than that required by the data mining algorithm.

"on a single machine, as well as the time required to scan the database several times for frequent itemset search in a distributed cluster of 20 computing nodes, is significantly longer than that required by the data mining algorithm. As a result, the proposed sports performance management system is functional, simple, and scalable, with each functional module operating independently and cooperatively, reflecting the concept of \"high cohesion and low coupling.\"1. IntroductionAlong with the expansion of college operations, the number of students is increasing year by year, and the teaching of physical education, which is an important part of school education, has sparked a wave of pedagogical reform [1]. Classroom teaching is the primary means of achieving educational goals in schools, and its effectiveness has a direct impact on the learning quality of students [2]. Colleges use improving higher education quality and cultivating special talents as the purpose of school operation in order to respond to the national call and achieve the state's higher education development goals [3]. The original grade data analysis method, on the other hand, is unable to thoroughly analyse and capture information useful for teaching and learning from large amounts of grade data, resulting in inefficient use of teaching information resources. This has resulted in grade management based primarily on simple statistical analysis, such as processing student identity. Data mining [4,5] is a vital"
"from large amounts of grade data, resulting in inefficient use of teaching information resources. This has resulted in grade management based primarily on simple statistical analysis, such as processing student identity. Data mining [4,5] is a vital information processing technique [6,7] that has been widely adopted in a variety of industries around the world, generating significant economic and social value.The service that universities provide to students as a \"service-oriented enterprise\" is \"education.\" We can only \"produce\" a high-quality product--graduates--and establish a brand name in the education market by continuously and effectively improving education quality [8]. Knowledge and rules in the knowledge base are created by experts or programmers using external input in traditional decision support systems [9]. Data mining is an automatic process of acquiring knowledge from within a system with the goal of discovering undiscovered knowledge in a large amount of data [10]. Online query and analysis can be used to process information that is clearly understood by decision-makers [11]. It is beneficial to motivate teachers, improve teaching quality, and strengthen faculty construction and scientific management by establishing a good teaching quality evaluation mechanism [12].Many schools now conduct physical activity and achievement tests for their students [13].

"a good teaching quality evaluation mechanism [12].Many schools now conduct physical activity and achievement tests for their students [13]. The majority of these post-test scores, however, are only saved as data or files in school computers, and these students are unaware of their physical condition despite having completed the relevant physical fitness tests [14]. Analysing and processing these massive amounts of data using traditional data analysis and data query validation methods are not only computationally intensive but also completely reliant on pre-assumed and estimated data relationships. In data, there is a growing demand for tacit knowledge [15]. The use of parallel computing and data-mining arithmetic can help to solve this problem to a large extent, because parallel computing can provide the computational power required to process large amounts of data, and clusters can scale up the computational power as the data grows. In response to the problems and current state of PE in universities, relevant information is compiled, and modern data mining techniques are fully employed to automate the processing and analysis of large amounts of sports data in order to assist students. Professors and consultants analyse statistical data.

In this paper, technology for digital exploration is introduced into the performance analysis of the university teaching system, with the goal of identifying factors affecting students' performance and specifically improving teaching quality. The innovative points of this paper are as follows:(1)Using data mining techniques to uncover possible hidden relevant factors that affect teachers' teaching level, provide specific indications for improving teaching level, and apply them to teaching practice.(2)Research and analysis of existing student data information using association rule extraction technology, and statistical analysis of some factors affecting teaching quality in schools using scientific methods, so as to evaluate teaching quality and student learning quality.(3)The purpose of the analysis and management system of PE curriculum with quality according to data mining algorithm is to enhance the productivity and accuracy of PE teachers in schools, free them from tedious and boring work, and then improve their management-level teaching quality.The first part of this paper introduces the background and significance of the study, and then introduces the main work of this paper.

Quality Analysis and Management System of PE Course TeachingTo enhance the cultural qualification of all the people, China's higher education has made rapid progress, with major breakthroughs in system reform, successive expansion of various colleges and universities, and leapfrog development in the scale of college operation.

"education, if the physical health training of young people is neglected. Therefore, classroom teaching quality monitoring has great significance as an essential component of the university's education quality supervision mechanism, and the study and improvement of the teacher classroom teaching quality evaluation system is one of the hot spots and priorities of the current higher education evaluation of quality management.From the perspective of effectiveness, Cao defined teaching quality evaluation as the evaluation process, which is essentially the process of determining the extent to which curricula and learning programmes actually achieve educational goals [16]. Cui and Yoon proposed a decision tree data extraction method that combines this algorithm with the SLIQ algorithm and applies it to a database of student grades to analyse various data and build a decision tree model through analysis [17]. Parmezan et al. proposed a teacher teaching quality assessment questionnaire that includes nine dimensions such as teaching quality, value of learning, enthusiasm for teaching, teaching organization and clarity, group interaction, interpersonal harmony, breadth of knowledge, examinations and test scores, homework, and other reading materials [18].

Zhang et al. conducted an in-depth study on mining techniques and proposed the ID3 algorithm to manage the university faculty-related data was extracted and analysed to discover correlations between various course environments with a view to providing data university decision reference [19]. Yin discussed the application of distortion-resistant algorithms in mining association rules. This algorithmic technique significantly reduces the number of database scans by a factor of even less than two. The algorithm with the shortest scanning time is the use of sampling to collect relevant data [20].Teaching quality analysis is an important tool for evaluating teaching and learning. Data-mining arithmetic is used to analyse data generated from examination processes and teaching sessions at multiple levels and perspectives. Utilizing the analysis results to assist teaching decisions is an inevitable requirement for assuring teaching excellence and enhancing the quality as well as the overall competence of students and teachers.2.2. Data-Mining ArithmeticGiven the current rapid development of higher education, self-monitoring of school teaching quality has become an important guarantee for scientific administration, and the development and implementation of teaching quality evaluation systems has become an important tool for implementing teaching control.

"and the development and implementation of teaching quality evaluation systems has become an important tool for implementing teaching control. Currently, digital exploration technology is widely used in telecommunications, commerce, banking, and enterprise production and marketing, but it has a limited use in education. As a result, this research focuses on the performance analysis characteristics of PE courses and integrates them with practical work to propose a data mining-based algorithm for identifying the keys that have the greatest impact on students and enhancing their learning experience. Dan and Li classify the original data set for large-scale data sets, analyse the OS virtual memory implementation mechanism, and improve the original FP-GROWTH algorithm in terms of spatial and temporal locality to make it a mining algorithm with perceptual input and output [21]. Gong and Lin proposed a multivariate strategy, which combines previous mining and discovery techniques and applies them to the qualification database to help universities make better decisions. To assist teachers in making teaching decisions, the results of each subject are computed, as well as a performance analysis report and related analysis table [22].

"The hardware and software infrastructures for distributed association rule mining algorithms were investigated by Atta-ur-Rahman and DaSh. They looked at distributed data mining algorithms, parallel mining algorithms, and distributed parallel databases [23]. Li et al. discussed the Apriori association rule algorithm and the well-known decision tree ID3 algorithm, as well as their application scope [24]. Huang used a similar algorithm, Random-kmeans [25], to sample the original data set statistically and pool the smaller data set after sampling. The relationships and trends that are hidden in large amounts of data are beyond the ability of even the experts who manage these data to discover, and this information is potentially and critically important for decision-making, which is what data mining aims to solve.3. Design Ideas of Teaching Quality Analysis and Management System of PE Courses Based on Data-Mining Arithmetic3.1. System Functional Module DesignAn important task of the generic system design phase is to determine how the system will accomplish the intended functionality using a more abstract and generic approach [26]. Thus, the overall design phase has three main subphases, starting with the test type management module, followed by the test project management module, and finally the result management module. Data mining is the complete process of extracting previously unknown, valid, and useful information from a database through data mining tools and using this"
"module, followed by the test project management module, and finally the result management module. Data mining is the complete process of extracting previously unknown, valid, and useful information from a database through data mining tools and using this information for decision-making or knowledge enrichment. The system functional module diagram is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem function module.First, the test type management module completes data preprocessing [27] and management of sports event types, including adding, modifying, deleting, and configuring the weights of event types. Data preprocessing is mainly done by cleaning, integrating, selecting, transforming, and conceptually layering data attributes to form tuples from the data training set. The information entropy of sample classification is as follows:(1)The construction of the teaching quality evaluation system includes two aspects: the determination of indicators and the determination of weights. Indicators are specific, measurable operational and behavioural goals of a particular aspect; that is, they do not reflect the complete goal, but only one aspect of the goal. Simultaneous comparative analysis of factor data of different dimensions requires their standardization. The value ofifactorjin all samples is as follows:(2)whereμjis the mean value of theith factor andσjis the standard deviation of thejth factor.The business problems to be mined are identified by a detailed"
"dimensions requires their standardization. The value ofifactorjin all samples is as follows:(2)whereμjis the mean value of theith factor andσjis the standard deviation of thejth factor.The business problems to be mined are identified by a detailed understanding of the raw data to be extracted and the business problems to be applied in practice before starting data mining. In data mining, determining the purpose of mining is crucial. Mining produces unpredictable results, but the problem to be mined must be predictable, and mining blindness must be minimized. It is necessary to determine whether the test type contains test elements. It is impossible to remove something that already exists. Otherwise, the deletion procedure is carried out. Figure2depicts the programme flow for performing this function.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointProcess of test type deletion programme.Secondly, the evidence project management module completes the operations of adding, modifying, deleting, and setting weights of sports evidence items. Due to the large amount of data, among these data, the required data suitable for this data mining are selected to establish a data mining library [28]. It generally includes data selection, selection of relevant data, noise, data purification and elimination, inference of missing data, conversion of discrete-valued data to continuous-valued data, grouping, and classification of data values. Each itemset needs to carry a decision attributed, and when"
"of relevant data, noise, data purification and elimination, inference of missing data, conversion of discrete-valued data to continuous-valued data, grouping, and classification of data values. Each itemset needs to carry a decision attributed, and when performing a join to produce a candidatek+ 1 itemset, two frequentkitemsets that can undergo the join operation must satisfy(3)As a result, the test management module enables the administration and maintenance of classroom quality assessment programmes, as well as the adjustment of the number of test questions or test content as needed. An independent internal hierarchy to describe the functions or characteristics of the system is created based on the requirements of the questions, and a judgement matrix of higher-level elements is created by comparing the relative importance of factors or objectives, criteria, and plans. To get a sequence of relative importance of relevant elements to higher level elements, a recursive hierarchy is built. Confidence thresholds must be set in order to extract rules from a set of frequent items and calculate the confidence level of the bar rule when extracting sports databases using the active search mining algorithm.(4)Finally, the score management module completes the operations of adding, modifying, deleting, querying, exporting, and grading system conversion of students' sports test scores.

The incomplete, noisy, and random data are sorted out, and the unwanted data are cleaned. SupposeSis the set ofsdata specimens, and the expected amount of information required to classify a given sample assuming that the class label attribute has a distinct value(5)Then, according to the data mining objectives and data characteristics, appropriate analysis models are selected for the data-mining arithmetic and the data are transformed. The module can classify courses. Different assessment items can be set for each course type. For courses that do not require assessment, you can also set up multiteacher classes to allow for more specific assessment of students. Relevant factors are broken down into levels based on their attributes from top to bottom, with each factor at the same level being subordinate to, or having an influence on, the higher level factor, while dominating the lower level or being influenced by the lower level factor. Then, using a prototype system, developers brainstorm with users to iteratively modify and expand the prototype until the final system is formed.3.2.

"PE Database Logic DesignThe database logical design determines the overall performance of the database and its applications, tuning location [29]. If the database logic is poorly designed, all tuning methods will have limited effect on improving the database performance. The flow of data mining is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointProcess of data mining.First, the conceptual structure is transformed into the corresponding data model, such as relational model, network model, and hierarchical model. The data are cleaned, synthesized and filtered from data sources, and then entered into the database for data mining, pattern evaluation, and knowledge representation. According to the level of abstraction of datum in the proposed rule, association rules can be classified into single-level correlations and multiple-level correlations. KL scatter, also known as relative entropy, is used in the field of statistics to calculate the degree of agreement of two probability distributions, and in the area of machine knowledge to measure the closeness of two functions, and is calculated as follows:(6)Single-level association rules do not consider the hierarchical nature of the actual data attributes, but simply describe the attributes of the data [30]. Metadata is the core of the data warehouse and is used to store data models, define data structures, transformation planning, data warehouse structure, and control information. The management part includes data security,"
"the attributes of the data [30]. Metadata is the core of the data warehouse and is used to store data models, define data structures, transformation planning, data warehouse structure, and control information. The management part includes data security, archiving, backup, maintenance, and recovery. The index interval [a,b] of the soft constraint is given based on empirical data and detects whether there exists a solution within the initial solution setTthat meets the requirements of the soft constraint. If it exists, it is marked as a feasible solution; otherwise, the parameter range of the constrained indicator interval is adjusted until a feasible solution exists; assuming thatBis a diagonal matrix, the above formula can be transformed into the following form.(7)wherebijrepresents thei,jdata attribute in the database.In this step, data will be extracted and integrated from the operational environment, semantic ambiguities will be resolved, dirty data will be removed, etc. The process of summing data and calculating data averages are both statistical methods, and the results of these calculations are represented by certain graphs, such as histograms and pie charts. The absolute value function of the factor coefficients in the regression equation is added to the model as a penalty term to make some regression coefficients smaller.

"the regression equation is added to the model as a penalty term to make some regression coefficients smaller. By regression, the coefficients of factors whose absolute values are not sufficient to explain the dependent variable can be changed directly to 0. The expression of the LASSO method can be written as follows:(8)Next, these data models are converted into data models that can be supported by the corresponding database management system. First, all frequent itemsets in the data set are found, and the itemsets that satisfy the minimum support threshold are called frequent itemsets, and then, association rules are generated from these frequent itemsets, mainly by extracting frequent itemsets from all the generated high confidence levels. As a large amount of detailed and descriptive data is stored in the data warehouse, the data set is relatively large and requires a large number of join operations between relational tables to respond to the user's analysis request, increasing the response time user. But the data are stored only once, saving space compared to MOLAP, and analysis can get more detailed data; that is, the granularity of analysis can be relatively fine. So, the branching of attributes is carried out cyclically, and the information gain is the entropy compression expected after knowing the value of the attributes, which is given by the formula:(9)The database is logically divided into several disconnected blocks, each of which is considered individually and"
"and the information gain is the entropy compression expected after knowing the value of the attributes, which is given by the formula:(9)The database is logically divided into several disconnected blocks, each of which is considered individually and for which all frequency sets are generated. The generated frequency sets are then combined to generate all possible frequency sets, and finally, the support of these element sets is calculated. It is possible to distinguish the similarity of tedious repetitive data in the database, and feature vectors can describe the relevant data with high similarity in the database. The variation parameters of the different features of the data attributes can be calculated using the following formula:(10)Finally, the association rules are verified and the transformed model is optimized. If the extracted rules meet the evaluation mechanism's requirements, the knowledge is sent to the evaluation system and stored in the knowledge base. The knowledge is also stored in the knowledge base if the extracted rules do not meet the evaluation system's requirements. The indexing strategy, data storage location, and storage allocation operation are all determined. Data modelling is needed after determining the data warehouse information to be searched to determine the process of extracting, cleaning, and transforming data from data sources to data warehouse, analysing and dividing dimensions, and determining the physical data storage structure.

The primary goal of grade data processing in the academic affairs system is to unify and disambiguate data types. Data decomposition reads data from segmented blocks into memory for processing and then merges all processing results, overcoming the memory bottleneck and improving data set extraction efficiency.4. Analysis of Data-Mining Arithmetic in PE Teaching Quality Analysis and Management System4.1. Data Point Set Compression and Discard AnalysisWhen the data-mining arithmetic performs in-memory clustering, the data point set is clustered in general and the resulting clusters are marked as the main clusters, and then, the data set in the main clusters is discarded and compressed for deletion. The main memory space reads the data to be clustered again and continues clustering until all clustering work is completed. By setting the maximum available size of the programme, it is shown that this data-mining arithmetic can extract association rules for large data sets in a small memory space. A comparison of the system CPU and GC activity is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of CPU and GC activities.First, the discarding process is completed in two steps, which are called primary discarding and secondary"
"space. A comparison of the system CPU and GC activity is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of CPU and GC activities.First, the discarding process is completed in two steps, which are called primary discarding and secondary discarding. The IP of the data node is obtained from the configuration file, so each node must be a static IP address. The specific configuration table of IP of this system is shown in Table1.Table  1.IP-specific configuration table.Machine nameMaskerSlave 1Slave 2Slave 3IP address192.168.5.23192.168.5.34192.168.5.25192.168.5.31AttributeName nodeData nodeData nodeData nodeThe main idea of these two discard processes is to move the points that do not change the cluster attributes out of the main storage and store them in the discarded data set. The points in the marker set are not involved in this process and always guide the mining process. Information entropy, called entropy in information theory, is used to measure the average value of the transmitted information. Here, since the process of generating frequent itemsets from candidate itemsets must pass through the database, the most critical part of this process is how to generate the minimum number of candidate itemsets correctly. Therefore, for processing, users classify the data according to their needs and then extract the different parts, thus increasing the extraction speed.

"correctly. Therefore, for processing, users classify the data according to their needs and then extract the different parts, thus increasing the extraction speed. The statistical experiment time also does not include the time to write the discovered itemsets to disk in order to accurately count the running time of each algorithm. The support levels are set to 5 and 10, and each algorithm is executed 5 times at each support level, and the average of the statistical record execution time is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointRunning time of the system with different durations.Secondly, the main idea of the compression process is to replace high-density regions during the pooling process to clean up the main storage space. It divides the recommendation process into two parts: offline and online. The offline part constructs a cluster using the similarity between users and uses the average rating value of the users in the group as the centre of the group. The set of data points within this region has the same category affiliation and the categories change as a whole. The breast cancer data set was preprocessed, and files of different sizes were obtained by backup. Each file size is approximately 150 million and contains 2 million transaction records.

It only needs to scan the transactional database twice, and does not generate a large number of temporary intermediate key-value pairs, and takes advantage of parallelization very efficiently.Thus, it can be considered as a whole and can keep its grouping information and have sufficient statistical information. According to the rules defined by the data definition component, the data from the data source are extracted into the data warehouse, cleansing, and transformation; integration work is done; the data are loaded into the data warehouse; the data warehouse data are periodically cleansed; inconsistencies between data are eliminated data storage and source databases; and invalid data are eliminated.

"and source databases; and invalid data are eliminated. A basic principle is that when a transaction does not contain a large set of lengthk, it should not contain a large set of lengthk+ 1. The information transferred at the source consists of a limited number of mutually exclusive joint complete events, all of which occur with a certain probability. The effect of the size of the data set on the clustering algorithm is tested by varying the size of the data set and fixing the size of the storage space. The results are shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointQuality scene of each cluster when the real data set is increasing.Finally, when semisupervised clustering is performed for the data points, labels, SS, and OUTS in the main memory, the data points contained in them are not involved in the compression and discard, thus allowing the set to guide the mining in the main memory all the time. If the description is a model of linking relationships between pages, the logical description can be in the form of a matrix. When mining with aggregate data not only does the mining time increase accordingly, the useful rules are drowned in a sea of rules that are not of interest to the user, but there may be rules that cannot be mined due to the \"dilution\" of the overall data.

"cannot be mined due to the \"dilution\" of the overall data. Each element of the matrix indicates whether the node represented by the matrix row label to the node represented by the matrix column label is related, which is the hyperlink between the pages in the domain. If the consistency index test passes, the consistency design of the judgement matrix is reasonable, and the corresponding weights reflected by the feature vector are also relatively reasonable.4.2. Analysis of Clustering Process of Large-Scale Data SetsFor a certain scale of transaction database, which contains a particularly large number of candidate itemsets, a transaction can also contain many candidate itemsets, so the number of candidate itemsets will be the main factor limiting the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a large-scale data set clustering process to abstractly describe the various network linkage relationships in reality. At the same time, it is necessary to find a suitable data structure in a high-level language to store the mathematical model in a structured way in the computer, which is easy to analyse and process in the high-level language. To compare the performance of DISK-MINE, DRBFP-MINE, and data mining test algorithms on large-scale data sets, experiments were conducted using a combination of records generated from 2000 different items, and the comparison results are shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance comparison and"
"test algorithms on large-scale data sets, experiments were conducted using a combination of records generated from 2000 different items, and the comparison results are shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance comparison and analysis of large-scale data set algorithms.First, data points from the data set are sequentially read (or otherwise read) into a finite memory called a pipeline until the pipeline's space is filled. The distance between data points is calculated, the data's neighbourhood is determined, the sample's centroid is determined based on the density of the neighbourhood, and the data's global centroid is determined for sampled data. Based on the sample centroids' data, the criterion for selecting the attribute is the information entropy. The information entropy value is calculated based on the data, and then, the sizes of each information entropy are compared, with the largest information entropy being chosen as the selection criterion. The element's information entropy is calculated, and it serves as the decision tree's root node. While all variants of the one-level correlation rule ignore the fact that practical data are multilevel, the multilevel character of the data has been adequately taken into account in the multilevel correlation rule.The data points in the pipeline are then subjected to semisupervised clustering on finite primary storage until convergence.

"taken into account in the multilevel correlation rule.The data points in the pipeline are then subjected to semisupervised clustering on finite primary storage until convergence. The entropy value of the system is minimized after using this property to divide the example set into subsets, and the average path from the nonleaf nodes to each descendant leaf node is expected to be the shortest, resulting in a small decision tree. The proposed data to be handled will be related to multiple dimensions using multidimensional correlation rules. In addition, the set of points removed from the main storage goes through a triad after each stage of the discard and compression process, preserving the data point information and grouping information. Density validation and sampling centroids can be done in order, but this takes a long time with large sample sizes and long sampling times, and the sample validation centroids are useless. As a result, it is necessary to consider various influencing factors and compensate each factor appropriately, integrate factors with similar influence, and consider the distribution width and representativeness of factors appropriately during the actual evaluation operation. The comparative analysis of clustering time with positive and negative constraints is shown in Figure8to study the influence of the amount of information of equivalent partial constraints on the quality of clustering results and clustering efficiency.Figure 8Open in figure"

The data point sets that satisfy the compression conditions are replaced and the corresponding data points are removed from the main memory. The higher the entropy of a training sample set in terms of target classification, the messier and messier it is; the lower the entropy of a training sample set in terms of target classification, the clearer and more ordered it is. The correctness of the algorithm is guaranteed by all possible frequencies established at least in the given block. The online part first calculates the similarity between the target user and the centre of the cluster, then divides the target user into the most similar clusters, and finally finds the nearest neighbours of the target user in the cluster, and then performs item recommendation. In this process, the data points in the algorithm design set can change the attributes of the clusters and also allow new clusters that were not originally in the original set to appear, avoiding wrong labels in the initial set and making the algorithm somewhat fault-tolerant.5.

ConclusionsPE to serve the daily physical education in school is an integral step in today's information age. Student evaluation is the system that makes up the most of the teaching quality monitoring system at universities and plays the most important role. The common practise is to use information technology and network technology to assess and predict teaching quality. The ability to apply complex statistical methods and calculations to these data and the rapid access to big data by data mining provide exciting reasons for the rapid development of data mining. Data mining techniques in teaching management, particularly in teaching quality evaluation systems, will provide some data support for university administrators, allowing them to improve teaching quality and make more effective decisions. Using computers to evaluate teaching quality can simplify and improve management. In this paper, we propose a data-mining arithmetic-based design of a teaching quality analysis and management system for PE courses, with the goal of standardizing the workflow related to sports performance management, achieving scientific management and information management, transforming the traditional complex teachers' workplace, and increasing work efficiency through the"

"AbstractNigeria's 2009-2013 malaria strategic plan adopted WHO diagnosis and treatment guidelines, which include the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) prior to prescribing treatment with artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). The current study explores accessibility barriers to the use of RDTs in Niger State and makes recommendations for improving the uptake of RDTs. The study employs literature review, review of data from the Niger State Health Management Information System for January-October 2013, and application of Peters' conceptual framework for assessing access to health services. Data showed that 27 percent of public health facilities (HFs) implemented RDTs, with the aid of donor funds. In these facilities, 77 percent of fever cases presented during the study period were tested with RDTs; 53 percent of fever cases were confirmed cases of malaria, while 60 percent of fever cases were treated. Stockouts of RDTs were a major constraint, and severe fever tended to trigger presumptive treatment. We conclude that although implementation of RDTs led to a reduction in the use of ACTs at HFs, more substantial reduction could be achieved if the state government directed more resources towards the acquisition of RDTs as well as raising the level of awareness of potential users.1.
