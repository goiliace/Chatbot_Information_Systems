"At the same time, efficient hotel front desk management will save more time for the occupants, and it will also provide more convenience for the occupants. The provision of hotel management level will provide occupants with a more comfortable and warmer accommodation environment, and it will also provide more convenience for hotel managers [4,5]. With the wide application of intelligence in various fields, the intelligent management of hotels is also a popular direction. The intelligent management of hotels will not only improve the efficiency and service level of hotel front desk management but also bring certain convenience to the intelligent management of guest rooms [6,7]. The intelligent management of guest rooms will bring more convenience, comfort, and safety to the occupants, and it will also save human and material resources for hotel operators. The intelligent development of the hotel needs to have a solution suitable for the hotel style. It cannot ignore the feelings of the occupants just to achieve intelligence. The intelligent development of hotel management needs to make the occupants feel more technological elements, and it cannot bring more troubles to the occupants.Artificial intelligence technology is the product of the rapid development of computer computing power and the improvement of hardware technology [8].

"product of the rapid development of computer computing power and the improvement of hardware technology [8]. Artificial intelligence technology has been applied in many people's lives, and it can liberate more labor. It can also replace people to perform more dangerous and complex tasks, which has brought great convenience to people's lives [9,10]. The core of artificial intelligence technology being able to perform these tasks is that it can process these complex data very well. For hotel management, in order to realize the intelligence of hotel management, artificial intelligence is required to process the relevant data of hotel management [11]. The advantage of artificial intelligence technology is that it can better handle nonlinear and high-dimensional data. It uses nonlinear functions to find correlations in complex data. Artificial intelligence technology mainly includes three algorithms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, which are the three most common learning algorithms. Among these three algorithms, supervised learning is a more common method, whether in the field of image recognition or speech recognition.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network can better process data related to temporal features [13], and it has been widely used in speech recognition and other fields. Reinforcement learning is an algorithm with a relatively large correlation with the environment, and it is mainly used in research objects with strong environmental interference [14]. For the intelligence of hotel management, it mainly involves the spatial characteristics of data and the temporal characteristics of data.The combination of artificial intelligence technology and hotel management is an important direction for the intelligent development of hotel management. Artificial intelligence technology can optimize the management plan of the hotel management front desk, and it can also intelligently optimize the management of guest rooms. In the process of hotel's intelligent management, these data mainly involve spatial and temporal characteristics. CNN and LSTM methods are used to study the intelligent management of hotels.

The combination of artificial intelligence technology and hotel management can reduce the operating cost of hotel management, and it can also improve the operational level of hotel management. The traditional manual management mode has a large error rate. At the same time, intelligent hotel management will also meet the personalized accommodation consumption needs of the occupants, which will also improve the hotel's satisfaction rate and occupancy rate. The intelligent management of the hotel can realize the intelligent management of check-in mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and check-out mode. This will not only save the hotel operator's time and human resources but also provide greater convenience to the occupants. The CNN method is used to extract the features of in-store patterns and out-of-store patterns for hotel management. The LSTM method is mainly used to extract the temporal and spatial features of entertainment patterns and sleep patterns of hotel management.This study mainly uses CNN and LSTM algorithms to predict and study the check-in mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and check-out mode of hotel management.

Li [15] already believes that hotel management needs to meet the needs of market development in tourist cities, which is also an important part of market development. The innovative management and the provision of management level of coastal resort hotel are beneficial to improve the core competitiveness of the hotel. This study takes the management of coastal hotels as the research object, and it uses the SWOT method to analyze the relationship between the coastal hotels and the tourism supply chain. In order to realize the stable management of coastal resort hotel and improve the popularity of tourists, he proposed a platform management and construction model for coastal resort hotel. Mate-SÃ¡nchez-Val and Teruel-Gutierrez [16] have noticed that hotel location has a greater relationship with company performance and the environmental strategy of hotel management. They proposed a theoretical model to analyze the important role of hotel location in hotel management. They collected data on hotels in Barcelona as a research object, and it used peer effects to analyze the impact of hotel location on hotel performance.

Zhang et al. [17] have studied the online hotel management model, which mainly focuses on the effect of online reviews on hotel management. The dataset for this study was derived from online data on hotels in New York City on Expedia. It combines data such as online comments and online replies of online data into one dataset. It also fully mines these textual information using textual similarity. It also correlatively validates text mining functions using fixed-effects panel data. The results of the study show that consumers' online reviews do not significantly affect hotel bookings. However, highly similar responses significantly reduce hotel bookings. This research has a certain reference value for the evaluation of hotel management and online booking. Obonyo et al. [18] found that the development of ICT has provided more convenience and efficiency for hotel management. More hotels are starting to invest more in ICT to improve performance. However, this situation is weaker for economically developing countries. This study mainly analyzes the actual situation of ICT application in hotel management in Kenya.

The research results show that ICT has a strong correlation with human resource management and operational management of hotels, which will also affect the application of ICT in hotel management. Wang and Zhang [19] believe that the hotel industry has become a pillar industry of the tertiary industry. The hotel industry has developed rapidly under the rapid economic development, but it is also facing huge pressure. Based on the background of rapid development of information, this research uses the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process FAHP method to study the user decision-making process in hotel management. Based on the common data of the hotel management system, he established the customer model of the hotel business data by using the method of data mining. This method improves the service level of the hotel and enhances the core competitiveness of the hotel enterprise. Brahami and Adjaine [20] believe that only after the company or enterprise really understands the motivation management of knowledge and customer relationship management (CRM), the competitiveness of the enterprise can be improved. He also found that the two indicators of KM and CRM are less used in hotel management.

He collected sample data of large hotels in the Algeria region, and it discussed the application effect of KM and CRM in hotel performance management. The research results show that KM and CRM methods can effectively improve hotel performance, which in turn can enhance the competitiveness of hotel management. This has certain guiding significance for the further improvement of the hotel. With the development of intelligent technology and big data technology, there are also a few researchers here who have adopted artificial intelligence technology to study the related factors of hotel management and intelligent hotel management system. Ma [21] has found that the traditional concept of hotel management can no longer keep up with the pace of the times, and this method cannot provide timely training for hotel financial personnel, which leads to the relative lag of the hotel management model, which in turn affects the hotel benefit. To solve these problems, he designed an intelligent hotel financial management system. The results show that the support vector machine method and logistic regression method can reduce the risk of financial crisis in hotels.

"The response time of this intelligent hotel management system is significantly shortened, and the success rate has been improved to a certain extent. From the above literature review, it can be seen that artificial intelligence methods are rarely used in hotel management, and it rarely studies the entire process of hotel management systems. The current research is mainly to optimize and design the front desk management system of the hotel management system. This research uses CNN and LSTM methods to intelligently manage and study the hotel's in-store mode and out-of-store models.3. The Application of Artificial Intelligence Methods in Hotel Management3.1. The Importance of CNN and LSTM for Hotel ManagementThis research mainly uses CNN and LSTM algorithms to predict the in-store mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and out-of-store mode in the hotel management mode. The CNN algorithm can map the relationship between the relevant factors of the in-store management system and the needs of the occupants. This data information is often more complex, but there is a relatively large correlation between these data. Relying on hotel managers alone to find correlations in these data is more difficult. CNN can process these data well, and the CNN algorithm has strong advantages in processing these nonlinear data. The LSTM algorithm has obvious advantages in dealing with temporal features, which can deal with time-related temporal features in hotel management. For example, in the"
"well, and the CNN algorithm has strong advantages in processing these nonlinear data. The LSTM algorithm has obvious advantages in dealing with temporal features, which can deal with time-related temporal features in hotel management. For example, in the process of predicting the entertainment mode, it can automatically adjust the air conditioning system, video system, lighting system, etc. according to the change of time. Because these factors are not only strongly related to space, but also it had strongly related to time.3.2. The Hotel Management Intelligent System and CNN AlgorithmThis research will use the CNN and LSTM methods to realize the intelligent management mode of the hotel. At the same time, the in-store mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and out-of-store mode of hotel management will be unified as a whole for system design. These patterns are not a single pattern, because there are some correlations in the data between these patterns. Figure1shows the hotel's intelligent management system design scheme utilizing CNN and LSTM methods. First of all, it needs to collect more relevant data of the hotel's in-store mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and out-of-store mode as an obvious training set and test set. These data first go through the CNN algorithm, and the CNN algorithm will use the convolution layer, pooling layer, and activation function to extract the spatial features of hotel management. The LSTM will receive the output data from the CNN, which"
"set. These data first go through the CNN algorithm, and the CNN algorithm will use the convolution layer, pooling layer, and activation function to extract the spatial features of hotel management. The LSTM will receive the output data from the CNN, which will be input to the network layers of the LSTM in the form of time series. There is a backpropagation mechanism for these two networks. After the hotel management data are processed by the LSTM algorithm, it will become the control signal of the hotel room. It will automatically control the lighting system, air conditioning system, and influence system of hotel rooms. Once the model is trained, the optimal weights and biases are determined. In the actual application process, it can rely on these weights and biases to realize the prediction and analysis of the relevant data of the four modes of the hotel management information system. First, the hotel management data will be processed through data cleaning and data normalization methods. Then, these data will be processed into a matrix and input into the network layer of CNN.Open in figure viewerPowerPointCNN is a relatively common feature extraction neural network.

"has less parameters. Therefore, it allows more network layers, which guarantees the task of extracting features from hotel management system data. Figure2shows the workflow of CNN. A matrix operation is performed between each weight of the fully connected neural network. However, the weights of CNN will selectively perform matrix operations, which is the advantage of weight sharing. CNN is mainly composed of convolution layer, pooling layer, activation function, and fully connected layer. The convolutional layer will extract the features of hotel management data through parameters such as filter and stride. The pooling layer will further extract features by upsampling or downsampling. The parameters of the CNN will be trained and tested on the Tensorflow platform, and the weights and biases will be saved in the .h5 file. The learning rate chosen in this study is 0.001, which will speed up the training, but it will not easily get stuck in a local minimum.Open in figure viewerPowerPointCNN and fully connected neural network are similar computational methods, and it also has a backpropagation mechanism. The CNN dataset also contains actual numerical values, which is required by the backpropagation algorithm. Equation (1) shows how the backpropagation error is calculated.

Equation (2) is also a form of mean square error calculation, which is a form of the"

Equation (2) is also a form of mean square error calculation, which is a form of the summation of equation1:(1)(2)Many hyperparameters will be involved in the iterative calculation process of CNN, and hyperparameters will also affect the accuracy and convergence of CNN iteration. There is a certain relationship between these hyperparameters of CNN. Equation (3) shows the calculation relationship of CNN hyperparameters. Equation (4) shows the computation process of the input layer of the CNN:(3)(4)This will involve many derivative operations during the CNN computation, either forward or backward. Equation (5) shows how the weight derivative is calculated:(5)3.3. The Introduction to LSTM AlgorithmThe entertainment mode and sleep mode in the hotel management mode have a strong time relationship with the lighting system, air conditioning system, and film and television system of the guest room. The advantage of the LSTM method is that it deals with time-dependent data. For the in-store mode and the out-of-store mode, these data also have a relatively strong time relationship. Therefore, this study chooses the LSTM algorithm to process these temporally correlated data. Figure3shows the computational process of the LSTM algorithm. It differs from CNN in that it can memorize historical information because of its"
"relationship. Therefore, this study chooses the LSTM algorithm to process these temporally correlated data. Figure3shows the computational process of the LSTM algorithm. It differs from CNN in that it can memorize historical information because of its obvious gate structure. This is also the reason why it can memorize historical state information. The data input form of LSTM is time series. In this study, it will accept the output data of CNN. CNN and LSTM algorithms are a continuous process. CNN first extracts the spatial features of hotel management, and LSTM extracts the temporal features of hotel management. The gate structure of LSTM algorithm mainly includes input gate, forget gate, and output gate structure. After the hotel management data are output in the output layer of the CNN, the data will be transformed by a reshape layer. These data will be transformed into labeled data by sliding windows and sliding steps. This is because LSTM is also a supervised learning algorithm.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe LSTM algorithm is inherited from the RNN algorithm. RNN is also an important algorithm for dealing with speech recognition. Equation (6) shows the basic principle of the LSTM method to memorize historical state information. The historical state information realizes the memory of historical state information by affecting the information of the current state. Both historical state information and current state information will be given a certain weight, which can"
"information. The historical state information realizes the memory of historical state information by affecting the information of the current state. Both historical state information and current state information will be given a certain weight, which can realize the memory of historical information according to the weight. Equation (7) is the abstract structure of Equation6. Equation8shows the temporal feature information that the LSTM structure needs to load. Through Equation8, LSTM is given certain time information:(6)(7)(8)The input gate can control the input amount of information, and it can control the input characteristics of historical state information and current state information. If all the historical state information and current state information are input into the network, it will not only cause too many parameters. It also causes poor feature extraction. Equations (9) and (10) show the calculation process of the input gate. It can selectively pass historical state information and current state information according to the size of the weight:(9)(10)Equation (11) shows the calculation process of the LSTM forget gate. If the forget gates are all open, this will cause a lot of information to flow into the LSTM. The forgetting gate will assign a certain weight according to the importance of the feature, and the forgetting gate will selectively input some historical state information features according to the size of the weight:(11)Equation (11) shows how the output"
"forgetting gate will assign a certain weight according to the importance of the feature, and the forgetting gate will selectively input some historical state information features according to the size of the weight:(11)Equation (11) shows how the output gate of the LSTM method is calculated. The output gate will output features related to the current state information. This requires a gate structure for effective control. It can not only ensure the output of effective historical information but also ensure that the information parameters will not be too large:(12)4. Result Analysis and DiscussionIn this study, it mainly uses CNN and LSTM algorithms to analyze the intelligent management information system of in-store mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and out-of-store mode in hotel management. The data used in this study come from the operation data of 40 hotels in Beijing. It uses CNN and LSTM algorithms to study the accuracy and feasibility of these four hotel intelligent management modes. Figure4shows the linear correlation coefficients predicted by hotel management's in-store patterns. The linear correlation coefficient can compare the degree of agreement between the predicted value and the actual value of the intuitive response. The closer the linear correlation coefficient is to the linear functiony=x, the more accurate it is for the predicted value. From Figure4, it can be seen that the corresponding values of the in-store patterns of the 40 hotels have a high"
"response. The closer the linear correlation coefficient is to the linear functiony=x, the more accurate it is for the predicted value. From Figure4, it can be seen that the corresponding values of the in-store patterns of the 40 hotels have a high linear correlation, and all the linear correlation coefficients exceed 0.96. Moreover, the corresponding values of the in-store patterns of these 40 hotels are distributed on both sides of they=xfunction, and the predicted data of the in-store patterns of these 40 hotels are relatively close to they=xfunction. This further illustrates the high feasibility and accuracy of CNN and LSTM algorithms in predicting the in-store patterns of hotel management. Only a few data points deviate from they=xline, but the deviation is within the requirements of hotel management.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the information system of hotel management, the entertainment system is a key part. The prediction accuracy of this part is directly related to the accuracy of CNN and LSTM. This is because the entertainment system varies greatly, and it has a greater relationship with time and the preferences of different people. Predictions for entertainment systems are more complex.

In Figure5, both A and B are representative of the entertainment mode group managed by the hotel. A represents the group of predicted values of entertainment pattern data. B represents the group of actual values of the entertainment mode data. The blue curve represents the predicted value of the entertainment mode, and the red curve represents the actual value of the entertainment mode. In general, the predicted value of hotel management is larger than the actual value of entertainment mode, which is mainly because the predicted value of entertainment mode is in a relatively ideal environment. In general, the corresponding predicted value of the entertainment mode of hotel management has the same distribution as the actual value, and the numerical value is also well maintained. Between intervals 0.6 and 0.75, the predicted values of the hotel management entertainment mode have a good degree of agreement, and most of the corresponding values of the entertainment mode are also distributed in this interval. Only in the interval greater than 0.75 and less than 0.6, the prediction error of the data is large. Overall, CNN and LSTM methods can also better predict the corresponding values of entertainment patterns in hotel management.Open in figure viewerPowerPointCompared with the prediction of entertainment mode, the check-out mode of hotel management is easier to"
"CNN and LSTM methods can also better predict the corresponding values of entertainment patterns in hotel management.Open in figure viewerPowerPointCompared with the prediction of entertainment mode, the check-out mode of hotel management is easier to predict. The check-out model of hotel management has minor changes, and the check-out model of hotel management involves relatively few features. Figure6shows the distribution of the predicted and actual values of the hotel management system's check-out patterns. It can also be easily seen from Figure6that the check-out pattern of hotel management has relatively small fluctuations. CNN and LSTM algorithms also easily predict the corresponding data and characteristics of hotel management check-out patterns. Although the hotel values between 0 and 30 have large fluctuations, the CNN and LSTM methods can also better reflect the peak and trough values of the check-out pattern. The prediction error value for the hotel management check-out mode is completely acceptable to the hotel management. Larger errors mainly appear in the data of hotels in the range of 20 to 25. The CNN and LSTM methods only predict the numerical value of the data well, but it is poor in predicting the fluctuation trend between the data.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFor hotel managers and occupants, sleep patterns are an important system.

Its prediction error is mainly related to the air-conditioning system, curtain control system, and so on. The sleep system has more obvious time characteristics. Figure7reflects the change trend between the predicted value and the actual value of the sleep pattern of hotel management. The red curve represents the predicted data of sleep patterns, and the black part represents the actual data value of the hotel management. The green area is the error area between the two. In general, the data of sleep patterns have relatively large fluctuations, and they also have relatively large fluctuations over time. However, CNN and LSTM algorithms are better at predicting data related to sleep patterns in hotel management. It can also be seen from the green area in Figure7that the prediction error of the sleep mode is also relatively small. It has a relatively obvious cumulative error over time. The larger error mainly exists in the interval 18 to 30, which is also one of the defects of the LSTM algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy of data prediction of this part of the sleep pattern, it is necessary to increase the data sample size of this part of the region.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe prediction errors of entertainment mode and sleep mode are mainly related to the operation of electronic equipment in the guest room.

It is a critical part that the impact system, air conditioning system, and lighting system in the guest room can be adjusted in real time according to the real-time needs of the occupants. To further demonstrate the prediction error of in-room device operation, Figure8shows the prediction error of indoor facilities in entertainment and sleep modes. The squares represent the hotel rooms. This study will illustrate the distribution error of each area of the hotel room in the form of an error heat map. In general, CNN and LSTM have small errors in predicting the operation of indoor equipment, and the prediction error distribution is relatively uniform. Larger prediction errors are mainly distributed in the edge regions of the room. This part of the area may correspond to the video system and air conditioning system. But all the errors meet the requirements of the hotel management information system. This further illustrates that the CNN and LSTM methods can better predict the entertainment and sleep patterns of hotel management.

This prediction error can not only satisfy the requirements of hotel managers, but it can also satisfy the requirements of lodging guests.

ConclusionsThe traditional manual hotel management model can no longer meet the needs of today's people's accommodation. Now, the flow of people in the hotel and the needs of the occupants have a relatively large change and a relatively large amount of information. This requires computer technology to assist hotel managers to manage. More and more hotels have begun to introduce computer information management system, but it can only assist hotel managers to realize the management of in-store mode and out-of-store mode.

In general, CNN and LSTM methods can better predict the four modes of hotel information management system. The largest prediction error is only 2.81%, and this part of the error comes from the prediction of the sleep pattern of the hotel information system.

For the prediction of the entertainment mode and sleep mode of the hotel management system, the prediction error distribution of the operation of indoor equipment is relatively uniform, and most of the errors are distributed within 2%.

The hardware and software system and edge node management platform are implemented first, and then the communication scenarios between the edge layer of the system and the sensing layer, the edge layer, and the cloud layer are analysed, and the business type-driven link selection algorithm and the northbound multilink switching algorithm are designed and implemented, respectively, to guarantee the communication reliability between different layers of the system. Based on the implementation of the above functions, the edge control system can meet the intelligence, expandability, and security requirements of IoT applications. An in-depth investigation and research are launched mainly on the enterprise demand to determine the functional requirements and performance requirements of the enterprise and to achieve the basic logical structure; in the system design phase, the system architecture and other aspects of the design are realized.

"functions are designed in detail. The system is composed of the following modules, namely, personnel change management, organization management, and salary and benefits management. The system consists of the following modules, namely, personnel change management, organization management, compensation and benefits management, and personnel information management. The system modules run through the process of human resource management; in the system implementation stage, the system coding and page operation are realized based on the development tools and software development techniques. The system finally achieves the system design objectives and is put on a trial operation to meet its actual business requirements.1. IntroductionDue to the advent of the information age and the rapid development of economic globalization, the market environment has also shown corresponding changes, and under the influence of this background condition, many enterprises have begun to realize that they should give full play to the value of human resources and turn them into their competitive advantage; however, to achieve this goal, not only must we build a sound human resource management strategy but also must use various techniques [1]. To achieve this goal, it is necessary not only to build a sound human resource management strategy but also to use various technical means to ensure the implementation of the human resources strategy [2]. With the development of computer and network communication"
"this goal, it is necessary not only to build a sound human resource management strategy but also to use various technical means to ensure the implementation of the human resources strategy [2]. With the development of computer and network communication technology, numerous devices are connected to the internet, the boundary between the real world and the virtual world tends to be blurred, and the internet is being extended to the physical world, forming the Internet of Things. In the IoT, the IoT search system is the key for computers to obtain information about the physical world and an important component to build a perfect IoT system [3]. IoT search refers to the use of relevant measures to obtain various information (e.g., objects, people, and web pages) from the IoT, store, and manage this spatial-temporal data information in an organized and orderly manner so that it can be easily searched by users [4]. The maturity of big data and 5G technology has completed the explosive growth of IoT business data, and this data volume is undoubtedly demanding in terms of computing power [5]. The architectural model of cloud computing has been relatively fixed, and even if there is a breakthrough in the hardware performance, it is difficult to complete the task efficiently, and only another efficient computing architecture and computing optimization scheme to assist cloud computing are the solution to cure the symptoms and the root cause [6]. Influenced by the relatively fixed model"
"to complete the task efficiently, and only another efficient computing architecture and computing optimization scheme to assist cloud computing are the solution to cure the symptoms and the root cause [6]. Influenced by the relatively fixed model of cloud computing architecture, the network architecture serving the IoT also lacks some flexibility [7]. The future network should be adaptive to change with the change of business needs and environment, and this kind of intelligence is what is needed for IoT scenarios [8]. By improving the construction of HRM information technology, one can have a positive effect on the integration of management resources and thus reduce the expenditure of management costs. So far, there are numerous pieces of system software for HRM, but these system types are very homogeneous and are used for statistical data, with little interactivity as well as compatibility and more repetitive operations, which waste a lot of system resources [9]. With the emergence of integrated HRMS, management resources can be fully integrated to create favourable conditions for the development of various other tasks [10].Lloret et al. explained that HRM informatization will bring great help to enterprise management, and they suggested that, in addition to storing HR data and payroll accounting, advanced management systems should have functions such as \"labour costing,\" \"data report generation,\" \"monitoring recruitment,\" \"tracking compensation and benefits,\" and"
"and they suggested that, in addition to storing HR data and payroll accounting, advanced management systems should have functions such as \"labour costing,\" \"data report generation,\" \"monitoring recruitment,\" \"tracking compensation and benefits,\" and \"automatic attendance.\" [11] Professor Miao and his colleagues, through the study of the human resource information system, made it possible for the company to develop and implement a new system [12]. Seneviratne et al. analysed the relationship between information technology and competitive strategy, and based on the analysis of the competitive strategy and industrial structure, they discussed the strategic significance of HR information technology, only the successful use of modern information technology can enable companies to gain a competitive advantage and thus undermine their rivals in the competition, truly creating a new field of research on strategic information systems [13]. Pagan et al. studied on the implementation of HR information technology in a large number of enterprises, analysing the main difficulties encountered in the construction of HR information technology, proposing different schemes of process-oriented, model optimization and phased implementation, giving the objectives to be achieved by enterprises in different stages of development of HR information technology, and providing theoretical and example support for the construction of HR information technology in enterprises [14].

"the objectives to be achieved by enterprises in different stages of development of HR information technology, and providing theoretical and example support for the construction of HR information technology in enterprises [14]. Kong et al. believe that the DBSCAN algorithm scans the whole data area, while each point is marked and set as the core object in the cluster, and the boundary objects located at the boundary of the cluster are set as noise, and then the number of objects within a certain distance around each object is determined [15]. The Dyer system is not only able to query static information of IoT entities but also to meet the specific needs of users to query the dynamic content information of physical entities in real time; it abstracts physical entities and sensors as web pages, which facilitates the search of physical entities and achieves seamless integration with traditional search engines [16]. The prediction mechanism is used by the Dyer system [17]. The prediction mechanism used by the Dyer system, while speeding up the efficiency of searching for spatial-temporal data information in the IoT, also reduces the precision of the query, allowing it to be applied in the IoT environment where system resources are more restricted [18]. However, these systems described above are usually single-function IoT search systems, which are not capable of handling multiple types of IoT spatial-temporal data simultaneously [19]. To realize a multifunctional IoT system,"
"are more restricted [18]. However, these systems described above are usually single-function IoT search systems, which are not capable of handling multiple types of IoT spatial-temporal data simultaneously [19]. To realize a multifunctional IoT system, preprocessing and data classification of the collected IoT spatial-temporal data are required [20].With the rapid improvement of the level of science and technology, we have ushered in the era of science and technology. The development and progress of science and technology have not only brought many conveniences to people's daily life but also provided a broader space for the development of enterprises. In the age of technology, increasingly new technologies have been applied to the daily management of enterprises, such as big data, Internet of Things, and other new technologies. The integration of new technologies and human resource management is also an inevitable trend for the future development of enterprises.Therefore, how to make the effective combination of human resources and work efficiency; how to explore the maximum value of human resources; how to meet the needs of employees and, at the same time, achieve the goal of maximizing economic benefits; and how to find a suitable route for enterprise development in a complex market environment and timely response to human resources' problems are the primary issues that enterprises need to solve.

"a suitable route for enterprise development in a complex market environment and timely response to human resources' problems are the primary issues that enterprises need to solve. In the current development of the society, due to the increasingly fierce competition in the market, coupled with the gradual improvement of electronic technology and information systems, under the influence of this background condition, the importance of human resource management is naturally highlighted. The human resource management information system has also been universally recognized by all sectors of society and has been widely used. In the future development of enterprises, the HR management system plays a very important role not only to adapt to the changes in the market environment but also as an important way to promote the reform process. With the system, the efficiency of personnel management is improved, while favourable conditions are created for the development of various tasks. Information security has become a hot topic in recent years, the internet, communications, and other industries are also increasingly concerned about the security of user information, and the data information handled by the human resources' management information system cannot be changed at will; in the future development, strict controls should be adopted to increase the protection of data to avoid theft of data resources by unruly elements and truly protect the personal information of employees.

"information system cannot be changed at will; in the future development, strict controls should be adopted to increase the protection of data to avoid theft of data resources by unruly elements and truly protect the personal information of employees. For enterprises, human resources are not only blood but also very important resources.2. Analysis of Information System Design Based on No Internet of Things2.1. HR IoT DesignIn our increasingly data-centric society, IoT systems have become an important component for generating spatial-temporal data. Various aspects of various fields, from environmental monitoring to smart manufacturing, cannot be separated from the IoT [21]. However, the key to build a complete IoT system is to solve the problem of huge data volume and spatial-temporal data classification of IoT. In the original cloud computing architecture, the user terminal (UE) or sensing terminal (SE) directly uploads the IoT data to the cloud, and the data are fed back from the cloud after the task is successfully executed, and the round-trip time delay of data transmission alone is not negligible [22]. Furthermore, the excessive concentration of data is a huge test for bandwidth, which causes network congestion and jitter and further affects the user experience of IoT applications. The introduction of edge computing architecture into the IoT system can effectively solve this problem. The edge control system model is to introduce the edge cloud part into the original cloud"
"and further affects the user experience of IoT applications. The introduction of edge computing architecture into the IoT system can effectively solve this problem. The edge control system model is to introduce the edge cloud part into the original cloud computing network system, which is composed of edge nodes and is the core of edge computing. The edge cloud is located inside the access network near the user side or understood as between the user layer and the access network. It is because of this spatially distributed deployment feature that the edge control system has lower task processing latency and more customizable system functions. The scenario model diagram of the edge control system introduced in this paper is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointHR IoT framework.The static-priority scheduling algorithm is to give different business processes different priorities, and this priority will not change during the system operation, i.e., the system always executes the business process with higher priority. In the actual environment, the low-priority regular monitoring business occurs more frequently, so the system runs this business process most of the time [23]. High-priority services such as emergency alarms occur less frequently, but once they occur, the system will give up the processing of the other three types of services and give the CPU processing power to the alarm business processes. Preemptive scheduling means that the system strictly"
"alarms occur less frequently, but once they occur, the system will give up the processing of the other three types of services and give the CPU processing power to the alarm business processes. Preemptive scheduling means that the system strictly follows the priority of the business to process business processes. When a high priority arrives, the system prioritizes all current tasks and starts execution from the highest priority task.To get the optimal offloading policy, the input of the algorithm should contain information about the demand for computation and storage resources of all subtasks in the task set. Also, if it is currently the peak period of task generation, then NEN is likely to have no remaining to compute or storage resources. Therefore, when pressing subtask information into the task queue, the subtasks that take longer to execute can be pressed into the task queue first, and these subtasks will also be prioritized when subtasks are offloaded. This strategy ensures that the execution time of the original taskTis reduced as much as possible when there is a peak in task generation. The subtask factors that need to be considered for multiedge node computation collaboration include the expected execution time of subtasks PT, the computational resource requirements of subtasks PC, and the storage resource requirements of subtasks PS. Since the number of CPU cores in NEN is limited and PC is related to PT, PC of subtasks can be set to 1 core and 2 cores according"
"subtasks PT, the computational resource requirements of subtasks PC, and the storage resource requirements of subtasks PS. Since the number of CPU cores in NEN is limited and PC is related to PT, PC of subtasks can be set to 1 core and 2 cores according to the relationship between PT and the average expected execution time age of subtasks in TS.(1)(2)The organization management system is the basic module of the HR system, and the main responsibility is to manage the company's subordinate departments, including information about the organization at all levels, staffing, and management of staff employment, to facilitate HR managers to implement comprehensive management, and to provide statistical charts of all departments' employment and staffing to facilitate the general manager to understand the organization information and to have an in-depth understanding of staff employment to make more scientific decisions. The main functional nodes of organization management are shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointDecision model diagram.According to these two preprocessing steps, subtasks with larger expected execution time will be offloaded first and will be offloaded to the NEN with the smallest required synchronization time, taking into account the balanced relationship between the expected execution time PT of subtasks and the synchronization time dT of subtask files.(3)The algorithm has a good classification for the data transmitted in real time by IoT mainly"
"time, taking into account the balanced relationship between the expected execution time PT of subtasks and the synchronization time dT of subtask files.(3)The algorithm has a good classification for the data transmitted in real time by IoT mainly for cleaning and classifying the transient abnormal data collected by IoT nodes with normal data. And when there is persistent damage to sensor nodes, network disconnection, etc., the algorithm will not be able to achieve the processing of spatial-temporal data. However, in the IoT real-time search system, the system sets up a sensor node and network anomaly monitoring module. When there is an abnormality, the system will get feedback to facilitate the timely maintenance and management of sensor nodes.As the IoT real-time search system, the collected data are continuous, and usually, not much variation is found between adjacent numbers.(4)(5)For the characteristics of the real-time search system of IoT based on spatial-temporal data, the classification network should not only meet the speed that can handle IoT classification but also needs to meet the classification accuracy with good algorithm robustness that can quickly handle abnormal objects and data.(6)The IoT nodes can be controlled quickly and can achieve real-time feedback and operation of the collected data without supervisory interference.

"quickly and can achieve real-time feedback and operation of the collected data without supervisory interference. For example, when the system detects an oil leak, the pump will be automatically shut down; when the system monitors a change in wind speed, the direction of the wind turbine will change; and when the IoT system detects a high concentration of hydrogen sulphide in a dairy farm, it will automatically alarm and promptly notify the person in charge of the safety management of the dairy farm and the relevant safety production management department [24].2.2. Information System DesignThe system construction contains 29 different functional modules, including basic modules and extension modules. There are 17 different modules in the basic module, including organization management, contract management, personnel change management, personnel information management, and salary management. There are 12 different modules in the extension module, including party management, performance management, professional talent management, and decision analysis. In this article, we mainly design the modules of organization management, salary management, personnel change management, and personnel information management in detail, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall system module.The organization management system is the basic module of the HR system, and the main responsibility is to manage the company's subordinate departments, including information about"

The personnel change management module is mainly responsible for managing the change information of staff categories, positions, and duties. Also, it is mainly responsible for separation, redeployment, and conversion, covering the following types of changes: intracompany redeployment, cross-company redeployment, resignation, dismissal, termination, negotiated termination, layoff, retirement, leave, death, and extended retirement. For staff transfer business, it allows two application methods: approval process and direct approval; for staff deployment and staff separation business, it allows four application methods: no approval, direct approval, approval process, and direct record in deployment record/separation record. After all the conversion operations are processed, relevant information will be entered into the personnel information,"
"four application methods: no approval, direct approval, approval process, and direct record in deployment record/separation record. After all the conversion operations are processed, relevant information will be entered into the personnel information, such as the date of conversion and whether to convert. After the implementation of the redeployment process, the relevant information is also entered into the personnel's employment status, such as employment start, personnel category, and redeployment type; it is also possible to directly generate a transfer request form. After the implementation of separation, the same information will also be entered into the separation of personnel, such as the date of separation and the type of personnel after separation; and in the process of separation, because the contract is still valid and there is an employee agreement, they will also be reminded.

"database design mainly includes three stages of work: requirement analysis of the database, design of the logical structure of the database, and design of the physical structure of the database. The invoicing system directly shares data and generates invoice data; at the same time, the statistical table of the Suyuan charging system generates a detailed table of charges, which are directly imported into the financial system to generate corresponding vouchers; through the form settings of the financial system, the generation of the budget execution table is increased, and the comparison table between financial data and budget data for the corresponding period is directly generated to improve the efficiency of financial personnel in tracking and controlling the budget execution.

The spatial-temporal data infrastructure layer provides the operating environment for the normal operation of the spatial-temporal data service layer and spatial-temporal data application layer, including computing facilities, storage facilities, and network facilities. The spatial-temporal data service layer provides various data services for IoT search information systems and industrial application systems, including data exchange and sharing services, data cleansing, integration services, and data analysis and mining services. These data services can also be used by the application layer of the spatial-temporal data in the upper layer. The service gateway provides a unified access point for users outside the spatial-temporal data centre to access various services and applications provided by the spatial-temporal data centre and carries out the necessary authority management.

System Performance ResultsIn the construction of comprehensive departmental information, the departmental file node is the foundation, which can also provide data support for human resource management and can also share data with other related management, helping to reduce its basic input volume. The function of job management is to better maintain the relevant information in the job system and realize the operation of deleting, adding, editing, and modifying job information. In this node, each unit can obtain the corresponding organization chart according to its management scope and its viewing habits. Here, one can freely set the orientation, background colour, connecting lines, fonts, display items, and borders of the organization chart and select the positions or departments to be displayed according to one's needs. In addition to the clear hierarchy of the company, one can also click to check the personnel or positions under the hierarchy and browse the detailed information of the personnel, including their names and photos. One can also print the cards of the employees directly. The work of post management is mainly to build the system of group posts, specifically including the maintenance of post creation and the selection of post successors; also, it should be combined with the actual posting and establishment"
"directly. The work of post management is mainly to build the system of group posts, specifically including the maintenance of post creation and the selection of post successors; also, it should be combined with the actual posting and establishment of personnel, browse the historical posting information and the current posting information, and analyse the posting situation of the post or department, as shown in Figure5. Job information management work is mainly to set the following job-related information: job quality indicators, job basic information, job work authority, and job qualifications, and one can browse, download, and upload job-related attachments here and support the output of job list and job description. Job posting browsing mainly analyses the posting situation, provides the function of browsing the current posting personnel and the former posting personnel, which makes it possible to query the posting history posting information.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointJob information statistics.Personnel information maintenance is used to maintain personnel information, where the personnel information mainly covers personal information, subset information, and job information.

This can apply the ability matching function to view employees and work ability qualities. If the competency management module is enabled, one can apply the ability matching function to view the matching situation and analysis results of employees and positions, as shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointPersonnel information query.Statistical analysis is mainly used for analysis of employees' work information, personal information, and their information, including current employees, transferred employees, terminated employees, and retired employees. Flexible statistical analysis of employee information can be performed, and the results of statistical analysis can be displayed through a variety of graphics. Based on the information of deployment records, the flexible statistical analysis of employee deployment can be realized, and statistical data and various statistical analysis graphs can be provided. The salary system is built based on positions or posts and oriented to the performance, and at the same time, it should consider fairness and efficiency. e-HR system's salary system construction is mainly the information realization of the enterprise salary system, including the establishment of the multi-payroll category scheme, the configuration of the salary rule table, salary item"
"and efficiency. e-HR system's salary system construction is mainly the information realization of the enterprise salary system, including the establishment of the multi-payroll category scheme, the configuration of the salary rule table, salary item setting, salary period, tax rate table, substitute bank configuration, and statistical report. On this interface, one can set various attributes of payroll items, including the rules of taking numbers, whether to include in the payroll system, whether to carry over to the next period, and whether to count tax items. After the items are configured, subordinate units can directly refer to them, as shown in Figure7.Figure 7(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointPayroll statistics.Figure 7(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointPayroll statistics.In this interface, one can set the payroll period and refer to the accounting period so that one can generate the natural monthly payroll period and configure it directly from the actual needs, and in this interface, one can configure the issuance category of the unit's payroll items and directly refer to the public payroll items so that one can realize the personalized configuration of the number taken, and one can import the data used for payroll accounting outside the system.

"accounting outside the system. After the system was successfully tested, the system was applied comprehensively and achieved good results, especially the query engine which can be flexibly set and statistical output, which has changed the way of manual statistics in the past.The realization of organization management module, personnel information management module, employee change management module, and salary management module provides many accurate data supports for scientific decision-making. The system running environment and installation requirements are introduced, and the system's functions are tested by the black-box testing method. The results show that the information system can meet the needs of the company's human resource management.3.2. Analysis of Optimization ResultsWhen planning information technology systems for service companies, not only administrative and financial management systems are involved but also business management systems, which are like those of most companies in other industries. In addition to the company's point of view, we need to consider how to optimize the management of business quality through the information system, how to strengthen the management of personnel scheduling to save costs, how to strengthen the interaction with customers, etc. We also need to consider how to effectively manage the facilities and equipment from the perspective of the project customers to extend the service life and thus realize the value of the property"
"how to strengthen the interaction with customers, etc. We also need to consider how to effectively manage the facilities and equipment from the perspective of the project customers to extend the service life and thus realize the value of the property and how to strengthen the parking management to manage the public revenue of the project customers and ultimately maintain the interests of customers. Because of the above needs, as the manager of the company's business management department held several seminars and after many discussions with information technology professionals and business personnel, the optimization of the information technology system was planned as a whole, from different management perspectives and different business modules, as shown in Figure8.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointAverage processing time.The original OA office system is upgraded. Firstly, the approval process is further sorted out so that the control authority of the company's work is implemented into the system more intuitively and concisely; secondly, the material management is strengthened, and in the process of approval of the material application, the inlet and outlet management of the material is carried out simultaneously, and the use of the material is tracked and managed to avoid unnecessary waste and improve the control ability of cost; thirdly, the original machine attendance is upgraded to the company, and the original machine attendance is upgraded to software attendance,"
"the use of the material is tracked and managed to avoid unnecessary waste and improve the control ability of cost; thirdly, the original machine attendance is upgraded to the company, and the original machine attendance is upgraded to software attendance, which can remotely supervise the attendance of personnel in each project management office through the cell phone positioning function and generate attendance sheets by monthly summary calculation. In addition to the changes, the company is also considering to implement a salary management system, asset management system, and warehouse management system one after another and is actively carrying out demand statistics and market research work. If payroll, asset, and warehouse management can also be integrated into the OA office system, the payroll can directly capture the attendance results to ensure the accuracy of calculation; the depreciation of various assets stored in the warehouse or the warehouse inventory can also become the reference basis for initiating the requisition process, and the company's assets and low-value consumables can be jointly controlled at the front and back ends to avoid waste and save costs, as shown in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointTotal Cost Analysis.The service system includes different functional modules such as an on-site quality verification system, maintenance intelligent scheduling system, facility and equipment inspection and maintenance system, and customer relationship"
"Cost Analysis.The service system includes different functional modules such as an on-site quality verification system, maintenance intelligent scheduling system, facility and equipment inspection and maintenance system, and customer relationship management (CRM) system. Through these different functional modules, we can realize the management and dispatching of service personnel within the project scope, the inspection management and maintenance management of equipment, and the full supervision and management of service process, service speed, and service effect by all management levels of the company, so as to realize the performance management of the organization; through the customer relationship management (CRM) system, we can establish the customer service centre of T company and realize the management through the CRM system; T company's customer service centre can register, assign, track, and give feedback to customers' complaints, suggestions, and repair reports in a \"total-sub-total\" manner, thus achieving the purpose of improving the motivation of employees, improving service quality, enhancing the service level, and saving operation cost; through the overall linkage of each module system in technology, the workload of employees, service quality, service efficiency, and other related data can be tracked. Quantitative statistical forms can be formed to facilitate the data collection of quantitative indicators in the performance assessment of employees; through the"
"of employees, service quality, service efficiency, and other related data can be tracked. Quantitative statistical forms can be formed to facilitate the data collection of quantitative indicators in the performance assessment of employees; through the maintenance intelligent dispatching system, employees can be dispatched statistically and efficiently, and the workload of employees can be counted through dispatching records and statistical forms and directly linked to their salaries, as shown in Figure10.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointManpower cost analysis interface diagram.As the person in charge of the leading department of information technology optimization, information technology professionals are required to negotiate and communicate with information technology system suppliers, and in the process of optimizing the implementation of information technology systems in the above areas, attention has to be paid to the diversity and compatibility of the ports of communication with system suppliers. To ensure data sharing and resource sharing between different functional systems and to meet the import of data forms, the relevant data information should be synchronized with the charging information of the Suyuan management system; the information of the attendance management system should be imported into the salary management system to meet the demand of salary calculation; the information of the customer relationship management (CRM) system should be consistent"
"management system; the information of the attendance management system should be imported into the salary management system to meet the demand of salary calculation; the information of the customer relationship management (CRM) system should be consistent with the information of the maintenance intelligent dispatching system and the follow-up information of task implementation in the site quality verification system. The system should be consistent and eventually form a closed-loop service. Since various information systems are more professional, the promotion speed of each information system must be determined according to the management priority of the company. In order to give full play to the integration of information technology management information, it can be realized by building a data platform and data mining. The integration and sharing of information and resources in each link of the service process can enhance its market competitiveness.4. ConclusionA centralized multitasking scheduling method with a single edge node is proposed to address the problem of how to reduce the processing latency of small tasks in IoT scenarios. The method first designs a multilevel scheduling framework combining process scheduling and thread scheduling, and the process scheduling uses a preemptive static priority scheduling algorithm for different kinds of services.

"thread scheduling, and the process scheduling uses a preemptive static priority scheduling algorithm for different kinds of services. The thread scheduling targets the same kind of business with high concurrency, and this paper proposes a task execution urgency factor and designs a dynamic priority-based thread scheduling algorithm, where the urgency factor is set by the remaining computation within the task deadline. The simulation results show that the proposed multilevel scheduling method is significantly useful in ensuring the time-efficient processing of tasks and can reduce the processing delay of small tasks to a certain extent. The system integrates and optimizes, collaborates, and improves efficiency, optimizes performance management, improves employee motivation, strengthens real-time monitoring and control, provides decision support, avoids operational risks, improves enterprise competitiveness, and provides technical support for the enterprise's HRM strategy. The system is the platform for enterprise human resource management, as well as the management platform for enterprises to achieve strategic improvement and enhance enterprise competitiveness, and is a solid guarantee for enterprises to achieve takeoff.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Project of Zhejiang Province: research on Zhejiang MNE subsidiaries involvement in the"

"AbstractArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science, which includes natural language, intelligent processing, and professional methods. Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the technology and application fields have continued to grow, and the application fields have also continued to expand. This article aims to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in the management information system of container multimodal transportation and to provide convenient and efficient operation methods for container multimodal transportation. This paper proposes the C-means clustering method. Through the research and development of the terminal management system, it has achieved great success in automation, intelligent planning, and integrated management. At the same time, the EDI system is adopted, which mainly uses the combination of GPS and GIS information platform Internet network technology. Therefore, when evaluating the operation of the multimodal transport virtual container under the control of coproduction, the DEA method is used to operate the multimodal virtual container. The situation is analyzed and evaluated, and the multimodal transport virtual container is determined through investment.

"The experimental results of this article show that the artificial intelligence system achieves the most efficient multimodal transport management with the most efficient system model, combined with the leading container multimodal transport virtual enterprise, to provide the best way of the management process for the development of the multimodal transport management information system. The intact rate of container cargo during transportation is as high as 99.7%.1. IntroductionBefore the development of the multimodal transport business, the operators of many transport companies worked independently and created their own systems. Therefore, the work done is very limited. Only after entering the multivehicle business can we expand our business significantly and make more use of our own equipment and materials. Can avoid unnecessary investment in other companies? Due to the development of multiple ships and cross-border transportation facilities, it can be assumed that each supplier can choose the best location and route, establish efficient transportation, improve the level of transportation organization, and coordinate the connection of multiple transmission lines. The carrier will combine multiple modes of transportation to determine the best transportation route and provide a unified transportation document, a unified liability limit, and a unified rate when conditions permit. As a result, cargo owners' demand for more transportation continues to increase, and they are"
"to determine the best transportation route and provide a unified transportation document, a unified liability limit, and a unified rate when conditions permit. As a result, cargo owners' demand for more transportation continues to increase, and they are cooperating with international transportation companies to support the development of multiship transportation. With the development of the global econoour, international trade has become more frequent and larger in scale. In order to reduce trade and transportation costs, a large number of companies have chosen packaging as a carrier. In order to achieve the same small cost, container ship owners are willing to further expand the scale of container ships. This requires that the container terminal corresponding to the large containing ship is also getting bigger and bigger. The voyage needs to be deep and long enough to accommodate large enough ships.With the continuous and in-depth development of network technology and information technology, the importance of network security management is becoming more and more obvious. Among them, network information management and more general security management are important research topics in the field of network security management.

Governments and enterprises in many countries and regions in the world attach great importance to and invest in research in these two directions. Their progress will continue to promote the progress of scientific and technological equipment and, at the same time, will have an impact on the country and national strength and national security. The open large-scale container transportation system is like a large socio-economic system. It is an open system with multiple functions such as transportation, econoour, and labor. In order to perform these functions, the system must absorb a large amount of material, energy, and moisture from other social systems to increase the system capacity and thereby reduce the negative humidity of the system. On the one hand, only in this way, the multimodal container system can not only maintain normal operation but also develop efficiently and systematically. On the other hand, the multimodal transportation system absorbs the resources and energy provided by the society, and on the other hand, it provides added value and supports its further development with its pioneering life cycle.The research on the management information system of container multimodal cooperative transportation based on artificial intelligence technology is a very hot research topic."
"added value and supports its further development with its pioneering life cycle.The research on the management information system of container multimodal cooperative transportation based on artificial intelligence technology is a very hot research topic. Therefore, many well-known scholars at home and abroad have carried out in-depth research on this topic. The article by Li of the container multimodal cooperative transportation management information system based on artificial intelligence technology integrates the resources of various new cooperation modes and proposes an empty container transportation optimization method based on the participation of container ports; that is, the container port is cooperating with other parties. The role of container leasing companies is used to provide shipping companies with empty container demand [1]. Grobelny P mentioned that multimodal transport is still a growth area of Polish economic activity. In 2015, more than 10 million tons of goods were transported in this way, an increase of 7.5% over 2014. According to data from the Railway Transport Office (RTO), Poland's multimodal transport accounts for only 2.37% of the quality of goods transported by rail and 4.53% of the transport work. Compared with other countries, this makes Poland one of the last places in Europe [2].

"work. Compared with other countries, this makes Poland one of the last places in Europe [2]. The latest developments in You J's intelligent transportation system allow traffic safety research to extend from analysis based on historical data to real-time applications. This research proposes a new method for predicting the likelihood of collisions using traffic data collected by discrete loop detectors and web crawling weather data. The matched case-control methods and support vector machine (SVM) technology are used to identify risk status. Adaptive synthetic oversampling technology is applied to solve the problem of unbalanced data sets. Random forest technology is applied to select influencing factors and avoid overfitting problems [3]. Rahman et al.'s technological innovations over the years have highlighted the operation of enterprise connection organizations and different application platforms. Therefore, a unified management information system (MIS) that can use the Web and promote programming development is needed. The software agent is the latest development of computer software technology, which can be used to quickly and easily build integrated information systems [4]. The proposal of Vilkov et al.'s theory and its subsequent solutions are based on fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, and dynamic programming theory.

"its subsequent solutions are based on fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, and dynamic programming theory. Proposed simple enough algorithm to approximate the problem is under consideration, which can be used for software development. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by conceptual examples [5]. Zhao M studies the characteristics of climate anomalies under the complex effects of atmospheric circulation anomalies and monsoon systems. His analysis has followed all the basic characteristics of marine logistics and land logistics, but due to the high transportation risk and long transportation time, freight management is different [6]. Zhu's article draws on the research results at home and abroad, introduces an image processing system, uses mathematical modeling optimization methods, and summary induction methods to establish an image processor-based container multimodal logistics safety emergency decision support system research model. The combination of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis, based on theory, early warning management methods, and emergency decision-making system, made in-depth thinking on the image-based container multimodal transport logistics safety emergency decision support system [7]. There are still many problems encountered in the actual operation process, such as the coordinated deployment of vehicles, the coordination of multiple ports, and the different modes of operation.

"still many problems encountered in the actual operation process, such as the coordinated deployment of vehicles, the coordination of multiple ports, and the different modes of operation. At the time, the transportation of goods will not be the same. These problems need to be resolved. The domestic research and development of the terminal management system started late, but through the unremitting efforts of our developers, we have made great achievements in automation, mechanization, and high efficiency. Chinaâ²s terminal management is also at the worldâ²s top level.The abovementioned scholars have done a very comprehensive research on the logistics safety of container multimodal transport, but they do not have a good combination with artificial intelligence technology. Therefore, this article will focus on the operation form of container multimodal transport under artificial intelligence technology. An inventory of potential safety hazards is made and, at the same time, certain solutions are proposed to the corresponding problems.2. Management Information System of Container Multimodal Coordinated Transportation Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology Method2.1.

"the times, the future technological products brought by artificial intelligence will be the \"box\" of human wisdom. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking [8]. Artificial intelligence is not human understanding, but it can be considered human and beyond human understanding. Artificial intelligence is a very difficult science. People engaged in this business need to understand computer science, psychology, philosophy, artificial intelligence, engineering, and computer vision. It is a very broad science, covering various fields. For example, in general, one of the main areas of artificial intelligence research is to enable machines to perform certain tasks that require continuous understanding by humans. But different times and different people have different understandings of this \"complex task.\" It shows that through personal design and the application of artificial intelligence [9], the port industry has great expectations for artificial intelligence, and it also shows that Chinese ports can use it to increase competition. Large containers are large in size, mass, and bulk and require special space and equipment for operation during the loading and unloading process. Therefore, the central function of the container is called a container terminal. An important part of cargo transportation is transportation. It is a port where water and land transportation usually goes. Its safety, stability, and excellent performance"
"Therefore, the central function of the container is called a container terminal. An important part of cargo transportation is transportation. It is a port where water and land transportation usually goes. Its safety, stability, and excellent performance are the basis for guaranteeing transportation and play a vital role. The modern logistics industry is developing rapidly, and container transportation is the most important tool in international and domestic trade, low cost, large capacity, flexible transmission, etc. These characteristics make it an important part of logistics and transmission [10]. The container industry has become an important indicator to measure a countryâ²s logistics level. The Ministry of Transport plays an important role in the countryâ²s economic development. With the integration of the global financial system and the rapid development of the global financial system, the era of global logistics is coming. The modern container terminal is not a clean container. It has gradually become a large shipping center and the most important distribution logistics center in the system. Its inherent characteristics give it unique advantages in the logistics system. The rapid development of our countryâ²s container terminals has benefited from many factors at home and abroad: domestic economic development, economic transformation, global economic system, international trade growth, advanced machine automation, modern control systems, and international competition"
"terminals has benefited from many factors at home and abroad: domestic economic development, economic transformation, global economic system, international trade growth, advanced machine automation, modern control systems, and international competition [11]. Under the influence of these various factors, the development of container terminals will inevitably develop more efficiently and effectively. The home computer software industry started late, and the research and development of terminal management information systems regressed. Computer intelligence and information management systems are widely used in developed countries, widely used in many industries, and have achieved amazing results in the adoption of modern management systems. Foreign countries have achieved great success in automation, intelligent planning, and integrated management through the research and development of terminal management systems. Information technology is the foundation of understanding. Different conditions can be met. Subsequent business requirements and operational requirements can be implemented objectively and efficiently, delivered on a regular basis, and formulate optimal operating strategies, improve terminal operating efficiency, and save customers time and cost power. The most important function of the terminal control system is automation. Automation is an important production problem through integrated management process, system analysis process, and information process [12,13]."
"save customers time and cost power. The most important function of the terminal control system is automation. Automation is an important production problem through integrated management process, system analysis process, and information process [12,13]. Automatic drilling can greatly improve container loading and unloading operations, reduce the intensity of simulation work, and reduce the spread of business risks. This is a successful automation application. Knowledge integration refers to the high degree of dispersion of multiple knowledge and the global optimization of resources.2.2. Container Multimodal Cooperative Transportation Management Information SystemContainer transportation is a product of transportation renewal and an important part of logistics renewal. Especially, in recent years, multiship transportation has become a transportation organization for international logistics services, and its services and benefits will be reflected and embodied in the industry. Although multilane traffic has been developed for ten years, there are still many problems that are difficult to coordinate [14]. There are many contents and problems in multiapplication transmission systems not only \"application\" problems but also \"software\" problems. For the application itself, the problem is mainly focused on the promotion and use of the application, and the software problem is the optimization of the system and the level of use of the application.

"problems. For the application itself, the problem is mainly focused on the promotion and use of the application, and the software problem is the optimization of the system and the level of use of the application. For this reason, it is necessary to work from the perspective of system integration, so that the system can work more efficiently. Advantages of container multimodal transport is as follows: regardless of the number of transport conditions used to transport goods and the frequency of changes in the goods during transportation, all transport cases are handled by multicarrier operators [15].The multimodal transport operator is the organizer of the entire transportation. In the multimodal transport, its business procedures mainly include the following links:(1)Accept consignment applications and conclude multimodal transport contracts(2)Issuance, pickup, and delivery of containers(3)Export declaration(4)Packing of goods and receiving goods(5)Booking space and arranging cargo delivery(6)Apply for insurance(7)Issuing a multimodal transport bill of lading to organize and complete the entire transportation of goods(8)Customs business during transportation(9)Delivery of goods(10)Handling of freight accidentsAmong them, the business has better requirements for the overall system design mainly in 1, 4, 6, and 3.

"business has better requirements for the overall system design mainly in 1, 4, 6, and 3. It is explained as follows:(1)The multimodal transport operator judges whether to accept the consignment application based on the consignment application submitted by the consignor and its own transportation route. If it can be accepted, after the two parties have agreed on the relevant matters, they will sign the copy of the station receipt to the shipper or its agent to prove that the application for consignment is accepted, and the multimodal transport contract has been concluded and started to be implemented.(4)For the full container of goods packed by the owner, the consignor shall be responsible for transporting the goods to the place specified in the agreement between the two parties, and the multimodal transport operator or his agent shall receive the goods at the designated place. In the case of LCL cargo, the operator receives the cargo at the designated freight station. After receiving the goods, the person receiving the goods on behalf of the intermodal transport operator shall sign the original receipt at the station and give it to the consignor or its agent.(6)On the shipperâ²s side, cargo transportation insurance should be insured. The insurance is handled by the consignor itself, or the consignor shall bear the expenses and be handled by the multimodal transport operator on his behalf. Cargo transportation insurance can be insured for the entire journey or in sections. In"
"insured. The insurance is handled by the consignor itself, or the consignor shall bear the expenses and be handled by the multimodal transport operator on his behalf. Cargo transportation insurance can be insured for the entire journey or in sections. In the case of multimodal transport operators, cargo liability insurance and container insurance shall be insured, and the operators or their agents shall apply to the insurance company or in other forms.The courier only needs to bring a transfer contract and a safe. If the baggage is lost or damaged during transportation, the multivehicle operator will be responsible for all transportation, and the transfer of each transportation component will be responsible for the damage of its own transportation part. Most ships use containers as a means of transportation to directly complete the transshipment. After the goods are stored in the manufacturer's office or shop, they can be directly shipped to the shop owner's office or shop. Due to the use of fitness equipment for loading and unloading during transporting, and the luggage in the box is not affected, luggage damage, luggage accidents, and luggage theft are greatly reduced, thereby improving the quality of luggage to a certain extent. In addition, due to the close cooperation and close connection of multiple transportation systems in many aspects, the speed and transit time where the goods go reduce the loading time of many goods, thereby ensuring the safety, speed, and"
"certain extent. In addition, due to the close cooperation and close connection of multiple transportation systems in many aspects, the speed and transit time where the goods go reduce the loading time of many goods, thereby ensuring the safety, speed, and accuracy of the goods [16]. Multimodal transportation can improve the level of transportation organization, realize integration and integration, and improve the connectivity between different transportation systems. Before the development of multimodal transport, operators of many shipping sites worked independently and made their own plans. Therefore, the length of business is limited, and the scale of freight is also limited. However, once different transportation companies join multivehicles, it can greatly increase the scale of service operations, increase the impact of available equipment, and choose better transportation routes and arrange appropriate transportation. With the development of the global econoour, international trade has become more frequent and larger in scale. In order to reduce trade and transportation costs, a large number of companies have chosen packaging as a carrier. In order to achieve the same small cost, container ship owners are willing to further expand the scale of container ships. This requires container terminals corresponding to large container ships to become larger and larger [17,18]. Cruise ships need to have deep and long enough scenes to transport large container ships. The opening"
"expand the scale of container ships. This requires container terminals corresponding to large container ships to become larger and larger [17,18]. Cruise ships need to have deep and long enough scenes to transport large container ships. The opening of the container handling system also proved internally that this operation requires a large amount of information exchange. Compared with sea transportation, a large amount of information exchange is also required for the terminal or transportation to accurately obtain its precise positioning to ensure the efficiency of transportation. The plan is to exchange information with the two main departments as follows: the first is production, planning, operation, transportation, and related procedures, rules and regulations, etc. The second is the distribution and demand of related commodities, national and regional policy information, policy information, product information, policy and regulation information, special technical information, etc. The information exchanged between programs and regions, for example, should provide multivehicle transportation systems with transshipment capabilities to the environment [19] and collect information such as time changes and transportation information through supply and demand updates to ensure the normal operation of the multibox transshipment system. The artificial intelligence industry started late, and the development of terminal management information systems is relatively slow. Computer"

Algorithm of the Management Information System of Container Multimodal Coordinated Transportation Based on Artificial Intelligence TechnologyOn the basis of explicit C partition, the C-means clustering method cannot be obtained [21]. The C-method shown in the set method reduces the category variation to an area function [22], and the mathematical model is defined as follows:(1)wherevrepresents speed and S represents mileage(2)The result of cluster analysis of items using the C-mean clustering method is that one item belongs to one category. In cluster analysis, when the impact factors required for planning and their degree of impact have been fully determined [23], The algorithm can also be used in the calculation of the container scheduling problem of the terminal, which can effectively improve the scheduling efficiency. The C-means cluster analysis method can be used, as shown in the following formula:(3)(4)If several cluster center vectors are known, the Euclidean distance betweenxand the cluster center vectorvis as follows:(5)(6)Based on the C-split fuzzy division, the C-split fuzzy method can be obtained.

The C-method simulation function is also a cluster analysis method, which can reduce the category variability as a quality function [24]. An example of the C-means compression function is as follows:(7)(8)Through the above formula, it can be concluded that the fuzzy C-type mean clustering method can be expressed as the following mathematical program:(9)(10)(11)Due to the factors that affect the design and construction of container components, there is a certain degree of uncertainty and attention in the information and description collection process [25], so the average clustering method is selected to read the configuration of container componentsvandx.(12)(13)The purpose of studying transportation output is to determine their impact on total output and total input. Among them, the structural effect refers to the impact of other factors, especially changes in the input system, on the total output. When the total amount remains the same or the production system remains unchanged, the total output remains unchanged. Through the total investment I, on the premise that there is a proportional growth relationship P between input and output, the above definition is expressed by a mathematical model:(14)(15)To use the calculation of structural effects to guide the structural adjustment of a multitool system, we"
"that there is a proportional growth relationship P between input and output, the above definition is expressed by a mathematical model:(14)(15)To use the calculation of structural effects to guide the structural adjustment of a multitool system, we must first identify which institutional effects are signs of structural optimization. The concept of optimization is to use many transmission conditions and find the optimal areaq. The actual use range of parameterpis (0.08-3.97), the range ofVis (36.7-42.9), and the range ofSis (697-1182).(16)(17)Theoretically speaking,khas a maximum value, andpthat satisfies the maximum value ofkis the optimal probability value of multimodal transport distribution. The following formula can be derived:(18)(19)(20)3. Experiments on the Management Information System of Container Multimodal Coordinated Transportation Based on Artificial Intelligence TechnologyWhile global trade has enabled the continuous development of the global econoour, it has also enhanced the competitiveness of container terminals in the global econoour. The scale of the entire container trade industry has dropped by 37.6%, shipping has decreased by 60%, and the utilization rate of terminals around the world has also shown a cliff-like decline. Even in the face of the global economic crisis, the economic crisis of container trade has become more serious.

"cliff-like decline. Even in the face of the global economic crisis, the economic crisis of container trade has become more serious. In recent years, the development of our countryâ²s container terminal culture has slowed down, which has already touched the bottleneck of industrial development. Faced with this situation, the country has issued corresponding policies to deal with it. Under the new policy format and new policies, the terminal industry is facing a world and challenging situation. On the one hand, some of the best companies can stand out from the competition, continuously improve facilities and management, and promote healthy growth; on the other hand, competition forces companies to continuously improve, increase productivity and performance levels, improve management systems, reduce operating costs, and improve enterprises the ability to avoid risks. For a combination of multiple transmission capabilities, a single mating cable is not enough. The importance of the matching base lies in the self-regulation of the transmission capacity among many transmission systems. However, the econoour is constantly developing and developing, and the demand for transportation is also growing, then adapting to the oral system. For multimode payload requirements, the corresponding process is also static. The development process is to make up for this defect and is also an important basis for the balance of power and energy [26].3.1. Experimental Description and Experimental"
"For multimode payload requirements, the corresponding process is also static. The development process is to make up for this defect and is also an important basis for the balance of power and energy [26].3.1. Experimental Description and Experimental StrategyThanks to the precise control function of the container control system, the terminal runs smoothly. With the continuous change of business, the function of the terminal control system also needs to change constantly, and the control system also needs corresponding changes, which puts forward the highest requirements for the function of the system. However, the system has always focused on a common location in the design process and is unlikely to be useful when dealing with new situations that affect terminal performance. In this case, the developer needs to consider whether the project manager has the ability to adapt to changes during the development process. Before developing an information system, it is necessary to analyze the information processing function, construct system architecture, levels, functional modules, and related processes. This problem needs to be subdivided from surface to space, from process to perspective, from top to bottom, etc., in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. System performance requirements are analyzed through system analysis. First, the research objectives and the performance requirements are determined through objective research objectives.

First, the research objectives and the performance requirements are determined through objective research objectives. The research subjects have a wide range of requirements, strong professionalism, and rich experience. It should include managers, professionals, engineers and technicians, customer personnel, and other personnel who design program information. Second, what is being studied is determined, including people, things, and the relationship between the two. The functional requirements of the program can be understood through human research, the functional basis of the program can be understood through the study of the object, and the functional relevance of the program can be determined by the relationship between people and objects and between people. Then, there is the research method, and the most accurate research method is used through the process of the most extensive procedural activities, levels, and relevance. The final step is to wisely choose the size of the work through their expertise, remove the excess size, and determine the length of the subject work required to determine the key size.

"system performance analysis can ensure that a well-designed system is optimized, managed, and fully functional.3.2. Sample CollectionThe container terminal management system is not a simple data management system. Through this system, the intelligent transmission function of the junction box can also be realized. It is a highly automated and intelligent system that can improve machine efficiency and reduce unnecessary workload. The intensity of simulation work is reduced, the production process is shortened, work efficiency is improved, and continuous performance is achieved under certain requirements. While improving performance, it also saves time and cost for customers. The types of these materials are not uniform for containers that run multiple fitness applications, and the technical indicators and operating parameters may be completely inconsistent. The parameter indicators in similar applications may be incompatible, which makes many information processes in information sharing. And this knowledge is effective. This is the problem of \"knowledge islands.\" And with the development of the terminal, not all facilities should be added and constantly updated, which means that \"information islands\" will continue to form, which will significantly affect the digital structure of terminal containers. The lack of full automation of business operations and terminal services and no knowledge can reveal the benefits of the program.3.3. Experimental Results and Data AnalysisThe"

The lack of full automation of business operations and terminal services and no knowledge can reveal the benefits of the program.3.3. Experimental Results and Data AnalysisThe automation and understanding of traditional terminals is a new trend. Unlike fully automated terminals, the automatic conversion of traditional container terminals must plan for existing investments to avoid affecting business growth. Finding a low-cost method can also identify exercises on this basis. This is a challenge that every traditional container terminal must face now.

The impact of seizure on the flow of goods is analyzed by simple cargo flow patterns in container transportation and cargo organization. The migration of related goods depends on the transportation regulations of many countries and the economic and local conditions of each transportation system to determine diversification and distribution methods and distribution systems.

The growth change of \"spontaneous growth\" explained by the expansion of the transfer rate has also changed the system; on the other hand, because the first transfer method cannot adapt to the development needs of the new period and new situation, the transfer rate transfers between different systems, that is, competition and substitute.

In order to compete in the container shipping market, shipping companies operating in the container market face potential market competition and continue to combine, configure, and adjust to purchase large container ships. Large container ships use economies of scale to improve service quality, reduce costs, and increase competition.
