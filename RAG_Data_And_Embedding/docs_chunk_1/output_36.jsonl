"AbstractAeronautical Meteorological Offices under National Meteorological and Hydrological Service provide critical meteorological, hydrological, ocean and climatological information that sustain air navigation safety, efficiency, and regularity. Thus, to quality assure the information, the International Civil Aviation Organization recommended in 2002 that Aeronautical Meteorological Offices should implement ISO 9001 quality management system, which was subsequently standardized and became effective on 15 November 2012. There has been a slow movement towards adoption due to a number of barriers. In July 2019, 52% of Aeronautical Meteorological Offices commenced transition to the fifth iteration, ISO 9001:2015. A range of studies have investigated the barriers to successful quality management system implementation and certification within various organizations. However, only one study examined the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices and none of them covered the Anglophone Caribbean. Hence, the demography of the sample for this study is unique and this paper will contribute to filling the gaps in the literature. This exploratory study aims to identify the barriers, investigate their impacts, and propose recommendations to assist the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices to fully implement the ISO standard.

"the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices to fully implement the ISO standard. Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service was selected as a case study due to its progress in the quality management system implementation and the scope of its operations. The study used and triangulated data collected from secondary sources (desktop research) and primary sources (survey and interviews). Seventeen barriers were identified and formed the new empirical framework for the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices in the Anglophone Caribbean. Most barriers were in the category of resources. The findings have significant implications for the policymakers, especially executive management, to address the barriers that are risks to sustainable quality management system.1 INTRODUCTIONDevelopment of meteorology, climatology, ocean and hydrology related data and forecasts must be undertaken on a global scale and standards. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has embraced this mandate and worked assiduously to maintain the framework for international cooperation (WMO,2019). The provision of timely and accurate meteorological forecasts for aviation services depends on interrelated, interdependent components of a complex system that includes collection of observations and historical data, numerical weather modelling results, formulating forecast products, understanding consequences and impacts, and communicating with the users (Fakhruddin et al.,2019; International Civil Aviation Organization"
"collection of observations and historical data, numerical weather modelling results, formulating forecast products, understanding consequences and impacts, and communicating with the users (Fakhruddin et al.,2019; International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO],2010a,2010b,2016). Aeronautical Meteorological Offices (AMOs) have a distinct responsibility to provide these observations 24 h per day in real time. These data are critical to supporting WMO's World Weather Watch, which consists of national, regional, and global weather and climate prediction centres (WMO,2006,2015,2017b). It is evident that the complementary relationship between safety and quality of data and forecast must be embedded in the operation of this complex system with high quality to ensure effective forecasting and warning system development.The Quality Management Framework for National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NHMS) was addressed by the WMO guidelines (WMO,2011,2014,2017b,2017c). This framework was instrumental in providing timely and pertinent guidance to AMOs to assist them in developing quality management system (QMS) (WMO,2011,2014). Through collaborative efforts between WMO and the International Organization of Standardization (ISO), development of joint standards relating to quality management was ratified (WMO,2014,2017b).

"(ISO), development of joint standards relating to quality management was ratified (WMO,2014,2017b). ISO is an independent, non-governmental organization that comprises members from the national standards bodies of 164 countries to ensure that products and services are safe, reliable, and of good quality (ISO,2015a,2019). The evolution of QMS in Aeronautical Meteorology is summarized in Figure1.FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe evolution of quality management in aeronautical meteorology. ICAO, International Civil Aviation Organization; WMO, World Meteorological OrganizationDaily operation of the AMOs is conducted in a highly standardized environment, and quality is an inherent attribute. Therefore, to quality assure the information, the ICAO and WMO required the AMOs to comply with the ISO 9001 QMS and to be certified by an approved organization (ICAO,2010a,2016; WMO,2017a,2018). Therefore, the AMOs need to transition to the current standard of ISO 9001:2015. Implementing ISO 9001:2015 standard is critical for quality assurance, continuous improvement, and maintaining competitive advantage. This standard directly relates to the level of service provided by forecasters and the need for quality assurance, data integrity, and continuous improvement. Noncompliance in the implementation of ISO 9001:2015 QMS standard, which provides quality assurance of the process and procedures that produce the data and information needed by airlines; jeopardizes the ability of the AMOs"
"and continuous improvement. Noncompliance in the implementation of ISO 9001:2015 QMS standard, which provides quality assurance of the process and procedures that produce the data and information needed by airlines; jeopardizes the ability of the AMOs to provide trusted information and can ultimately affect the future operations of AMOs if international airlines resort to alternative weather providers. The negative ramifications will indubitably affect cash inflows of airports and, by extension, tourism and economic sustainability.Extensive studies across countries and cultures have been undertaken to understand the barriers in implementing QMS standards. Only a few studies focused on the impacts of these impediments. One study examined the AMOs and none of them covered the Anglophone Caribbean. A greater understanding of the barriers specific to the AMOs in the Anglophone Caribbean is needed to properly evaluate the status of the AMOs and offer solutions. Thus, this study aims to identify the barriers to ISO implementation within the AMOs of the Anglophone Caribbean states that are members of the Caribbean Meteorological Organization (CMO). The lessons learned from the case study could assist other meteorology offices to set up benchmark and successful implementation of QMS.2 LITERATURE REVIEW2.1 Barriers to implementation of ISO 9001 QMSOxford Dictionary (2019) defines a barrier as 'a circumstance or obstacle that keeps people or things apart or prevents communication or"
"set up benchmark and successful implementation of QMS.2 LITERATURE REVIEW2.1 Barriers to implementation of ISO 9001 QMSOxford Dictionary (2019) defines a barrier as 'a circumstance or obstacle that keeps people or things apart or prevents communication or progress'. On 15 November 2012, the implementation of an ISO 9001 QMS for AMOs was standardized by ICAO and WMO. The AMOs of the Anglophone Caribbean have faced many barriers during the implementation process of the 2015 version. The existence of these hindrances is not unique to the AMOs in this region. A range of literature corroborates that many organizations across the globe face challenges with the QMS implementation (Amar & Zain,2002; Lopes et al.,2022; Solomon et al.,2017; Sroufe & Curkovic,2008). Related to this, Chin et al. (2000), and Withers and Ebrahimpour (2001) inferred that the barriers can hinder and lengthen the implementation, delay the QMS accreditation, and induce a loss of motivation from the staff in both private and public sector. Various factors affect the implementation of the ISO 9001 QMS for either 1994, 2000, or 2008 versions (Abdullah et al.,2013; Al-Asiri,2004; Amar & Zain,2002; Magd,2008; Sharif,2005; Yahya & Goh,2001; Zeng et al.,2007).

"Prajogo and Sohal (2006) noted that the extremity of each barrier differs from one version to the next.ISO 9001:2015 standard comprises 10 core sections or clauses, an understanding of which is imperative for proper documentation and successful QMS implementation and certification (ISO,2015a,2015b; WMO,2017b) (Figure2). Each section comprises multiple sub-clauses, which provide further guidance on how to apply the standards (ISO,2015b; WMO,2017b).FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointISO 9000:2015 PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle.

"ISO, International Organization of Standardization.2.2 Identification of barriersSharif (2005) and Abdullah et al. (2013) classified the barriers under four headings. The sub-categorization is similar to the approach by Fuentes et al. (2000), who alternatively used the categories of (1) organizational barriers, (2) technical barriers, (3) vertical barriers, which pertain to the economic chain, for instance, the customer and/or supplier relationship, and (4) economic barriers, which comprise external variables including the availability of qualified advisers, training, and economic support programmers (Abdullah et al.,2013).The recurring obstacles include lack of management commitment, poor leadership, lack of human resources, lack of training, lack of understanding of ISO standards, financial constraints, resistance to change, and negative culture or attitude towards quality. In addition, the barriers were identified in four of the eight studies (Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abdullah et al. (2013), Abu-Khadra et al. (2012)). Lack of commitment from the executive management is perceived as the most important in three of them, except for Abdullah et al. (2013), who determined that the most significant impediment is the lack of cooperation among internal departments.

The most prevalent barrier was executive management commitment, followed by the lack of cooperation and involvement by the employees.2.3.1 Resource barriersThe two resource barriers that were most prevalent in the organizations were the unavailability of human resources and the lack of quality training and education.2.3.1.1Insufficient human resourcesISO 9000:2015 Clause 7.1.2 highlights the need for the organization to provide the persons who will play a pivotal role in ensuring the QMS functions optimally (ISO,2015a).

"role in ensuring the QMS functions optimally (ISO,2015a). Human resources needed include staff for control of documents, control of records monitoring, measuring and auditing, and maintaining infrastructure. Many studies have indicated that this challenge negatively impacts some critical processes and procedures within organizations (Abdullah et al.,2013; Abu-Khadra et al.,2012; Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011; Amar & Zain,2002; Magd,2008; Sharif,2005). It was the most difficult hurdle that the Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors overcame. Amar and Zain (2002) opined that the unavailability of human resources results from a weak commitment from management. Sharif (2005) revealed that the Libyan Manufacturing Public Sector Organizations (LMPSOs) suffered from limited consultation with certification bodies. Similarly, Zeng et al. (2001) highlighted that some certified companies in China face problems with the lack of dependability of auditors resulting in ineffective audits and reviews. Contrastingly, Yuzyk et al. (2016) admitted that the success of the QMS and effective auditing within the NMHS of Canada stems from the dedicated and engaging leadership who understand the importance of human resource and, as a result, strategies are used to select and train competent auditors to address the demands of the QMS.2.3.1.2Lack of education and quality trainingEducation and quality training is crucial to maintain a competent workforce and to ensure that the team understands their specific"
"used to select and train competent auditors to address the demands of the QMS.2.3.1.2Lack of education and quality trainingEducation and quality training is crucial to maintain a competent workforce and to ensure that the team understands their specific roles and responsibilities (Moeeni et al.,2022; WMO,2017b). Continuous quality training is necessary for the effective execution of the requirements of ISO 9001 (Borra et al.,2022). Solomon et al. (2017) noted that the lack of quality training breeds a negative culture within the organization, which in turn stagnates the QMS. Several of the authors, Sharif (2005), Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abu-Khadra et al. (2012), noted that without the commitment of top management, the prospects for continuous training will be dismal.2.3.2 Organizational barriers2.3.2.1Lack of top management commitmentClause 5 in ISO 9000:2015 emphasizes the importance of top management commitment and promulgates that the effectiveness of the QMS is reliant on this level of commitment (ISO,2015a). Similarly, Psomas et al. (2010) proffered that the delegation of responsibilities and establishing a rewards system that will motivate employees and promote a quality culture also hinges on leadership. Amar and Zain (2002), Al-Asiri (2004), Zeng et al. (2007), Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abu-Khadra et al. (2012), Solomon et al. (2017) and Bounabri et al.

"leadership. Amar and Zain (2002), Al-Asiri (2004), Zeng et al. (2007), Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abu-Khadra et al. (2012), Solomon et al. (2017) and Bounabri et al. (2017) pinpointed that this barrier had the most significant impact on the organizations. Further, Magd (2008) stated that without such dedication from management, the tendency of employees is to attach low priority to QMS, which in turn can render the system static. Sharif (2005) indicated that the autocratic style of leadership that dominates the LMPSOs contributes to the collapse in communication and the non-existence of a rewards system.The study revealed that late management reviews, reduced financial support, and lack of training are symptoms of a lack of commitment from the leadership. Environment Canada only encountered some initial challenges with finances. Yuzyk et al. (2016) emphasized the importance of top management commitment and organizational quality culture. There is a positive correlation between leadership and the success of QMS, which could apply to any service including early warning.2.3.2.2Lack of employee cooperation and involvementA QMS consists of several interrelated and interdependent processes and procedures, thus employee involvement and capacity building are crucial to its sustainability (Lamjahdi et al.,2020; WMO,2017a).

"thus employee involvement and capacity building are crucial to its sustainability (Lamjahdi et al.,2020; WMO,2017a). In the Malaysian local government organizations, this barrier was most impactful. Abdullah et al. (2013) indicated that local government organizational structure consists of sub-departments with specific roles and responsibilities. The authors noted that while this facilitates diversification, it negatively impacts the internal relations that are vital for the sustainability of QMS. Chu et al. (2001) stated that one of the prerequisites for the maintenance and efficiency of ISO 9001 QMS is the establishment of consistent internal cooperation and strong organizational structure.2.3.3 Technical barriers2.3.3.1Lack of understanding of ISO requirements and lack of documentationThe ISO 9001:2015 QMS requires four stages of documentation, hence understanding the standards is critical. Moreover, technical difficulties arising from the ISO revisions require a thorough knowledge of the ISO QMS. However, lack of budgetary allocation to facilitate training is a common barrier impeding upgrading the documentation process. Sharif (2005), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abdullah et al. (2013), and Solomon et al. (2017) noted the presence of these barriers in their studies.

"the presence of these barriers in their studies. Sharif (2005) pinpointed that executive and middle management did not prioritize training and that the centralized leadership system resulted in a higher level of ignorance.The study performed a factor analysis and discovered that apart from top management commitment, the Indonesian Manufacturing Organizations, LMPSOs, Egyptian Manufacturing Organizations, Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors, and Jordanian Private Mobile Companies faced a spate of other common challenges, which were lack of human resources, lack of education and quality training, lack of employee involvement and cooperation, and lack of organizational culture. In the Malaysian local government organizations and the Meteorological Service of Canada, this barrier was non-existent. Regarding Malaysia's local government, Abdullah et al. (2013) indicated that the government institutes mandatory regulations. Yuzyk, Thomson, and Cantin (2016) explained that the leadership recognized the importance of its accountabilities to the success of the QMS (Murmura & Bravi,2017).2.3.4 Cultural barriers2.3.4.1Lack of organizational culture and resistance to changeSolomon et al. (2017) emphasized that culture is a non-tangible element that affects both the corporate culture and the performance of the company.

"element that affects both the corporate culture and the performance of the company. They further added that the organization's quality policy must be spearheaded by management. Within this context, Juran and Defeo (2010) added that a 'workforce who is segmented into individuals or groups who embody conflicting beliefs and values, does not hold together'. WMO (2017b) explained that top management must create and maintain quality culture. Most of the authors except Yuzyk, Thomson, and Cantin (2016) documented the existence of a breakdown in organizational quality culture, which was reflected in the attitude of the employees towards culture (Abdullah et al.,2013; Abu-Khadra et al.,2012; Al-Asiri,2004; Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011; Amar & Zain,2002; Magd,2008; Sharif,2005; Solomon et al.,2017; Zeng et al.,2007). Sharif (2005) documented that the autocratic leadership style creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, thus damaging the organizational culture. Similarly, Bounabri et al. (2017) highlighted that the dominance of bureaucracy erodes the organizational fabric and contributes to a reluctance to change.2.4 Knowledge gapThere is a lack of research studies investigating the barriers to ISO 9001:2015.

The quantitative methodology was employed to identify the barriers to QMS implementation, while the qualitative method facilitated deeper insights into the impacts of the barriers and strategic interventions. The conceptual framework for the barriers is shown in Figure3.FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointConceptual framework of barriers to ISO 9001: quality management system (QMS)3.1 SamplingPurposive sampling was used due to the nature of this study. This method is applicable when elements of the population may be difficult to reach or when a specific sample is needed for given research (Bernard,2000; Neuman Lawrence,2014). It is unique to the AMOs of the Anglophone Caribbean and exploring the barriers to QMS within those bounds.The typical case sampling approach for the case study was utilized.

The cumulative impact of the case study and the sample of managers/quality managers of selected AMOs further expanded the study so that the understanding gained could succinctly contribute to the development of strategies for the successful implementation of ISO 9001 QMS.The research population consists of 16 AMOs, which are in the countries of Anguilla, Antigua, and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, and its Dependencies, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad, and Tobago and the Turks and Caicos Islands.Due to the size of the target population, all members of the population were considered as respondents to identify the barriers. At least two participants were chosen, consisting of (1) the manager and (2) quality manager/senior forecaster or senior staff member from each of 16 AMOs because these persons are experts in the field and have a strategic view of the service and the barriers. All AMOs with the exception of Turks and Caicos participated, and 29 respondents completed the questionnaire with a usability rate of 100%.The Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service (TTMS) was selected as a case study due to its progress in QMS implementation and the scope of its operations.

The main Meteorological and Forecast Office is located at the South Terminal Building at Piarco Airport, an Upper Air Station located opposite to Air Guard station, a Climatological and Technical Division at the same location at the Upper Air Station and a Meteorological Observing Station at Crown Point Airport, Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago is also a member of the WMO. In addition, it has a Flight Information Region (FIR) of 750,000 square miles, which is an area of controlled airspace. It bears the responsibility of providing flight information and alerting service for that FIR (ICAO,2016,2018). TTMS is also a Meteorological Watch Office and is in charge of the provision of information within the confines of the FIR, on the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified en-route weather and other phenomena in the atmosphere that may affect the safety of aircraft operations including significant adverse weather (SIGMET) and information that pertain to the safety of aircraft operations at all levels.

Semi-structured interviews were held with the Climatologist, Ag Quality Manager, QMS personnel from the AMOs. In addition, an interview was conducted with the Science and Technology Officer of CMO.3.2 Data collection3.2.1 Online surveyTo prepare the survey questionnaire, conceptual frame elements (Al-Asiri,2004; Amar & Zain,2002; Bernard,2000) were used to ensure that the four categories of barriers related to implementing ISO 9001 QMS were included. These questions were developed to derive the pertinent data from resolving the research questions and achieving the core objectives of this study (Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011; Magd,2008).A themed approach was used for the questionnaire to foster more straightforward evaluation and analysis (Wilkinson & Birmingham,2003), comprised of four sections. Section1was dedicated to demographic information. Section2addressed QMS implementation.

The interview guide explored the impacts of the four categories of barriers: resource, organizational, cultural, and technical. A thematic approach was maintained to increase the efficiency of the data collection process and subsequent data analysis. The survey preceded the semi-structured interviews. Therefore, most introductory questions were not repeated to avoid duplication. The three interview guides were developed to facilitate the interviews for the case study at Trinidad and Tobago AMO, selected AMOs, and the caribbean Meteorological Organ (CMO). The researchers piloted the survey and interview with few persons to correct ambiguities. The researchers spent one workday at Trinidad and Tobago AMO, which fostered observation of operations and face-to-face interviews with the Senior Climatologist and the Quality Manager. The interviews with the Grenada AMO Manager and the Science and Technology Officer of CMO were 45 min and 1.5 h, respectively.

"interviews with the Grenada AMO Manager and the Science and Technology Officer of CMO were 45 min and 1.5 h, respectively. The interview with the Manager of Grenada AMO was conducted using video telephony, while a face-to-face interview was conducted with CMO. The interviews were completed within 2 months.3.3 Data analysis3.3.1 Quantitative data analysisThe data analysis included survey data and descriptive statistics. Notifications of the responses to the questionnaires were received through SurveyMonkey®, and the data were extracted with the platform tools and incorporated into the research. The descriptive design was selected because it assisted in identifying and ranking the measured variables within each construct and described the distribution of each variable (Bernard,2000; Neuman Lawrence,2014). The simple descriptive statistics included percentages and frequencies.3.3.2 Qualitative data analysisData analysis for this study combined three contemporaneous flows of activities for qualitative analysis (Miles et al.,2014) and constituted the 'Data Analysis Interactive Model' (Figure4). The authors proffered that the three streams should be 'interwoven before, during, and after data collection in parallel form, to make up the general domain called \"analysis\"' (Miles et al.,2014, p. 14).

The activities are as follows:Data condensationData displayConclusion drawing and verification.FIGURE 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointResearch method. QMS, quality management system3.3.3 Data condensationData condensation refers to the data transformation process of selecting, focusing, and simplifying the data that appeared in the entire body of written-up field notes, interview transcripts, documents, and other empirical materials (Hesey Biber & Leavy,2006; Miles et al.,2014). This commenced with the transcription of individual interviews to a computer file in Microsoft Word. Bryman (2012) and Yin (2016) recommended that qualitative data analysis starts with coding data by identifying data that are potential evidence to answer research questions. Coding is 'the key process in grounded theory, whereby data are broken down into components, which are given names' (Bryman,2012, p. 569). Aspects of the data were assigned (single or combined words, letters, numbers, phrases, colours) for easy retrieval (Merriam,2009). The classified coding added greater value and strengthened the data (Glesne,2011; Miles et al.,2014; Yin,2016).The saturation point was realized when the coding and categorization were exhausted, and no new themes or pertinent information could be derived from the iterative process (Onwuegbuzie & Byers,2014).3.3.4 Data verificationThe categorization and sub-categorization of the interviews were"
"when the coding and categorization were exhausted, and no new themes or pertinent information could be derived from the iterative process (Onwuegbuzie & Byers,2014).3.3.4 Data verificationThe categorization and sub-categorization of the interviews were well aligned with the research questions and objectives and allowed the researcher to develop themes, patterns, and conclusions, thus supporting the inductive approach (Wilkinson & Birmingham,2003). In addition, the researcher utilized member checking. This process aided feedback from the interviewees regarding the presentation and discussion of the compiled data from the interviews (Glesne,2011; Harper & Cole,2012). Hence the reliability and validity of the instruments used for data collection were enhanced.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSeventeen (17) barriers were identified and formed the proposed empirical framework for the AMOs within the geographical demarcation of the Anglophone Caribbean, as shown in Figure5. The categories of barriers identified are as follows:Eight (8) resource barriers: Insufficient staff, lack of financial resources, lack of quality management training and education, high cost of certification, lack of government support, lack of a quality manager, and lack of consultants. The most critical were insufficient staff and lack of financial resources.Three (3) organizational barriers: Iack of top management commitment, lack of internal audits and management reviews, and a lack of a recognition and rewards"
"lack of consultants. The most critical were insufficient staff and lack of financial resources.Three (3) organizational barriers: Iack of top management commitment, lack of internal audits and management reviews, and a lack of a recognition and rewards system. The most critical was lack of top management commitment, which is congruent with the studies of Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011), Abu-Khadra et al. (2012), and Solomon et al. (2017).Four (4) technical barriers: Problems with equipment calibration, difficulty in the quality audit process, lack of guidance for certification, and a lack of a management information system.Two (2) cultural barriers: Resistance to change and difficulty in motivating staff.FIGURE 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointProposed empirical framework of barriers to the implementation of ISO 9001:2015 quality management system (QMS) implementation within the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices (AMOs) of the Anglophone Caribbean4.1 Resource barriersThe largest category of barriers identified was resource barriers, accounting for almost half (47%) of the total, followed by technical, organizational, and cultural factors. This finding differs from some of the studies that were utilized in the conceptual framework (Abdullah et al.,2013; Abu-Khadra et al.,2012; Al-Asiri,2004; Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011; Amar & Zain,2002; Bounabri et al.,2017; Magd,2008; Sharif,2005; Zeng et al.,2007) where the largest category of barriers was organizational.The prevalence"
"framework (Abdullah et al.,2013; Abu-Khadra et al.,2012; Al-Asiri,2004; Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011; Amar & Zain,2002; Bounabri et al.,2017; Magd,2008; Sharif,2005; Zeng et al.,2007) where the largest category of barriers was organizational.The prevalence of the resource barriers signals a deeper problem that encircles the leadership, which is ultimately responsible for allocating and disbursing resources. ISO 9001:2015 Clause 7.1 pertains to resources that are imperative for a sustainable QMS, while Clause 5.1, which deals with leadership and commitment, emphasizes the responsibility of top management for the necessary support for QMS implementation, maintenance, and monitoring (ISO,2015a).Therefore, government support is critical since 79% of the AMOs are part of the Public Service and 21% part of statutory bodies. The statutory bodies are managed by a Board of Directors and are ultimately responsible to the respective Minister and thus are also dependent on the government for support.Eight resource barriers were discovered as per Figure5. The highest percentage (79%) of respondents indicated that insufficient staff and the lack of financial resources were barriers within their organizations, followed by lack of QMS training (62%). The most critical resource barriers were insufficient staff (65%) and insufficient financial resources (58%).The insufficient staff as a barrier was also identified in some other organizations from studies explored within the conceptual framework,"
"(62%). The most critical resource barriers were insufficient staff (65%) and insufficient financial resources (58%).The insufficient staff as a barrier was also identified in some other organizations from studies explored within the conceptual framework, namely Indonesia Manufacturing Organizations (Amar & Zain,2002) and in Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors (Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011). Lack of financial resources was also a barrier for the LMPSOs (Sharif,2005); Egyptian Manufacturing Organizations. Magd (2008), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) and was the only initial barrier for the Canadian Meteorological Services (NMHs) according to Yuzyk, Thomson, and Cantin (2016). The authors note that despite the initial costs, as the QMS matured, the benefits superseded the costs.4.1.1 Insufficient staffThe insufficient staff has resulted in important processes such as active monitoring, document and record control, quality control not being performed promptly, and non-conformities not being addressed. It also meant that staff could not be designated roles, ultimately leading to an unsustainable QMS. Similar impacts were noted in Indonesia's Manufacturing Organizations where Amar and Zain (2002) found that insufficiently trained staff delayed the QMS process. Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) discovered high worker turnover in Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors contributed to an inefficient QMS.4.1.2 Lack of financial resourcesThe lack of financial resources and limited training contributed"
"the QMS process. Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) discovered high worker turnover in Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors contributed to an inefficient QMS.4.1.2 Lack of financial resourcesThe lack of financial resources and limited training contributed to the lack of understanding of the standards. It also constrained the recruitment of additional staff, consultants, and auditors and affected the purchasing of spare instruments, inducing risks of marginal performance into the QMS. Similar impacts were reported in the Egyptian Manufacturing Organizations by Magd (2008) and Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011). In a previous study, Sharif (2005) found additional impacts from a restricted budget in the LMPSOs, which were delayed payments of wages and calibration of equipment, and difficulty in the procurement of machines and raw materials, which led to higher maintenance costs.4.2 Organizational barriersOrganizational barriers identified were lack of top management commitment (46%), inadequate monitoring and internal auditing (62%), and lack of recognition and rewards system (55%). The most critical barrier is the lack of top management commitment (55%). This barrier was also existent in eight of the 11 organizations that were analysed in the conceptual framework, namely, Indonesia Manufacturing Organizations (Amar & Zain,2002), Saudi Arabia Business Organizations (Al-Asiri,2004), LMPSOs (Sharif,2005), Egyptian Manufacturing Organizations (Magd,2008), Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors"
"the conceptual framework, namely, Indonesia Manufacturing Organizations (Amar & Zain,2002), Saudi Arabia Business Organizations (Al-Asiri,2004), LMPSOs (Sharif,2005), Egyptian Manufacturing Organizations (Magd,2008), Iraq Service and Manufacturing Sectors (Al-Najjar & Jawad,2011), Jordan Private Mobile Companies (Abu-Khadra et al.,2012), South Africa Eskom Holdings' Electricity Supply Industry Solomon et al. (2017), Morocco Service and Manufacturing Certified Companies (Bounabri et al.,2017). In contrast, Yuzyk, Thomson, and Cantin (2016) attribute the success of NHMS in Canada to the active engagement of top management.Inadequate monitoring and internal audits were barriers to LMPSOs (Sharif,2005) and Jordan private mobile companies, Abu-Khadra et al. (2012). Lack of recognition and rewards system was also existent in Sharif (2005).4.2.1 Lack of commitment from the executive managementLack of top management commitment, which is a direct reflection of the failure of leadership, can be attributed to the prevalence of resource barriers. Most of the AMOs interviewed indicated that this barrier has a domino effect on every facet of the QMS, from planning, implementing, measuring, and refining. It has resulted in the objectives of the QMS not being met and also introduced more delays and impediments to staff performance and evaluation. Magd (2008) stated that improvement of the QMS was affected when responsibilities were not correctly delineated. Thus, a consistent level of"
"of the QMS not being met and also introduced more delays and impediments to staff performance and evaluation. Magd (2008) stated that improvement of the QMS was affected when responsibilities were not correctly delineated. Thus, a consistent level of products and services could not be maintained. Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) reported similar impacts and attributed the lack of commitment to dedication or understanding of quality. These impacts were echoed by Abu-Khadra et al. (2012) and Solomon et al. (2017).4.3 Technical barriersFour technical barriers identified were problems with equipment calibration (62%), lack of guidance for certification (57%), difficulty in the quality audit process (53%), and lack of proper management information system (50%). The three most critical barriers were problems with equipment calibration (75%), lack of guidance for certification (54%), and difficulty in the quality audit process (54%). Problems with equipment calibration and lack of guidance for certification were both identified in Sharif (2005). Lack of guidance for certification was found in a previous study by Al-Asiri (2004) and Zeng et al. (2007). Difficulty in the quality audit process and lack of a proper management information system existed in the studies of Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) and Abu-Khadra et al. (2012).4.3.1 Problems with equipment calibrationThis barrier has led to the inability of many of the AMOs to validate the accuracy of measurement of meteorological parameters"
"existed in the studies of Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) and Abu-Khadra et al. (2012).4.3.1 Problems with equipment calibrationThis barrier has led to the inability of many of the AMOs to validate the accuracy of measurement of meteorological parameters and compromised effective monitoring. It has been amplified due to the lack of financial resources to purchase spares on time and to meet costs associated with the shipping to the regional calibration lab. Sharif (2005) indicated that the scarcity of standardized calibration labs in Libya and the vast costs of services from external labs contributed to uncalibrated tools and erroneous readings. This was exacerbated by financial constraints, resulting in delayed payments to the labs.4.3.2 Difficulty in the quality audit processThis barrier compromised the QMS because proper evaluations could not be made about the performance of the system on time. As a result, non-conformities could not be identified or corrected, thus leading to stagnation within the QMS. The level of difficulties and inefficiencies tends to increase when budgetary support is not available, thus affecting adequate quality training, and leading to a lower level of understanding. These impacts are parallel to the studies of Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011).4.3.3 Lack of guidance for certificationLack of guidance for certification has led to a slower QMS documentation and implementation rate.

"studies of Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011).4.3.3 Lack of guidance for certificationLack of guidance for certification has led to a slower QMS documentation and implementation rate. The availability of consultants and quality training hinge on proper resource management within the QMS. Hence, without top management commitment, the impacts are more extreme. Al-Asiri (2004) and Sharif (2005) found that a lack of external consultants led to less understanding of the standard and, consequentially, more non-conformities within the QMS. Zeng et al. (2007) indicated a higher rate of audit failure when consultants of certifying bodies did not properly maintain the audit system.4.4 Cultural barriersTwo cultural barriers were identified: difficulty in motivating staff (62%) and resistance to change (59%), which were also the most critical (63%). Noteworthy is also the lack of organizational quality culture, which 48% of the respondents identified as a barrier within the AMOs. Both barriers point to an organizational quality culture that has not been fully cultivated, which warrants the attention of the leadership. The study of the conceptual framework where difficulty in motivating staff was a barrier was stated in Magd (2008), while resistance to change was evident in the studies of Sharif (2005), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) and Abu-Khadra et al. (2012) and Bounabri et al. (2017).4.4.1 Difficulty in motivating staffThis barrier has led to lower employee involvement, resulting in reduced"
"to change was evident in the studies of Sharif (2005), Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) and Abu-Khadra et al. (2012) and Bounabri et al. (2017).4.4.1 Difficulty in motivating staffThis barrier has led to lower employee involvement, resulting in reduced productivity. This situation has been aggravated due to negative quality culture and the absence of an established reward and recognition system. Magd (2008) found that difficulty in motivating staff stemmed from a lack of organizational commitment. Additionally, there was a greater tendency of employees to attach lower priority to QMS when there is no visible engagement, thus introducing static into the system.4.4.2 Resistance to changeThis barrier is also a direct result of poor quality culture and the lack of understanding of the benefits of QMS. It has negatively impacted the level of monitoring and performance within the QMS, leading to the underachievement of strategic objectives and stagnation within the QMS. Sharif (2005) discovered that the restrictions by the law for non-payment of overtime in Libya coupled with no tangible incentives or rewards for performance fuelled more resistance in QMS. In addition, lack of top management commitment fostered more resistors than advocators of quality. Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) discovered that ignorance of the standards evoked fear within employees and hindered willing adoption. Along a similar line of discussion, Abdullah et al.

"advocators of quality. Al-Najjar and Jawad (2011) discovered that ignorance of the standards evoked fear within employees and hindered willing adoption. Along a similar line of discussion, Abdullah et al. (2013) found that the perceived disruption of the comfort zone and level of contentedness led to more friction within the QMS.Throughout the barriers identified and corresponding impacts, the human and leadership commitment factors reverberate. These findings are of utmost significance for policymakers, who can identify the barriers and devise strategies to reduce or eradicate them and harness the effective implementation of ISO 9001:2015.4.5 Lessons learned from Trinidad's AMOThe findings indicate that Trinidad AMO struggles with the resource, organizational, technical, and cultural barriers that hinder the successful implementation of ISO 9001:2015. Therefore, the following lessons are pertinent to all AMOs of the Anglophone Caribbean.Executive management's commitment is imperative for successful implementation of standards. Leadership is the nucleus of sustainable QMS. Management must provide necessary resources, including human and financial resources and infrastructure. According to the TTMS Quality Manager, 'Management must embrace a more transformational approach instead of the perceived laissez-faire approach' (TTMS Quality Manager Ag.,2019). The Climatologist emphasized that 'at the higher echelons there must be greater accountability' (TTMS Climatologist 2019).An"
"must embrace a more transformational approach instead of the perceived laissez-faire approach' (TTMS Quality Manager Ag.,2019). The Climatologist emphasized that 'at the higher echelons there must be greater accountability' (TTMS Climatologist 2019).An enabling organizational structure is critical for optimal performance of the QMS. The structure should support the functions of the QMS that include implementation and monitoring and evaluation of performance. Each employee's roles, responsibilities, and targets must be clearly articulated, measured, and documented consistently.A positive quality culture must be embedded into the QMS to drive successful implementation. Top management must engage and sensitize staff on the goals of and benefits from QMS and promote delivery of quality service throughout the organization. Formal recognition and rewards system helps to motivate staff towards greater efficiency.Effective communication is necessary to achieve the objectives of QMS. It fosters a greater understanding of quality management and promotes behavioural change.5 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONSOf the thirty-seven (37) barriers to ISO 9001 quality management system (QMS) in the conceptual framework, seventeen (17) barriers were identified in this study and formed the new empirical framework for the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices (AMOs) in the Anglophone Caribbean.

"were identified in this study and formed the new empirical framework for the Aeronautical Meteorological Offices (AMOs) in the Anglophone Caribbean. Most barriers were categorized under resources that differ from the studies summarized in the literature review. The most common category of barriers was organizational. The lessons learned from the literature and Trinidad case study were briefed below.Inwardly oriented motivation generates better performance within the QMSLeadership engagement and commitment are central to the success of the QMS.The initial state of QMS commencement must be determined so that strategic actions can be taken to navigate to the state of 100% formally alive.A process-wise approach should be adopted for implementation as advocated by World Meteorological Organization (WMO).Effective auditing is critical for successful QMS implementation, monitoring, and sustainability.Enabling organizational structure is critical for optimal performance within the QMS.A positive quality culture must be embedded into the QMS to drive successful implementation.The following recommendations were geared towards successful QMS implementation and certification by transitioning the AMOs from any of these states of 'Complete Death', Informally Alive, and 'Formally Alive' to the optimal state of '100% Formally Alive'.5.1 LeadershipExecutive management should:Adopt a more engaging and transformational style of leadership that will improve the communication channel within the"
"Death', Informally Alive, and 'Formally Alive' to the optimal state of '100% Formally Alive'.5.1 LeadershipExecutive management should:Adopt a more engaging and transformational style of leadership that will improve the communication channel within the QMS and assist in alleviating the organizational barriers.Ensure a general appreciation of the principles of ISO 9001 QMS, which will engender greater commitment to the process.Ensure that there is alignment between the organization's quality policy and its vision, mission, and values.Institute enabling organizational structure to accommodate the function of a quality manager and supporting positions to sustain the QMS.Engrain quality control and assurance into each position within the AMO from the observers, climatologists, forecasters, and intermediate managers to encourage higher staff involvement.Model a positive quality culture and sensitize staff on the benefits of QMS to negate resistance to change and alleviate the cultural barriers.5.2 Engagement of peopleExecutive management should establish an appropriate performance management system with clearly defined targets and metrics and a corresponding rewards and recognition system to encourage staff involvement and address the organizational barriers.Management should adopt a process-wise or incremental approach as advocated by WMO and utilize risk-based thinking to successfully implement QMS to boost staff confidence and involvement.Management should facilitate dialog"
"the organizational barriers.Management should adopt a process-wise or incremental approach as advocated by WMO and utilize risk-based thinking to successfully implement QMS to boost staff confidence and involvement.Management should facilitate dialog about QMS by encouraging feedback from all levels of staff; QMS should not be attached to a name tag, but rather every staff member is an important link in the system.5.3 SupportThe government or top management should ensure that adequate human (including staff and consultants), training, financial, and infrastructure are provided on time to support QMS to alleviate the resource barriers.Basic training should be provided to all staff to sensitize them on the principles of ISO 9001.Caribbean Meteorological Organization (CMO) and the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) should coordinate specialized QMS training for ISO 9001:2015 within AMOs, particularly in documentation, risk management, and auditing, which will assist in building a regional team to foster organizational strengthening within the Anglophone Caribbean.A proper management information system should be implemented, which will refine the processes and support greater efficiency within the system.Trinidad's AMO and other AMOs within the region with expertise in QMS should commit to assisting the other AMOs in QMS implementation.CMO should continue to use the CARICOM (Caribbean Community) meetings as a platform to advocate for partnership funding for"
"AMO and other AMOs within the region with expertise in QMS should commit to assisting the other AMOs in QMS implementation.CMO should continue to use the CARICOM (Caribbean Community) meetings as a platform to advocate for partnership funding for QMS implementation.The Governments of the Organization Eastern Caribbean States should engage Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority so that the organization will be held accountable for providing guidance and QMS audit and oversight.CIMH and the AMOs should establish a strategy towards efficient calibration to determine whether the need exists for additional capacity in that area or future training to foster efficient measuring and sustainability of the QMS.5.4 Monitoring and evaluationMiddle managers/shift supervisors/forecasters should consistently engage in quality control and monitoring of the QMS.An effective audit cycle should be established and followed to prevent and correct non-conformities within the QMS in a timely and consistent manner to alleviate the technical barriers.Executive management should ensure that management reviews are conducted at least quarterly to ensure that the products and services conform to the standards and that non-conformities, needs, and opportunities can be addressed on time.5.5 Research limitationThe research was limited by the geographical location, Anglophone Caribbean, and the type of service organization: Aeronautical Meteorological Offices.

"opportunities can be addressed on time.5.5 Research limitationThe research was limited by the geographical location, Anglophone Caribbean, and the type of service organization: Aeronautical Meteorological Offices. All examined organizations dealt with the barriers in implementing QMS. Only one case study examined the problem area within a meteorological service. The study was constrained by the frequency of responses to the questionnaire and the scheduling of interviews with the Managers and Quality Managers of the AMOs. The questionnaire was not completed by Turks and Caicos AMO, and only one participant from some offices completed the survey questionnaire. Due to travel engagements and work constraints, interviews could not be conducted with the Managers/Directors of St Vincent, Jamaica, and the Senior Forecaster in Grenada. Hence, the interviews were completed via email, and follow-up calls were made for further information where needed. The researcher suggests future research within the Anglophone Caribbean on comprehensive analysis of the impact of organizational culture on QMS implementation, analysis of the critical success factors for ISO 9001 QMS implementation, and impact of leadership styles on QMS implementation.

"status management modules, designed student scholarship, statistics, and data management modules, constructed a student information management system for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode, and finally carried out a case application and its result analysis. The study results show that the probabilistic random matrix management mode is a combination of linear and flat organizational structures and has the advantages of short information lines, fast information feedback, and high operation efficiency; it can input the matrix form of prior data and use statistical probability knowledge to derive the probability density function of posterior feature vector and predict the recommendation result through feature vector. The probabilistic random matrix management mode first calculates student's behavior sequence through their management information and then calculates the student's preference sequence according to their behavior sequence and label information and subsequently calculates the similarity matrixes about the students and their information and finally integrates the obtained student similarity matrix into the probabilistic matrix factorization model.1.

"in colleges and universities is an important part of the management of higher education. The success or failure of the student information management directly affects the quality of education and teaching in colleges and universities and affects the teaching order. The student information management in higher education is the basis of electronic registration, and ensuring the submission of true and accurate student data is an important content and task of management [1]. The management of higher education student information should gradually break through the restrictions between various types of education and advocate interactive learning and mutual recognition of achievements between various learning forms. The content of student information management of higher education involves the registration of new students, the review of the admission list, the review of student information changes, and the review of the student registration list [2]. The traditional manual management method not only has high labor intensity, slow operation speed, poor confidentiality, and low efficiency, but also is prone to statistical errors and data loss [3]. The use of computer means to carry out traditional manual management methods to improve the efficiency and level of management, for example, the development of the student information management information system in universities, can reduce errors in manual operation process, avoid fraud, and improve work efficiency [4].As an evolution of"
"the efficiency and level of management, for example, the development of the student information management information system in universities, can reduce errors in manual operation process, avoid fraud, and improve work efficiency [4].As an evolution of organizational structure, the matrix management mode is a combination of linear and flat. Probabilistic random matrix itself is a mathematical concept, an algebraic method of solving problems by establishing the structure of the system [5]. The probabilistic random matrix management mode is characterized by strong interactivity, safe access mode, low network traffic, and fast response speed and is conducive to processing large amounts of data. As a representative model-based collaborative filtering algorithm, the probabilistic random matrix factorization algorithm is widely popular due to its high accuracy and scalability. Therefore, matrix management is a good supplement to linear management and is mainly suitable for frequent changes in work content [6]. The completion of each job requires an organization supported by many technologies and knowledge or as a supplementary structural form when arranging temporary tasks. The probabilistic matrix factorization recommendation algorithm has improved management prediction accuracy, but the algorithm often faces the disadvantage of sparse data in practical applications, and the utilization efficiency of the existing data is not high [7].

"has improved management prediction accuracy, but the algorithm often faces the disadvantage of sparse data in practical applications, and the utilization efficiency of the existing data is not high [7]. The algorithm is superior to the traditional recommendation algorithm, and from the perspective of students or student information, the integration of student behavior sequence information can improve the accuracy of management prediction. The probabilistic random matrix management mode includes the management information of students and the label information of student information, but there is no information such as students' social trust [8].On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous literatures, this study expounds the research status and significance of student information management of higher education, elaborates the development background, current status, and future challenges of probabilistic random matrix management mode, introduces the methods and principles of probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm and random matrix factorization model, discusses the service and supervision functions of student information management, analyzes the incentive and guiding functions of student information management, conducts the process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode, establishes student identity document and student status management modules, designs student scholarship, statistics,"

The detailed chapters are arranged as follows: Section2introduces the methods and principles of probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm and random matrix factorization model; Section3conducts the process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode; Section4constructs a student information management system for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode; Section5carries out a case application and its result analysis; Section6is the summary and conclusion of the whole paper.2.

"each measurement should have the same statistical validity. Therefore, in the design of probabilistic random matrix, the probability of row vectorAiof random matrix is defined as follows:(1)wherebiis the probability of the measurement matrix, that is, the ratio of the number of nonzero elements of the matrix to the total number of elements;ciis the measurement value vector;diis the measurement matrix;eiis the vector composed of transformation coefficients;fiis the zero norm of the signal, that is, the number of signal values that are not zero.A management mode is integrated into the probabilistic random matrix, and the student information matrix and management mode matrix are decomposed at the same time to obtain a potential student information feature space; according to the shared feature space, the student information matrix and the management mode matrix are compactly linked, and the probabilistic random matrix. The posterior distribution which recommended by the management model can be obtained by taking the logarithm:(2)whereBijis an indicator function; if a random matrix is satisfied between the student's student informationiand the student's status informationj, its value is 1; otherwise it is 0;mis the total number of student information;gijis a constant that does not depend on parameters; the optimized posterior distribution function is equivalent to the minimized objective function;hijis used to adjust the proportion of the impact of the student rating matrix and"
"of student information;gijis a constant that does not depend on parameters; the optimized posterior distribution function is equivalent to the minimized objective function;hijis used to adjust the proportion of the impact of the student rating matrix and the student information matrix on the recommendation result.When the probability sparse random matrix is selected as the measurement matrix, the distribution of effective projection nodes is relatively concentrated, while when the sparse random matrix and the sparse measurement matrix are selected as the measurement matrix, the effective projection nodes are evenly distributed in the entire monitoring area. This is because the design of the probability sparse random matrix makes full use of the position distribution information of nodes and controls the probability of nodes being selected as valid projection nodes, so that the distribution of valid projection nodes corresponding to the same measurement value is as centralized as possible [9]. The algorithm describes the student information from a new perspective in the form of a matrix; according to the value of the random matrix, the researcher can intuitively understand whether a student belongs to a certain random. While the other two sparse constructions of the matrix do not consider the position distribution information of the nodes, the effective projection node distribution is very scattered.

"the other two sparse constructions of the matrix do not consider the position distribution information of the nodes, the effective projection node distribution is very scattered. The database content is placed on the server, and the corresponding software is installed on the client for calculation and processing. It is characterized by strong interactivity, safe access mode, low network traffic, and fast response speed and is conducive to processing large amounts of data; however, the program of this structure has poor compatibility and is difficult to maintain and manage.2.2.

The probabilistic random matrix factorization algorithm uses the knowledge of statistical probability to obtain the probability density function of the posterior eigenvector by inputting the matrix form of the prior data and predicts the recommendation result through the eigenvector. Eigenvectors are the output results of the matrix decomposition algorithm, and their potential information is richer than the original data."
"by inputting the matrix form of the prior data and predicts the recommendation result through the eigenvector. Eigenvectors are the output results of the matrix decomposition algorithm, and their potential information is richer than the original data. Analyzing the eigenvectors is helpful to understand the principle of the algorithm [10]. The random matrix describes the student information from a new perspective in the form of a matrix; according to the value of the random matrix, the researcher can intuitively understand whether a student belongs to a certain random. If the affiliation between the student and the random is known, the researcher can build a random matrix. Through the random division algorithm, the student registration information can be expressed in a random form. The random matrix can be decomposed to obtain the random characteristic matrix of students and the random characteristic matrix. Since the random characteristics of students will have an impact on the characteristics of students, the random adjustment parameters are defined, and the probabilistic random matrix decomposition of the joint scoring matrix is deduced.3.

"Probabilistic Random Matrix Management Mode3.1. Service and Supervision Functions of Student Information ManagementThe probabilistic random matrix is an improvement to the random matrix and its core idea is to identify the particles with high likelihood value for the observation value at the next moment through an auxiliary variable and then use these particles with high likelihood value for filtering and summarization to improve the accuracy of the estimation. Therefore, the probabilistic random matrix management mode is very suitable for handling the state estimation problems of hybrid systems such as manoeuvring target tracking. According to the characteristics of the probabilistic random matrix, the likelihood values of the sampled particles in each model can be accumulated, and the accumulated sum of the results can be regarded as the likelihood value of each model. After such processing, the likelihood values of the particles identified by the auxiliary variables can not only be used to calculate the probabilities of each model, but also be used for online estimation of the transition probability matrix at the same time.

"restrictions between various types of education and advocate interactive learning and mutual recognition of achievements between various learning forms. In order to adapt to all kinds of students' learning and alleviate students' work-study conflicts, and family-study conflicts, the probabilistic random matrix management mode can break the restrictions between various school-running forms and realize the organic combination of various forms. The student information management system can stipulate the minimum number of course selections for students each semester and must strictly enforce the discipline of attendance and strengthen the daily management of students.Figure1shows the framework of process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode. According to the specific situation of transferring schools and majors, according to the teaching requirements, the same or similar relevant information that can be identified is logged in the first form, and the relevant information that cannot be identified at all with large differences is logged in the second form. The credits that are not recognized in the second form can be used as supplementary credits when students graduate from optional courses, so it is very beneficial for students to recognize their scores in time.

"students graduate from optional courses, so it is very beneficial for students to recognize their scores in time. The probabilistic random matrix management mode also opens the online course selection channel according to the specific situation of the students. For the compulsory courses that have not been taken, the students should make up-election and supplementary courses in time to obtain the corresponding credits, so as to avoid the remaining problems caused by the transfer of schools and majors. This requires students engaged in student information management to pay more attention to the improvement of comprehensive business ability on the basis of strengthening theoretical study and to use the educational administration system software more carefully [11]. The probabilistic random matrix management mode combines student information management and course selection management and is no longer treated in isolation, which gives full play to the role of computer software and is more efficient in student information management. This mode manages the application system as much as possible and at the same time consciously explores the corresponding requirements for system redevelopment.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointFramework of process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode.With the deepening of the reform of the internal management system in colleges and universities, this team is also"
"of process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode.With the deepening of the reform of the internal management system in colleges and universities, this team is also faced with new tasks and requirements. Only by correctly analyzing the main problems existing in the construction of the university student information management personnel team, adopting scientific management methods and methods, strengthening training, and continuously improving the quality, can the university student information management personnel team be better built [12]. The student information management in colleges and universities has its own subject knowledge background, which is the product of the combination of educational practice and management laws. It has its own unique research objects, research contents, and research methods, which cannot be replaced by other disciplines. Taking the management of school status as a science and an art, the model should seriously study the laws of school status management and maximize the role of the school's material and financial resources, so as to achieve the highest work efficiency and exchange for the best benefits.

"information management is a very specific, complicated, and highly policy-oriented work. The student information management should also actively adapt to the development of the new situation, update concepts, and enhance the awareness of management and education. According to the requirements of different training stages, the establishment and change of student information, electronic registration, graduation diploma and degree, etc. should give full play to their influence. The service role and policy-oriented role of the teaching process improve the management level.3.2. Incentive and Guiding Functions of Student Information ManagementThe probabilistic random matrix management mode does not necessarily deny the past professional division of labor theory but is an effective supplement and reform of the original professional division of labor theory. The student information management in colleges and universities is a work with strong principles and policies, which not only has strict regulations on the student information management, but also has a sound legal basis. At the same time, the student information management also has a certain degree of flexibility. In the process of normal student information processing, various specific problems are often encountered, which requires a combination of principle and flexibility for fair and proper handling.

"various specific problems are often encountered, which requires a combination of principle and flexibility for fair and proper handling. As shown in Figure2(a), the proposal and development of the theory of probabilistic random matrix management mode is precisely because of the traditional division of labor business logic, which brings bad customer experience to users and reduces work efficiency. As shown in Figure2(b), the business probabilistic random matrix management mode will reorganize the business facing customers, so it can more effectively adapt to the customer-centric management system; while the student information management is just a typical management system, the student information management must serve students. Therefore, the existing student information management affairs cannot simply be moved to the computer for processing, and the traditional working methods and methods and procedures of the student information management must be reexamined, and the necessary cleaning, simplification, optimization, integration, and transformation must be carried out [13].Figure 2(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointProbabilistic random matrix management mode applied in the student identity document (ID) (a) and scholarship (b) management.Figure 2(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointProbabilistic random matrix management mode applied in the student identity document (ID) (a) and scholarship (b) management.If these inputs are not completely independent, the output probability"
"(b) management.Figure 2(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointProbabilistic random matrix management mode applied in the student identity document (ID) (a) and scholarship (b) management.If these inputs are not completely independent, the output probability needs to be modified. For simple systems, in the probability expansion of the output signal, the probability of the high-order term of the common signal can be directly replaced by the first-order term. But for complex systems with multiple common signals and multiple logic gates, the derivation and calculation process of the probability expansion will become very complicated. The student information management is the management of student identity document card first; the function of student identity document card query can be used by anyone, but the modification and deletion of student identity document card must be the responsibility of a special person, so the authority is specific to the module [14]. The student information management changes has been transformed from the original paper and pen records to the storage in the machine, which is convenient for searching and statistics; various statistics are made on the above data, and the student information number is used as the keyword to query and modify them (Figure3).

The reward and punishment system and scholarship evaluation are now entering the student's reward and punishment according to the grade and linking him with the integrity file in the work-study program, so that the basic situation of a student can be known based on natural information. The scholarship evaluation is integrated into the student information management and the faculties and departments conduct a three-level evaluation and then import the above data into the student information management of the student affairs office, and a special person will conduct a comprehensive evaluation.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointProbabilistic random matrix in the student identity document (ID) (a), status (b), data (c), and scholarship (d) management.Colleges and universities should plan to strengthen the training and construction of the professional quality of student information management workers and establish and improve the continuing education mechanism.

"personnel, combining theoretical training with practical training, domestic training and overseas training, short-term training, and vocational education. Colleges and universities should affirm the status and role of student information workers and not only make reasonable adjustments to the structure of the school's student information management team, but also establish an effective talent incentive mechanism. The construction of the student information management system in colleges and universities must follow the requirements of the law. The school student information management system must not only maintain the seriousness of the system, but also safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of students. If a job is highly specialized and relatively single, then it is not suitable for the business probabilistic random matrix management mode. From student registration, student information change, and grade entry to graduation, it runs through the complete learning process of students. It can be said that the process of student information management is a highly concentrated process for students to receive higher education and the student information management has distinct process characteristics. The programmatic content of student information management refers not only to the flow of management procedures, but also to the standardization process of school status management.4.

"content of student information management refers not only to the flow of management procedures, but also to the standardization process of school status management.4. System Construction of Student Information Management for Higher Education Based on Probabilistic Random Matrix Management Mode4.1. Student Identity Document and Student Status Management ModulesThe system database is mainly designed from three aspects, namely, information management, achievement management, system maintenance, and help information. The choice of data table directly affects the integrity of student information management, data redundancy, and data response speed and thus affects the use of students. In order to meet the requirements of student information management, the database of this system has been established including student number, class number, name, gender, date of birth, nationality, place of origin, political identity, health status, identity document number, mailing address, postal code, contact number, and professional fourteen data sheets including code, class code, notes, and photos [15]. Student information management is not an isolated task, and it is closely related to other teaching management links. Therefore, in order to avoid and eliminate the occurrence of various problems in the process of student information management, the entire teaching management team needs to establish quality awareness, implement process control, and implement fine-tuning. As shown in Figure4,"

As shown in Figure4, the joint school between schools is very complicated, and it is necessary to do a good job in teaching management and student management in order to receive the expected results. The charging scheme of the school will enable the smooth implementation of the joint school-running between schools.Figure 4(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointStudent statistics (a), status (b), and course (c) management in student identity document and student status management modules.Figure 4(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointStudent statistics (a), status (b), and course (c) management in student identity document and student status management modules.Figure 4(c)Open in figure viewerPowerPointStudent statistics (a), status (b), and course (c) management in student identity document and student status management modules.The application of probabilistic random matrix management in student information management of higher education can make up for the insufficiency of the linear functional teaching management model and realize the organic combination of project management and linear functional management.

"management model and realize the organic combination of project management and linear functional management. Vertically, it is a linear functional management, which is macrocontrolled by the school level, and the department is responsible for process management, which conforms to the law of teaching management; horizontally, it is project management, and the project leaders are responsible for each project. It is organized according to the project, overcomes the phenomenon of division between departments and blaming each other, strengthens the connection between school and society, management department and department, and department and department and overcomes the disconnection of various departments in the linear functional structure (Figure5). It is flexible and can be organized or disbanded with the beginning and end of a project. One person can also participate in several project teams at the same time, which greatly improves the utilization rate of personnel. Staff are directly involved in the project and have a say in important decision-making issues, increasing the accountability and motivation of the participants. Through the combination of horizontal and vertical management, staff can get in touch with staff in the subject area and also have the opportunity to communicate and cooperate with experts and teaching administrators and gain access to more knowledge and skills.Figure 5(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between matrix eigenvalue and"

All colleges and universities should communicate with each other, realize real-time information feedback with each teaching point, realize open management, and realize the linkage of horizontal management system. The management of higher education student information is actually a criss-crossed management system, with the ministry of education, the department of education, and colleges and universities vertically and colleges and affiliated units horizontally.

"and colleges and affiliated units horizontally. The linkage of the three-level management system formed by the ministry of education, the department of education, and colleges and universities has played a key role in the standardization and high-quality operation of the entire management system [16]. The probabilistic random matrix management mode is a two-layer structure mode in which the client and the server jointly realize cooperative processing. Because the degree of difficulty of the course is different, the class time is different, the number of credits is different, and it includes the management of students and teaching management. For problems that have occurred, no matter how big or small, they must be submitted to the leaders, and the management personnel of each link should be brought together to discuss and analyze, reflect in time, strengthen the review of their own quality management, predict and control possible problems, and gradually eliminate the graduation export link. In the state of terminal inspection, focus on prior control and pursue continuous improvement.4.2. Student Scholarship, Statistics, and Data Management ModulesThe overall design of the student information management of higher education system should be based on the design concept of systems engineering, which manages student information data through network information sharing, making it extremely easy for operators to view information about students and their colleges through a browser."
"should be based on the design concept of systems engineering, which manages student information data through network information sharing, making it extremely easy for operators to view information about students and their colleges through a browser. Because the mode is managed through a probabilistic random matrix, the security problem has always been the primary problem to be solved in information sharing in the network. In order to solve the problem of network security, a two-level security guarantee system is adopted in the student information management system. The management efficiencies of student identity, scholarship, statistics, and data with probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm and random matrix factorization model are shown in Figure6. The probabilistic random matrix student information management model closely integrates teaching plans, course modules, course selection mechanisms, and evaluation systems by setting academic credits and comprehensive quality credits to ensure the normal operation and efficient implementation of the entire student information management model. In order to ensure the authority of data and the of information security, the authority and responsibility for the use of online information are stipulated. The characteristics of this system include strong practicability, strong security, fast system operation, and flexible use of the system and information; it can reduce errors in manual operation, avoid fraud, and enable better"

The linear structure is similar to a pyramid. Usually, the management mode of higher education student information is linear; the flat structure has fewer levels, large spans, and decentralized power. Supervision and control are relatively loose, and information is not communicated smoothly and probabilistic random matrix management is a combination of linear and flat management structures. Through the coordinated management of horizontal and vertical structural units, the information communication of each structural unit is strengthened, so that information lines in the process of work progress, fast feedback, and high efficiency in completing various businesses (Figure7)."
"of horizontal and vertical structural units, the information communication of each structural unit is strengthened, so that information lines in the process of work progress, fast feedback, and high efficiency in completing various businesses (Figure7). Probabilistic random matrix management is suitable for organizations with frequent changes in work content, involving a wide range of areas, requiring multiple businesses and knowledge support, or organizations with surprise task arrangements [17]. The vertical structure of matrix management in student information management of higher education is that different levels of student information management business posts are determined by the personnel system, which is managed by the subordinate business department; the horizontal structure is to complete a certain student information management. The work task group formed by the activity, a dynamic work team cantered on the activity task, is managed by the person in charge of the activity.Figure 7(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between matrix eigenvalue and matrix order (a) and probabilistic value (b) based on probabilistic random matrix management.Figure 7(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between matrix eigenvalue and matrix order (a) and probabilistic value (b) based on probabilistic random matrix management.The security system is composed of teaching plans, course modules, course selection mechanisms, evaluation systems, and student information"
"matrix eigenvalue and matrix order (a) and probabilistic value (b) based on probabilistic random matrix management.The security system is composed of teaching plans, course modules, course selection mechanisms, evaluation systems, and student information processing, which is a supporting element in the student information management model. It provides the operation basis, management basis, and practical guarantee for the smooth development of student information management and is the cornerstone of rationally distributing the overall teaching activities and each constituent element. The first-level security protection is dependent on the security provided by the network itself, and the network has a provision for users to use it. Security protection is to set a password in the program design module of the student information management information system and restrict the use rights of each user through the control function of the password. The institutional system is to establish a long-term working mechanism, formulate strong operational rules and regulations, clarify the corresponding functions of each department, form a relatively stable work procedure and activity framework, and realize the normal operation of the system [18].

"[18]. The probabilistic random matrix student information management model accurately grasps the internal connections and basic functions of various departments and links closely related to student information management from a macrolevel, emphasize the orderliness and operability of student information management activities, and establish a complete set of student information management systems. The management system and logistics support system have formed an institutional mechanism for each performing their own duties and cooperating with each other.5. Case Application and Its Result Analysis5.1. Case Background and Research DesignIn the process of generating the student information data to be registered, first of all, attention should be paid to the structural similarity between the original data table and the data table to be registered. In most cases, there are many similarities in the structure of the original data table and the data table to be registered, so the probabilistic random matrix management mode can directly fill the data in the same fields of the original data table and the data table to be registered into the data table to be registered. Alternatively, in the probabilistic random matrix management mode, the same field data in the original data table as the data table to be registered can be copied out as a prototype of the data table to be registered. In the process of generating the student information data, if encountering an equal difference sequence"
"the same field data in the original data table as the data table to be registered can be copied out as a prototype of the data table to be registered. In the process of generating the student information data, if encountering an equal difference sequence in which the data of a certain field is increasing from top to bottom, the loop structure in the structured programming can be used [19]. The probabilistic random matrix management mode first assigns a number to the first student and then, from top to bottom, always adds data to the previous student's number as the next student's number until the last student. The system can automatically fill in the numbers of all students by directly executing the prewritten program of the cyclic structure without manual input. When the data of all students in many fields in the student information data table are basically the same, the system can automatically fill in the data of all students in some fields with the same value.5.2. Result AnalysisIn the matrix management mode of university student information management, vertical management is the inherent functional department system of traditional university management departments, which constitutes a stable basic organizational unit and is managed by the leadership of the management department. Horizontal management is a work task project system composed to complete a certain task. For example, in order to strengthen the service for the management of the student information of the"
"and is managed by the leadership of the management department. Horizontal management is a work task project system composed to complete a certain task. For example, in order to strengthen the service for the management of the student information of the faculties and departments, the units are divided according to the faculties and departments, and several horizontal management lines are added to form a matrix management mode. In this vertical and horizontal matrix management mode, the vertical function division system ensures the stable operation of the basic work modules, and the horizontal management chain is committed to solving practical problems such as the integration and transmission of information between the departments and the management departments and can truly reflect the service spirit of the university management department [20]. The probabilistic random matrix management mode calculates the student's behavior sequence through the management information of the student's student information and calculates the student's preference sequence according to the student's behavior sequence and student information label information and then calculates the similarity matrix about the students and the similarity matrix about the student information, and finally, the obtained student similarity matrix is integrated into the probabilistic matrix factorization model.As shown in Figure8(a), the probabilistic random matrix management mode realizes the horizontal integration"
"about the student information, and finally, the obtained student similarity matrix is integrated into the probabilistic matrix factorization model.As shown in Figure8(a), the probabilistic random matrix management mode realizes the horizontal integration of the information quality of the university system, the intelligence system, and the public system in the horizontal row. In the vertical row, it realizes a systematic and divisional vertical connection for all kinds of students, and at the intersection of each matrix, it is to achieve an all-round three-dimensional radiation of educational content, skills, and application levels. As shown in Figure8(b), probabilistic random matrix management emphasizes resource sharing and cooperation, which is conducive to keeping pace, and adopts a unified strategy for the same situation, which improves the efficiency of resource utilization and forms an overall synergy. System risk mainly refers to some work risks arising from the management due to the legal but unreasonable design of the student information management system. Institutions often have guiding and restricting functions, and an unreasonable system will lead a job to deviate in an unreasonable direction, especially in systems related to graduation and degree awarding. In the absence of the review mechanism, although the student information administrators do their best to grasp every link, they are always worried or even afraid that their unintentional mistakes will lead to"
"related to graduation and degree awarding. In the absence of the review mechanism, although the student information administrators do their best to grasp every link, they are always worried or even afraid that their unintentional mistakes will lead to the leakage of student information, which will lead to information users making wrong judgments. All the responsibilities and pressures will be borne by one person in the student information management position and this kind of pressure and responsibility needs a mechanism to protect and share it [21].Figure 8(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between management efficiency and matrix probability in the service and supervision and incentive and guiding functions of student information management with probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm (a) and random matrix factorization model (b).Figure 8(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between management efficiency and matrix probability in the service and supervision and incentive and guiding functions of student information management with probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm (a) and random matrix factorization model (b).The dynamic nature of probabilistic random matrix management means that the matrix and its constituent elements, student information management, projects, and team members are all dynamically changing, and team members in the matrix can be transferred with the project in the horizontal management system or enter and exit the"
"the matrix and its constituent elements, student information management, projects, and team members are all dynamically changing, and team members in the matrix can be transferred with the project in the horizontal management system or enter and exit the project. The change of the project is not determined by whether the project is completed or not, but according to the changes inside and outside the matrix. With the changes of the project, the student information management in the matrix needs to make timely and dynamic adjustments and provide all-round service support such as system guarantee and resource supply. The dynamic development of the project also has the characteristics of stability and continuity; on the premise of keeping the core and direction of the project unchanged, this model can realize the continuous development of the project [22]. The horizontal is a management system for each subbusiness targeting student service projects, whose functions highlight the specialization of student work, focus on special work research and special business guidance, and establish a project management system and system.

Only when the horizontal and vertical work teams have clear responsibilities and close cooperation on the focus of each matrix and form a good cooperative relationship, can the effectiveness of the matrix management mode be truly exerted.6. ConclusionsThis study discussed the service and supervision functions of student information management, analyzed the incentive and guiding functions of student information management, conducted the process analysis of student information management for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode, established student identity document and student status management modules, designed student scholarship, statistics, and data management modules, constructed a student information management system for higher education based on probabilistic random matrix management mode, and finally carried out a case application and its result analysis. Vertically, it is a linear functional management, which is macrocontrolled by the school level, and the department is responsible for process management; horizontally, it is project management, and the project leaders are responsible for each project.

The probabilistic random matrix management mode can adopt a multilevel, multichannel, and multiform continuing education method according to the different knowledge levels and professional characteristics of the student management personnel, combining theoretical training with practical training, domestic training and overseas training, short-term training, and vocational education. The study results show that the probabilistic random matrix management mode is a combination of linear and flat organizational structures and has the advantages of short information lines, fast information feedback, and high operation efficiency; it can input the matrix form of prior data and use statistical probability knowledge to derive the probability density function of posterior feature vector and predict the recommendation result through feature vector. The probabilistic random matrix management mode first calculates student's behavior sequence through their management information and then calculates the student's preference sequence according to their behavior sequence and label information and subsequently calculates the similarity matrixes about the students and their information and finally integrates the obtained student similarity matrix into the probabilistic matrix factorization model.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that there are no conflicts of interest or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in"

"AbstractThe way by which artificial intelligence is implemented is similar to the thinking process of the human brain. People obtain information about external conditions through five senses, namely, vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and, through the further processing of the brain, it forms meaningful decision-making elements. Then, through the process of analysis and reasoning, further decisions are made. In the information age, the application of intelligent management information systems in various fields has promoted the modernization and intelligence of social development. From the perspective of intelligent decision-making, this paper analyzes the requirements of intelligent information systems and designs an intelligent information system based on mobile Internet management optimization, including system management optimization, and proposes an environment-based layer, network transport layer, and the three-tier system architecture of the smart service application layer. Finally, this paper considers the problem of data fusion after system expansion. According to the existing fuzzy fusion algorithm, a weight-based fuzzy fusion algorithm is proposed. The simulation analysis shows that the algorithm can be effectively applied in intelligent information systems.1. IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is an important branch of computer science.

"applied in intelligent information systems.1. IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is an important branch of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. The research in this field includes robot, language recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and expert system. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like people and may exceed human intelligence. It is also considered as one of the three cutting-edge technologies in the 21st century. In the past few years, some computer systems with artificial intelligence have been established to control spacecraft and underwater robots [1]. Through the program, people can make some thinking reasoning, so that they have certain advanced intelligences such as environmental adaptation, automatic learning, and automatic decision-making [2]. In addition to the application of artificial intelligence to sensory simulation, a more important application is to simulate the thinking and analysis process of the human brain, namely, game and logical reasoning, the application of information sensing, and processing. In games or simulation systems, the application of such artificial intelligence is extraordinarily rich. Some techniques, applied in the chess program, such as looking"
