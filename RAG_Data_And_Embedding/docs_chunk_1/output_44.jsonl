"colleges, people often ignore a theoretical premise, which is the thinking on human nature. Workers engaged in management in enterprises or other fields unconsciously apply the theories of \"human nature is good,\" \"human nature is evil,\" \"economic man hypothesis,\" and \"moral man hypothesis\" in management practice. In student management, the theory of human nature should also be analyzed first, because students, as individuals, have natural and social attributes of human beings [5]. Because today's world is in a rapidly changing information age, values and concepts are diversified, and social phenomena are complex. Individuals are not equally influenced by nature and society. The acceptance and understanding of quantitative management, and the effective implementation of quantitative management, require consideration of human assumptions. If the human nature is set to be good, it will often be overlooked in the quantitative management of students. Human interference in quantitative management will make quantitative management lose its fairness and credibility. This situation is precisely the concept that is generally accepted by school administrators. An important reason for questioning the impartiality of [6]. Following the research results of the human nature hypothesis of management, in student management, many schools put forward the concept of \"people-oriented\" and \"life-oriented.\" However, the implicit assumption of this concept is more based on the belief that human"
"research results of the human nature hypothesis of management, in student management, many schools put forward the concept of \"people-oriented\" and \"life-oriented.\" However, the implicit assumption of this concept is more based on the belief that human nature is inherently good, and it is difficult to truly effectively address student anomie behavior. However, if it is assumed that human nature is evil and the content of quantitative management is difficult to reflect complex specific situations and specific problems, it often simplifies the implementation of management, resulting in general resistance to management, making management ineffective or even out of control [7]. Unconditional abstract metaphysical assumptions of good and evil human nature are difficult to support quantitative management. Based on this, this paper first conducts an in-depth analysis of the theoretical development and achievements of the hypothesis of good and evil in human nature and then combines the special background and life development stage of students in private colleges and universities to put forward a reasonable judgment of human nature to provide theoretical support for the formulation and implementation of quantitative management [8].The emergence and development of private colleges and universities is to meet the actual needs of the society and students, but in the process of their work development and progress, due to their limited strength and level, teachers and related managers do"
"emergence and development of private colleges and universities is to meet the actual needs of the society and students, but in the process of their work development and progress, due to their limited strength and level, teachers and related managers do not have enough energy to pay attention to student management work effectiveness. For the management of students in private schools, not only the attention of leaders and managers is required but also the cooperation of students. From the perspective of management, the implementation of a system and concept needs to be implemented from the top down or from the bottom up, so as to truly achieve the purpose of effective management [9]. For managers, if they can get a certain sense of achievement or superiority from effective management, they can better stimulate their enthusiasm for work and innovation. Therefore, within the school, the staff in charge of student management can be praised or encouraged in terms of work promotion and funding according to their achievements. However, from the current management of many private schools, they only formulate rules and regulations to require subordinates to implement them. Such an unclear division of labor and specific responsibilities will cause confusion in the management system and superficial regulations [10]. Due to the incompleteness of the previous management system or work, it is difficult for workers and students to change their habits, so the management work with students as"
"will cause confusion in the management system and superficial regulations [10]. Due to the incompleteness of the previous management system or work, it is difficult for workers and students to change their habits, so the management work with students as the main body and really close to the needs of students should be carried out step by step [11]. However, many managers cannot make students truly understand the importance of self-management and restraint, nor can they communicate with students and understand their actual needs through managers, and they will not clarify the standards of reward and punishment for different behaviors among students. Such nonstaged and hierarchical management cannot really stimulate the enthusiasm of teachers and students to work and study and also cannot establish the effectiveness of self-management and promotion [12].Judging from the current scale and number of students in colleges and universities, if teachers only manage students mechanically, it will not only increase the workload of teachers and cause their academic research to fail to achieve the desired effect but also cannot really achieve the desired results. Facilitate comprehensive management of student work. Because students in colleges and universities already have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, they already have the awareness of independent thinking and making appropriate choices when encountering difficulties and tasks, so the development of student management"
"colleges and universities already have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, they already have the awareness of independent thinking and making appropriate choices when encountering difficulties and tasks, so the development of student management can also be partially handed over to students [13]. In addition, because students already have the ability to be independent, the dogmatic content and system can no longer meet the needs of students, so the work of student management still needs to be regulated and constrained by people. To truly improve the effectiveness of student management work, it is necessary to construct the student management team accordingly.From the perspective of the management of private colleges and universities, managers should keep pace with the times, fully understand the times and the actual needs of students, and manage students with scientific concepts. First, administrators should always insist on students as the center of management. This also shows that managers should fully understand the actual needs of each student and respect their personality development, so as to be truly student-oriented [14]. Second, managers should establish a democratization concept. This philosophy suggests that administrators should take the actual needs of students into account when making decisions and making development plans and can learn about them by interacting with students. When the interests of the students are involved, the administrators should"
"that administrators should take the actual needs of students into account when making decisions and making development plans and can learn about them by interacting with students. When the interests of the students are involved, the administrators should fully listen to the opinions of the students. Only in this atmosphere can the students truly feel the joy of democracy and truly implement the concepts of democracy and equality. Therefore, under the guidance of this student-oriented and democratized concept, students can develop better [15].Management methods and models will directly affect the effect of work, so schools should consciously strengthen the construction of management systems. According to the size of the school, the characteristics of teachers and students, and the management methods of other schools, we will improve the system of our school. This perfect process is not a simple imitation, but to fully reflect the school's purpose and characteristics, so that teachers and students can achieve targeted management and development [16]. Of course, because counselors in colleges and universities have multiple roles, they also need to constantly communicate with students while carrying out student management work and truly become students' mentors and friends. In addition, many schools currently adopt a straight-line management method. In this hierarchical model, the completion of tasks and orders tends to be more mechanized, which is not conducive to the effective"
"truly become students' mentors and friends. In addition, many schools currently adopt a straight-line management method. In this hierarchical model, the completion of tasks and orders tends to be more mechanized, which is not conducive to the effective development of student management. Therefore, the school can give managers the corresponding autonomy, so as to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the work [17].In order to improve the student management effect of private colleges and universities, this paper combines the geographic information system and WIFI environment to construct the student management system of private colleges and universities.2. System Key TechnologyIn the private college student tracking and positioning management platform, the key technologies used are map matching algorithm, MapInfo-based electronic map development, platform website server implementation, Eclipse-based Android application development, and MFC-based application development. In the following, each part is explained separately in this paper.When performing map matching, it is difficult to determine on which route the students of private colleges and universities must move. The system can only give \"probable movement on a certain route\" or \"unlikely to move on a certain route.\" If the system is required to give a more precise positioning result, a reasonable judgment must be made on this ambiguity.

"route\" or \"unlikely to move on a certain route.\" If the system is required to give a more precise positioning result, a reasonable judgment must be made on this ambiguity. Therefore, this paper adopts a map matching algorithm based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and uses the advantages of fuzzy mathematics in this uncertainty judgment. This paper finds a balance between \"certain\" and \"possible,\" so as to find a matching road section as the current road section for private college students to collect data points according to GPS positioning. A schematic diagram of the algorithm flow is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the process of constructing the algorithm model, the concepts of membership and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation are involved. By using these two, a quantitative evaluation can be made on the fuzzy problem of map matching.2.1. MembershipMembership function is a mathematical tool used to characterize fuzzy sets. At present, the method of determining membership function is not mature, and it is usually used to conduct survey and statistics based on the proposed fuzzy concept. We assume that the fuzzy setAdetermines the degree to which different elements belong toAthrough statistical experiments. The membership function is defined as shown in(1)Many experiments have proved that with the increase ofN, the degree of membership tends to be stable, and the stable value is called the degree of membership ofμ0toA.2.2.

"The membership function is defined as shown in(1)Many experiments have proved that with the increase ofN, the degree of membership tends to be stable, and the stable value is called the degree of membership ofμ0toA.2.2. Fuzzy Comprehensive EvaluationThe fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is a comprehensive evaluation method based on fuzzy mathematics. It can better solve many ambiguity problems in the real world. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is to transform qualitative evaluation into quantitative evaluation according to the membership degree theory of fuzzy mathematics, that is, to use fuzzy mathematics to make an overall evaluation of things or objects that are restricted by various factors.When the line is a double line, the derivation model of the map matching algorithm based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established as follows:(1)The algorithm determines the factor setU= {D,A}, whereDrepresents the shortest distance from the GPS positioning collection point to the road sectionD≥ 0 andArepresents the angle between the movement direction of the GPS positioning collection point and the road section orientation 0°≤A≤ 180°(2)The algorithm determines that the evaluation setV= {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5}, wherevnis the evaluation conclusion level, which represents very small, small, medium, large, and very large. The value ofvnrepresents the weight of each level, respectively. Since the influence of factorsDandAis smaller, the map matching can be closer to the true"
"the evaluation conclusion level, which represents very small, small, medium, large, and very large. The value ofvnrepresents the weight of each level, respectively. Since the influence of factorsDandAis smaller, the map matching can be closer to the true value. Therefore,v1>v2>v3>v4>v5, anddis assigned as 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 in the research(3)The algorithm performs the membership determination from the factor set to the judgment setThe evaluation result of each factor is shown in(2)Then, the membership degree matrixRis shown in(3)The closer the membership function is to 1, the higher the degree to which a factor is closer to a certain judgment level. The triangular membership function is used here to make decisions. The scale of the triangular membership function is close to people's actual thinking, improves the accuracy of judgment, and can accurately prioritize and sort programs and is widely used in engineering applications.The membership function of the factorDbelonging to theVjudgment set is shown in equations (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8).YD1(D) ~YD5(D) corresponds tor11~r15, which, respectively, represent the degree to which elementDbelongs to each review conclusion level. Since the official positioning accuracy of GPS is within 0~15 meters, the value ofDis generally within 15 meters, that is, 4d= 15 meters, whered= 3.75 meters.(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)The membership function curve of factorDis shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe membership function of the"

Since the angle between the course and the orientation of the road section is generally relatively small during the movement of students in private colleges and universities, the value ofAis generally concentrated within 60 degrees, that is, 4a= 60 degrees, wherea= 15 degrees.(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)The membership function curve of factorAis shown in Figure3.(4)The algorithm determines the weight vectora= [a1a2] of the factor setU.a1represents the proportion ofDin the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, anda2represents the proportion ofAin the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. In the research, it is considered that the weight of the distance from the positioning point to the line should be larger than that of the orientation of the positioning point, so the values area1= 0.7 anda2= 0.3(5)The algorithm determines the comprehensive membership degree vector. The determination of the comprehensive evaluation vector is the result of the comprehensive evaluation setV, the weight vectoraand the membership matrixR."
"values area1= 0.7 anda2= 0.3(5)The algorithm determines the comprehensive membership degree vector. The determination of the comprehensive evaluation vector is the result of the comprehensive evaluation setV, the weight vectoraand the membership matrixR. Therefore, the index of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is obtained as shown in(14)Open in figure viewerPowerPointAfter substitutingV,A, andR, a relatively simple formula can be obtained as shown in(15)It can be known from the above formula that as long as theDandAfrom the location collection point to the road segment can be obtained in real time, the result curve of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation during this period can be obtained, and then, the selection of the optimal matching road segment relative to the collection point can be completed.After finding the optimal matching road section based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, it is also necessary to correspond the positioning collection points to the line to complete the map matching.When the optimal matching line is determined or the line is a single line, the direction of the private college students' running is defined as theXdirection, and the direction of the vertical line is theYdirection. The algorithm model diagram in theYdirection is shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointWe assume that the running position of students in private colleges is pointAat a certain moment, and the GPS positioning collection pointB(XB,YB) point, pointCis the"

The straight line where theOPis located is an analog line, and the coordinate values of point 0 and pointPare also known. Because |AB| >AC|, we use pointCto locate pointAto reduce the error.TheOP's equation is shown in(16)Since lineBCis perpendicular toOP, the equation for lineBCis shown in(17)By combining formulas (5) and (6), the coordinates of pointCcan be obtained as shown in(18)Among them, (YP−YO)/(XP−XO) =K1, and (XP−XO)/(YP−YO) =K2.In theXdirection, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to determine the most probableXposition on the line. The derivation of the algorithm model is established as follows:(1)The algorithm divides 5 possible sectionsV= {0,v/2,v, 3v/2, 2v} according to the historical speed(2)The algorithm uses the existing positionLand historical data to determine the degree to which the existing position belongs to the running speed. The triangular membership function that is close to the actual thinking of people is also used for scaling. Since the kilometer mark is set at each kilometer from the starting point of the line, here the kilometer mark is used as the benchmark, that is, 4l= 1 km, wherel= 250 m. The membership functions are shown in formulas (19), (20),"

However, for the selection of the optimal section on the single-track line in the study, the weight of the instantaneous velocity and the displacement is equivalent. Therefore, the value isa1=a2= 0.5, or the weight vector can be ignored here(4)The algorithm determines the comprehensive membership degree vector. The obtained index of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is shown in(24)It can also be concluded that as long as the speed and displacement of the positioning collection point can be obtained in real time, the result curve of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation during this period can be obtained, and then, the most probable positionKin theXdirection can be obtained.In this way, pointCon the line is obtained by orthogonal straight line projection in theYdirection, and pointKis the most likely matching point obtained by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method in theXdirection.

At the same time, it is necessary to use the face recognition system to register and keep files for students entering and leaving the dormitory and classrooms and use the smart campus system to record all the activities of students on campus. In addition, it is necessary to track the consumption behavior of students in canteens and supermarkets run by schools and accurately assess poor students. In order to improve the effect of student management in private colleges and universities, this paper combines geographic information system and WIFI to construct student management system in private colleges and universities.

This paper aims to design and develop a set of educational management information systems, using mobile edge computing (MEC) technology to combine the IT service environment and cloud computing technology at the edge of the network to improve the computing and performance of the edge network. Storage capacity reduces network operation and service delivery delay, improves user service quality experience, and helps universities improve the efficiency of educational administration management. This paper first discusses the implementation mode and related technologies of educational administration management system, then discussing the demand analysis of each functional module of the system; in the nonfunctional demand analysis part, the system needs to meet the security and performance. According to the function modules included in the system, using the way of running interface screenshot, implementation code,"
"module of the system; in the nonfunctional demand analysis part, the system needs to meet the security and performance. According to the function modules included in the system, using the way of running interface screenshot, implementation code, and flowchart, the paper analyzes the realization process of the function module and also completes the function test of the function module, as well as the performance test of the whole system. The experimental results show that the rule 4 of teaching level evaluation data mining reveals that the support degree of excellent teaching effect is 18% and the confidence degree is 53% in the age of 50-60. Rule 5 shows that the degree of support is 16% and the degree of confidence is 52%. Rule 10 shows that the degree of support for excellent teaching effect is 22% and the confidence level is 71%. The high confidence level of backbone teachers aged 50-60 indicates that the old teachers are more experienced and popular with students, while the young teachers under 30 need to focus on training to help young teachers improve their professional level. From the above data, it can be seen that through the application of mobile edge technology the educational administration system is more efficient in processing and analyzing data in terms of teacher management and teaching level, which once again shows the impact of this network technology on the construction and development of educational administration systems highly feasible.1."

IntroductionThe progress of information technology has a significant impact on the administrative work of colleges and universities. MEC technology can provide a virtual local area network for campus hotspots and high-capacity scenarios. Through business localization and local distribution technology, it can achieve efficient office and internal communication within the campus, thereby providing users with low-cost, high-experience local connections and local business access ability. Through the latest technology tools, it promotes the development of student management towards the direction of networking and digitalization and gradually develops into the consensus of various colleges and universities. Digital campus is the use of computer technology, network technology, communication technology, and scientific and standardized management to integrate and comprehensively digitize all information resources related to teaching, scientific research, management, and life services on the campus to form a unified user management, unified resource management, and unified authority control. At this stage, some colleges and universities in our country have started and strengthened the development of digital campus, vigorously built"
"on the campus to form a unified user management, unified resource management, and unified authority control. At this stage, some colleges and universities in our country have started and strengthened the development of digital campus, vigorously built campus network, improved the hardware equipment required by digital campus, and actively promoted the improvement of the level of educational administration management by introducing or self-developed forms of configuration of educational administration management information system. The current level of digital construction of university educational administration system is still at a relatively low stage. Traditional university educational administration system deals with multifaceted and multiangle data, and the planning system constructed is often chaotic, which is inconvenient for information management. The development of educational administration management information system in colleges and universities has a far-reaching impact on the development of various activities in colleges and universities, which is conducive to promoting the informatization and efficiency of educational administration management, assisting leaders to make decisions, and enabling teachers and students to obtain more comprehensive information related to teaching and scientific research, so as to reduce the burden of administrative workers and effectively improve high efficiency.With the rapid development of Internet, the expansion of information"
"to obtain more comprehensive information related to teaching and scientific research, so as to reduce the burden of administrative workers and effectively improve high efficiency.With the rapid development of Internet, the expansion of information restricts the effect of learning. Xiao Jun designed a personalized recommendation system for educational video based on collaborative filtering recommendation technology. The design of the system is mainly based on collaborative technology and content analysis technology. The system can not only improve the teaching effect, but also improve students′ learning autonomy and make students study efficiently. The system has been applied to the lifelong learning network and achieved remarkable results [1]. Abdulrauf Tosho describes a research related to the conceptual design model, which aims at the design of teaching interface to improve the utilization rate of courseware. It is found that most of the existing courseware applications focus on the needs of a certain goal and most of the courseware contributes too little to the learners. In addition, as a part of usability strategy, using structure, layout, and navigation to improve courseware teaching interface is also a problem for developers. The purpose of this study is to establish an optional teaching interface, which is called courseware teaching interface design (iid4c), as a part of the usability strategy of inclusive education system, for reference of developers and using"
"developers. The purpose of this study is to establish an optional teaching interface, which is called courseware teaching interface design (iid4c), as a part of the usability strategy of inclusive education system, for reference of developers and using comparative analysis technology to determine the elements of the model. Finally, the study found that iid4c model is useful for information access and is helpful for the design of teaching courseware. The future work is to evaluate the proposed model among disabled and nondisabled learners [2]. Roman Yavich, in the framework of prescriptive theory, uses the discipline design method to build a conceptual model of a set of student training methods in the saturated environment of information and communication. This enables them to allocate the stages of designing student training methods when using virtual education environments. The results of this paper reflect the general methods of teacher activity design, including the design of training methods based on the consideration of the main structural components of educational technology. Through the investigation of the characteristics and opportunities of the virtual education environment, we can make clear the rich nature of the training method system and the mechanism of self-adjustment and self-improvement under the education information environment and make a conclusion that it is impossible to create the modern education process without the virtual education environment [3]."
"training method system and the mechanism of self-adjustment and self-improvement under the education information environment and make a conclusion that it is impossible to create the modern education process without the virtual education environment [3]. These three scholars have discussed the closeness of the connection between the network and teaching from different angles. Some people have constructed a new conceptual model of teaching according to the current problems, making full use of virtual technology, etc. However, their research is not comprehensively enough. However, there are still shortcomings in the selection of technology applications, and the processing of data needs to be strengthened.This paper first discusses the overall structure design of the system, including the design of the main function modules, the overall structure chart and the main workflow of the system, the detailed design of the system database, and the overall design of the data mining process of the achievements. Secondly, it discusses the process of mining the teaching level evaluation data to obtain useful information in the mobile educational administration management system. The function test, performance test, usability test, and security test are implemented in the mobile educational administration management system. Adopt B/s and C/s model structure to reduce costs while maximizing benefits and use J2EE technology multilayer model to extend the service architecture; JSP technology"
"test are implemented in the mobile educational administration management system. Adopt B/s and C/s model structure to reduce costs while maximizing benefits and use J2EE technology multilayer model to extend the service architecture; JSP technology provides multiple efficient operation servers for the multiple models in this article. All work arrangements are to create an intelligent educational administration management system.2. The Proposed Method2.1. Implementation Mode of Educational Administration Management SystemMode structure C/s and B/s: C/S structure is client/server structure, which can reduce the communication cost of the system [4]. However, the C/S mode requires the support of the corresponding client of the user host, so the software in this mode needs to develop the corresponding software according to different operating systems, which increases the development cost. At the same time, with the acceleration of software update, the cost of maintaining the software also increases accordingly [5,6]. Therefore, the whole system adopts the B/S (browser/server) mode, which is convenient and efficient in management software.B/S structure is browser and server structure. It is different from the C/S structure, it does not need the user host to install the corresponding client software, and users only need a browser to browse and operate the working interface [7]. Browser almost does not need to implement transaction logic, mostly by the server-side implementation,"
"does not need the user host to install the corresponding client software, and users only need a browser to browse and operate the working interface [7]. Browser almost does not need to implement transaction logic, mostly by the server-side implementation, forming the so-called three-tier architecture. This can reduce the development cost and the overall cost [8].According to the above introduction and analysis, the construction of campus network adopts B/S structure, which can realize the system relatively and simply and reduce the development cost [9]. It can access the database in many ways and protect the security of the data through the authority control. This is also an important reason for using B/S mode [10,11].Advantages of B/S mode are given as follows:(1)The B/S mode turns the client into a browser, through which the user can access the server.(2)B/S mode can be directly placed on the WAN, which is suitable for frequent interaction occasions and easy to be accepted by users.(3)B/S mode only needs to upgrade the server and adapt the browser [12].(4)The development of B/S mode has the advantages of strong sharing and convenient business expansion, and the expansion of web pages can increase the function of no service.(5)The B/S mode can release information on the network, which is exactly what the educational administration management system needs.

"B/S mode can release information on the network, which is exactly what the educational administration management system needs. The written paper documents can be replaced by the electronic documents, which not only save resources, but also are convenient and fast and improves the office efficiency [13,14].2.2. Related Technologies2.2.1. J2EE TechnologyThe full name of J2EE is Java2 Platform Enterprise Edition. Its essence is to provide an application with a Java environment that can run on the server side. It provides the basic framework environment and API for application extension. As J2EE components and service architecture have the same standards and specifications, it provides technical specifications and guidelines for solving the conflicts between various products in the past [15,16].J2EE also solves the shortcomings of the past C/s two-tier mode. By layering, the business logic and interface display are separated, making the software have better scalability [17,18]. At present, J2EE is mainly a typical four-tier model, and the system is developed according to the four-tier structure [19], as shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointJ2EE′s four-layer structure.2.2.2. Servlet TechnologyThe client is actually a browser, which does not need to be developed. JSP technology and Servlet technology are needed in the network layer. Let us introduce Servlet technology [20]. The full name of Servlet is Java Servlet, which is a server-side program written in Java."
"a browser, which does not need to be developed. JSP technology and Servlet technology are needed in the network layer. Let us introduce Servlet technology [20]. The full name of Servlet is Java Servlet, which is a server-side program written in Java. Its essence is the Java program running on the server [21,22]. Servlet is written in Java, so it has powerful functions. It can not only process the client′s request, but also return the response. Because of the combination of these two aspects, it is very suitable to use Servlet in B/S mode [23,24]. In general, it has the advantages of good portability, powerful function, good security, simplicity, high efficiency, and durability [25,26].2.2.3. JSP TechnologyJSP is the abbreviation of JavaServer pages, in fact, it is a simple servlet, and it is a dynamic web page technical standard [27]. It can insert Java language into HTML syntax to make some data judgment or verification [28].As the current web page development technology, JSP has the following characteristics compared with the static HTML pages in the past:(1)Separate the generation and display of content. This can protect the code, and at the same time HTML pages can easily adapt to most browsers.(2)Strong portability: because many platforms support Java, JSP can run on almost any platform.(3)Use JavaBean technology to write every object or business component, and then JSP page can use this object or business component repeatedly.(4)Precompiling is the first time that JSP"
"many platforms support Java, JSP can run on almost any platform.(3)Use JavaBean technology to write every object or business component, and then JSP page can use this object or business component repeatedly.(4)Precompiling is the first time that JSP pages are accessed by users; they need to compile and save the compiled results. After that, when they visit again, they can run the saved compiled results directly instead of precompiling, which can greatly improve the access speed.2.2.4. MVC ModeThe full name of MVC is model view controller It is a three-layer software design model. The application of the MVC pattern in the design of the educational administration system serves as a small skill to propose solutions to specific problems in order to increase the code reuse rate and reduce the degree of coupling. The data information is planned into sange categories through hierarchical levels, which is more specific and more clear. The execution process of data input, processing, and output in program development is handled in a separate way. MVC design pattern is actually to decompose the problem through layers and develop and solve the problem independently. Simplify complex problems and reduce development difficulties and complexity.The architecture and design of the educational administration integrated management platform completely follow the MVC mode, and Java technology is widely used in the actual development.Model: the core of MVC accepts the data of view request and"
"architecture and design of the educational administration integrated management platform completely follow the MVC mode, and Java technology is widely used in the actual development.Model: the core of MVC accepts the data of view request and returns the final processing result. In order to make full use of the existing components, the business model is further divided from the perspective of application technology, but it cannot be used as the framework of application design model. The model in MVC design pattern includes not only business model, but also function model and data model. A model can be reused by multiple views, which improves the efficiency of development and reduces the repetition rate of code.View: it is responsible for providing user interface (UI) to the user. It is a model that hosts the information required by the display controller. The model needs to be transformed and presented to the user. In traditional web applications, view is an interface composed of HTML, and the design is relatively simple. In today′s web applications, view design is more and more complex. One function corresponds to multiple views, through which data is collected and captured. In ASP. Net MVC, view is passed to its controller and modified content to HTML through the model object of state register. Business process processing is done by model.Control: the user receives the request, associates and activates the model and view, and completes the user′s request together. When the"
"and modified content to HTML through the model object of state register. Business process processing is done by model.Control: the user receives the request, associates and activates the model and view, and completes the user′s request together. When the request initiator is activated and triggered, the controller does not operate. Its job is to receive the request and select which model to call to process the request and determine which view to use to display the returned data.The three-tier structure model of MVC design model, the main functions and relations of view, and controller are shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of MVC model.2.2.5. JavaBean TechnologyJavaBean is to implement the software component model in Java language. In the program, these models are all a class. These classes comply with the JavaBean standard and have a unified specification. Standard JavaBean components can be compared with classes, and then these classes can be constructed and applied. Using this technology can make the code easy to maintain, use, and write, also can realize code reuse, and enhance code transmission.2.2.6. Mobile Edge Computing TechnologyMobile edge computing technology provides smart and cloud computing capabilities for wireless access networks by deploying servers on the wireless access side.

"and cloud computing capabilities for wireless access networks by deploying servers on the wireless access side. Among them, the virtualized infrastructure is based on physical resources such as computing and storage of general-purpose servers. It provides a flexible and efficient platform environment for multiple applications to run independently for the application layer. The software functional entities can be used to achieve business localization and close-range processing; mobile edge the platform is responsible for processing the basic functions required by mobile edge applications, including domain name, routing rule management and control, data distribution, wireless network information management, network self-organization management, big data analysis, network acceleration, and business registration functions, of which local distribution is business. The prerequisite for application localization and short-distance deployment is one of the most basic functions of the mobile edge computing platform, so that the wireless network has the ability of transmitting with low latency and high bandwidth. Short-distance deployment is to give full play to the low-latency advantages of mobile edge computing technology. Because the distance to the user is closer, user requests no longer need to travel through a long transmission network to reach the remote core network to be processed but are processed by the local MEC server. Part of the traffic is offloaded, processed directly,"
"distance to the user is closer, user requests no longer need to travel through a long transmission network to reach the remote core network to be processed but are processed by the local MEC server. Part of the traffic is offloaded, processed directly, and responded to the user, so the communication delay will be greatly reduced.2.3. Demand AnalysisRequirement analysis is to understand what functions users want to achieve through software. Requirement analysis needs to understand the user′s requirements in detail, which has the function of decision-making, direction, and strategy. The educational administration management system is mainly to complete the needs of the school educational administration work, including the setting of courses, the storage, and management of basic information such as student status, the admission of students′ scores, and the management of teachers′ basic information, which requires a detailed and comprehensive demand analysis of the school educational administration management process and the design of a good management platform. This section mainly introduces the design principles, data flow, functional requirements, and nonfunctional requirements of the system.2.3.1. Design PrinciplesThe educational administration management system is based on the digital campus.

"educational administration management system is based on the digital campus. In the process of design and development, it needs to follow certain design principles, not only to meet the basic principles of software design, but also to meet the needs of educational administration management, which is the basic requirement of completing the system development with quality and quantity. The following are the design principles followed by the system design:(1)Based on the overall planning, the system is based on the process of educational administration management and the specific functions are implemented step by step.(2)The design structure of the system is simple and easy to maintain; Java programming is used to reduce the difficulty and facilitate future maintenance and update.(3)The system divides users into administrators, teachers, and students, which makes it more convenient to add, delete, modify, and check educational information within their respective authority. So, it is easy to operate and access.(4)Security: the system ensures the security and reliability of data through identity authentication, authority management, and other measures to ensure the normal and reliable operation of the system.2.3.2. Main Workflow of the SystemThe workflow of each user using the function module is as follows:(1)Score entry: this function is a teacher function. After logging in the system through the mobile intelligent terminal, the teacher can choose to enter the score entry page,"
"of the SystemThe workflow of each user using the function module is as follows:(1)Score entry: this function is a teacher function. After logging in the system through the mobile intelligent terminal, the teacher can choose to enter the score entry page, enter the name of the class, the course name, and the teaching time to start the score entry.(2)Schedule query: this function is shared by teachers and students. After the teachers or students log in to the system, select schedule query, enter the query interface, enter the class name to be queried, and enter the class schedule. In case of special circumstances, teachers can view the class schedule through this function and obtain the free time of the class according to the schedule display. In addition, teachers can also query the individual schedule according to the work number.(3)Classroom inquiry and reservation: this function is a teacher function. After the teacher logs in to the system, he/she selects the classroom inquiry and reservation, enters the inquiry interface, enters the use time, and selects the classroom type, and then he/she will view the relevant information of the idle classroom, including the classroom name and the number of seats. The teacher selects the required classroom according to the number of required classes and the nature of the course. When booking the classroom, the teacher enters the name of the teacher, the name of the class, the time of class, and the name of the course and selects the"
"the required classroom according to the number of required classes and the nature of the course. When booking the classroom, the teacher enters the name of the teacher, the name of the class, the time of class, and the name of the course and selects the reservation. The reservation information will be submitted to the server.(4)Course transfer application: this is the function of teachers. After the teacher has reserved the classroom, select the class adjustment application to enter the class adjustment application interface and select the class adjustment type, including two types of options, class adjustment and arrangement due to curriculum design, then enter the name of the teacher, the name of the teaching class, and the name of the course, and finally select the class adjustment scheme. There are two kinds of course adjustment schemes. One is that the teacher adjusts the time and place of class: input the original week, day of week, and time of class, adjust the week, day of week, and the name of the scheduled classroom, and then submit the application for class adjustment; the other is that the teacher adjusts the teaching without changing the time and place of class: input the week, day of week, time of class, and the name of the substitute teacher and then submit the application for class adjustment. Because the front part of the application content is the same, the system design will display two kinds of course adjustment schemes in the same page.(5)User"
"and the name of the substitute teacher and then submit the application for class adjustment. Because the front part of the application content is the same, the system design will display two kinds of course adjustment schemes in the same page.(5)User management: this function is an administrator function. After the administrator logs in to the background system, he/she selects and enters the user management page. For three different types of users, the administrator can add, delete, or modify users by category and assign permissions and modify passwords to users.(6)Course management: this function is an administrator function. The administrator can log in to the system and enter the curriculum management interface to create course information, add and modify courses, classify courses, and complete course arrangement.(7)Classroom management: this function is an administrator function. After the administrator logs in to the system, he/she will enter the classroom management interface. Classroom management includes three submodules, input classroom, classroom classification, and classroom reservation management. The administrator can enter the classroom classification module to classify the existing classrooms according to the two categories of used and free; mark the arranged and scheduled classrooms as used and other free classrooms for teachers to query and book. The administrator can enter the classroom reservation management module to count, mark, and delete the"
"to the two categories of used and free; mark the arranged and scheduled classrooms as used and other free classrooms for teachers to query and book. The administrator can enter the classroom reservation management module to count, mark, and delete the reservation information.(8)Notice management: administrators can add, publish, and delete announcements after entering the announcement management function interface.(9)Performance management: teachers input students′ scores into the database according to the subjects and class names they teach; administrators add, delete and modify the scores, and manage the scores of each student according to the class; that is to say, connect and query the scores of each subject in the class according to the student number and name to generate a new class score table. The administrator makes statistics and analysis on the scores of each subject, and the score table can be directly called by the score association rule mining subsystem. The first stage of association rule mining must find all high-frequency item groups of student performance divided by subject and class from the original data collection. Use the high-frequency k-item group in the previous step to generate rules and perform calculations, sorting, and classification under the threshold of the minimum reliability condition.(10)Student status management: the administrator manages the student′s student status information, including inputting the basic information of the student′s"

Experiments3.1. Database DesignIn the conceptual structure design stage, this paper uses the total E-R diagram of the system to describe the relationship between the entities involved in the database. It is represented by an ellipse in the E-R diagram, and entities with the same attributes have the same characteristics and properties. The entity name and its attribute name set are used to abstract and characterize similar entities and use undirected edges to connect them with corresponding entities; for example, the student′s name, student ID, and gender are all attributes. If it is a multivalue attribute, put a solid ellipse outside the ellipse. In the logical structure design stage, this paper transforms the E-R diagram into a relational model and finally designs the table structure of the database.

Based on the theory of conceptual structure design of database, this paper analyzes the demand of educational administration management system and abstracts the entity of this mobile educational administration management system, which mainly includes users, departments, classes, students, teachers, courses, grades, classrooms, announcements, and class transfer applications. After induction and analysis, E-R model related to administrators and E-R model related to students are, respectively, obtained.

System TestBefore the mobile educational administration management system is put into use, it needs to test the system performance according to a variety of test indicators to check whether the system can operate normally. Because of the use of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and other popular but not very mature front-end development technologies, the openness required by HTML5 technology is not up to standard, and the standards of related technologies are not yet mature; CSS3 needs to be drawn and cut from the beginning to achieve, and the follow-up workload is large; jQuery is based on the data cache module to manage events, and the style operation module is used to obtain calculations style or set inline style. The system may produce many unexpected problems in the use process, so we must test the system functions in multiple directions and find out the system defects as much as possible, The main focus of the test of the educational administration management system based on the mobile Internet is whether the system can work well in different browser environments. The purpose of this system test is to verify whether the system meets the user′s requirements and complies with the system design requirements, including development test, integration test, and acceptance test. System test is to test the usability, operation efficiency, and data integrity"
"to verify whether the system meets the user′s requirements and complies with the system design requirements, including development test, integration test, and acceptance test. System test is to test the usability, operation efficiency, and data integrity of the system by using test tools according to the test process. The system test includes function test, performance test, usability test, and security test.4. Discussion4.1. Design and Implementation4.1.1. Design and Implementation of Login and Verification ModuleIn this design, the system security measures are taken to encrypt the user′s login password. After the client is encrypted, the input login password needs to be compared with the secondary encryption password stored in the server before normal access to the system. In fact, the user′s use of the system is not different from the original, but it really enhances the security performance of the system. In this way, it also means that two levels need to be passed before the visit on the one hand for the user and on the other hand for the system. First, the user′s identity is determined, and then the database is checked.After the user enters the user name (user account) and password and verification code on the login page, the server first determines whether the verification code is correct and then determines whether there is a value matching the user′s input account in the database user table. If there is a user account in the database, the system will compare the"
"page, the server first determines whether the verification code is correct and then determines whether there is a value matching the user′s input account in the database user table. If there is a user account in the database, the system will compare the password field corresponding to the account with the secondary encryption submitted in the form (twice via the client and server MD5 encrypted) password. If the comparison is consistent, you can successfully enter the user operation page corresponding to the type of user account entered; otherwise, it will stay on the login and verification page. The effect of the system login page is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointRendering of system login page.4.1.2. Design and Implementation of Student Status Management ModuleFor the management of student status after leaving school or leaving school, this graduation design sets different query conditions for student status information according to the two situations of leaving school. The student status information of leaving school can be deleted by selectively inputting grade to query all student status information; and the student status information of individual dropping out can be queried by inputting student number to query relevant student status. The information is then deleted. The interface of query management is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointDeparture management interface.4.1.3.

Design and Implementation of Announcement Management ModuleAfter the administrator enters the page of creating the announcement, the system can set the time of creating and publishing the announcement through the new attribute date time marked by HTML5 < input >. In the drop-down list, the identity of the publisher can be selected. After entering the title and the content of the announcement, the creation of the announcement is completed. The Modify button in the page plays the role of resetting the content of the announcement. Click the Publish button to publish the announcement to teachers and students. The page effect of creating an announcement is shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointEffect of creating announcement page.The key technology to realize the notification management is to send the page. The application of this function is embodied in adding a multilayer background image to an element. The filtered data is scaled by a specified multiple, a simple block is split into multiple columns, and the number of columns, column widths, and blank spaces between columns is realized through corresponding attributes. The application of this attribute has greatly improved the problem of multilayer layout in the past in the face of multilayer design."
"and the number of columns, column widths, and blank spaces between columns is realized through corresponding attributes. The application of this attribute has greatly improved the problem of multilayer layout in the past in the face of multilayer design. This system calls the class SMS interface provided by CSS3 to realize the sending function. The main functions include the following: mobilelnfo service is used to realize the session connection with the mobile client. CSS3′s API calls sendsms (string telnumber. Stringmsg), a function of public void type, to send page information. The function setstratus() of type public void is used to record the sending status; 0 is failed; 1 is sent successfully.4.2. Implementation of Data Mining for Teaching Level EvaluationThe average score of basic computer score is extracted from the student score table of the mobile educational administration management system database as the data voucher to evaluate the teaching effect of teachers.

Using layer-by-layer search and iteration method, the core idea is to mine frequent itemsets through two stages: candidate set generation and plot downward closed detection. Its core is a recursive algorithm based on the two-stage frequency set idea. After the data preparation, the association rules in apriori algorithm can be used to mine the relationship among teachers′ age, professional title, education background, and classroom teaching effect for the selected teaching effect information with excellent teaching effect (teaching effect grade 3).

Rule 10 shows that the degree of support for excellent teaching effect is 22% and the confidence level is 71%.From the above rules, it can be concluded that, for subjects with excellent teaching effect, the relationship between teaching effect and age, professional title, and education background is as follows: young and middle-aged teachers in the 30-50 age group have relatively high degree of support and confidence in teaching effect, indicating that they have relatively rich classroom teaching experience. The high confidence level of backbone teachers aged 50-60 indicates that the old teachers are more experienced and popular with students, while the young teachers under 30 need to focus on training to help young teachers improve their professional level.

ConclusionsThe vigorous development of mobile edge computing has created a good foundation for the wide application of management information system. The management information system based on B/S mode is bound to develop into one of the main branches of information management. To improve and upgrade the traditional system, it is the inevitable choice for colleges and universities to further strengthen the educational administration management. The management system based on B/S mode appears under the condition of high popularity of mobile edge computing and increasingly mature application of database. Compared with the traditional C/S (client/server) mode, it is more perfect and advanced and can well adapt to the new requirements of information management in the Internet era.This paper studies the"

"AbstractHumanitarian medical organizations rely on information on and from the ground to evaluate their effectiveness and accountability. Related digitalization efforts within health information systems assume an instrumental rationality in the use of data. However, previous research identified a multitude of factors influencing actual information use for evidence-based decision-making for healthcare delivery. This case study, anchored by critical realism philosophy, unpacks these nuances against the backdrop of a globally operating organization (Medecins Sans Frontières). It aims to highlight the contextual conditions and structures that enact the contingent mechanisms at work in project monitoring within humanitarian health management information systems. By applying an affordance-based causal analysis, three mechanisms are identified: first, an analytics service provides templated analysis modalities resulting in user-producer-provider relationships; second, the rationalization and synchronization of content and software artifacts gives rise to the standardization strategy of flexible generification; third, the study uncovers the potential for increased internal social discourse and advocacy through collaborative and mobile data analysis. This paper proposes that mechanism-based explanations can be useful for theory-building in information systems research as well as for providing insights to practitioners in the humanitarian health sector.Armed conflicts, epidemics,"
"mobile data analysis. This paper proposes that mechanism-based explanations can be useful for theory-building in information systems research as well as for providing insights to practitioners in the humanitarian health sector.Armed conflicts, epidemics, natural disasters and other humanitarian crises are inherently complex, protracted situations that lead to large numbers of refugees, internally displaced and entrapped persons. In these situations, humanitarian short-term emergency responses often evolve into long-term interventions (Spiegel,2017; Vila-Pozo & Sahay,2018). Organizations providing aid in these complex contexts are expected to demonstrate their effectiveness and accountability to the donors and the recipients of aid. The organization's information system (IS) is a critical tool in fulfilling this demand (Lewis & Madon,2004; Read et al.,2016), as information and communication technologies (ICTs), when embedded in a broader view of technological, social and institutional innovations, are considered a catalyst for improved health outcomes (Walsham,2020). However, a 2018 review of a sector-wide network of humanitarian organizations concluded that despite efforts of information collection for impact and outcome monitoring, as well as the attempts to design more adaptable and context-specific programs, substantial improvements have not yet occurred (Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance [ALNAP],2018).

"monitoring, as well as the attempts to design more adaptable and context-specific programs, substantial improvements have not yet occurred (Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance [ALNAP],2018). Reasons include the complex settings in which health technologies are deployed and disseminated (Mesmar et al.,2016), which are characterized by factors such as intermittent or expensive connectivity, unsafe environments and the need to handle highly sensitive data.The central role of ICTs as a decision-making tool in humanitarian aid is relatively new. An ongoing paradigm shift is suggested to be taking place in international development towards a \"digital nervous system\" permeating most development organizations: \"the iconic technology is now the digital platform, the key goals are the SDGs [the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals], and the key issue is now impact alone.\" (Heeks,2020). Humanitarian actors, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) increasingly use information from health management information systems (HMIS) for their reporting (Braa & Sahay,2017). HMIS store routinely collected and aggregated healthcare data and indicators (Dixon & Grannis,2020), which are employed as surveillance or monitoring systems in order to guide interventions in real time (Mesmar et al.,2016).Previous research on HMIS has identified various interconnected organizational, technical and behavioral factors that play a role in the use of information for"
"or monitoring systems in order to guide interventions in real time (Mesmar et al.,2016).Previous research on HMIS has identified various interconnected organizational, technical and behavioral factors that play a role in the use of information for evidence-based decision-making, such as data quality and availability, individual capabilities and governance (Aqil et al.,2009; Nutley & Reynolds,2013). Individual data literacy as well as the \"information culture\" of organizations are supporting or determinant factors for effective decision-making (Aqil et al.,2009; Kumar et al.,2018; Penn & Dent,2016). Vila-Pozo and Sahay (2019) identified three elements of decision-making by humanitarian medical organizations using data for project monitoring and surveillance: (a) operationability (use data to follow-up trends and identify alerts for constant response and adaptation of activities); (b) accountability (use data to be accountable for day-to-day activities and operational decisions); and (c) contextuability (use data to know and analyze the context when you are new to the situation). However, factors related to system design such as user involvement, work flow or human-computer interaction are in general still underexplored (Kumar et al.,2018).

"et al.,2018). This study aims to contribute to this research area by elaborating on the structures and conditions of information use mediated through humanitarian health management information systems (HHMIS) within the context of project monitoring.The study is therefore guided by the following research question:which generative mechanisms contingently lead to effective use of information for project monitoring in international humanitarian medical organizations?It draws on literature from ICT4D (information and communication technology for development) and health information systems (HIS) disciplines as well as on the philosophy of critical realism to describe the contingent conditions and structures of mechanisms related to information use in a case study of the HHMIS of a globally active non-governmental organization.This paper provides insights for humanitarian health practitioners involved with digitalization initiatives as well as a theoretical contribution to the methodological practices of the critical realist philosophy underpinning this study. It proceeds by providing the philosophical and theoretical foundations in the research methodology section, followed by descriptions of the method, setting and case. The identified mechanisms are presented in the findings section, followed by the discussion, practical implications and conclusions.1 RESEARCH METHODOLOGYThe multitude of identified factors of information use in health information systems precludes the isolation"
"mechanisms are presented in the findings section, followed by the discussion, practical implications and conclusions.1 RESEARCH METHODOLOGYThe multitude of identified factors of information use in health information systems precludes the isolation of one phenomenon in a controlled study, as a force outside of the constrained environment can be a non-negligible influence on the phenomenon under consideration. In an open system, we must assume a dynamic and variable reality that is influenced by technological, social, organizational and environmental factors, and it is necessary to analyze the causality of a certain phenomenon--information use--in order to improve it for increased effectiveness.1.1 Critical realismCritical realism (CR) has emerged as a new (by philosophical standards) and legitimate alternative to positivist and interpretive approaches to IS research in the past two decades (Mingers et al.,2013; Tsang,2014; Wynn & Williams,2012,2020). Initially, the philosophy of CR was formulated by the British philosopher Roy Bhaskar in the 1970s (Bhaskar,2008) and extended by Bhaskar himself as well as Sayer (2010) and others in the 1990s. As a philosophy of science, it includes specifications about its ontology (assumptions about the existence of the world and society) and its epistemology (the study of how knowledge is possible).Even though there is no unifying framework, three core assumptions underlie the philosophy. Ontological realism argues that reality is"
"(assumptions about the existence of the world and society) and its epistemology (the study of how knowledge is possible).Even though there is no unifying framework, three core assumptions underlie the philosophy. Ontological realism argues that reality is independent of our perception and knowledge. Epistemic relativism states that our knowledge of this world is limited, fallible and contextual. Judgemental rationality refers to the commitment to the rational evaluation of the diverse and sometimes conflicting theories about the world. This rationality is (a) enabled by independent reality, and (b) necessitated by the relativity of our knowledge: if reality is intransitive and independent, and we only have fallible theories in our own transitive reality, there must be a rational judgment on the plurality of assertions of this world for science to be possible.Adhering to these principles, a stratification of reality in three nested domains is specified (visualized in Figure1). The real consists of physical and social structures (such as organizations, norms, cultures) and mechanisms, which may (or may not) generate events in the second domain (of the actual), which states what must have occurred even though it might not be (possible to be) empirically perceived. In the third domain (the empirical), these events may be observed or experienced. In that sense, structures have the potential to enable or constrain events through generative mechanisms which are \"nothing other than"
"to be) empirically perceived. In the third domain (the empirical), these events may be observed or experienced. In that sense, structures have the potential to enable or constrain events through generative mechanisms which are \"nothing other than the ways of acting of things\" (Bhaskar,2008) (the definition of a CR-based mechanism has been repeatedly refined, see Wynn and Williams (2020)). The intransitive dimension of a reality consisting of structures, mechanisms and processes exists independently from our knowledge in the transitive dimension. CR states that knowledge of the world is emergent, political and imperfect; Bhaskar termed the mix of these two the \"epistemic fallacy,\" the essential mistake of reducing the ontological domain of existence to the epistemological domain of knowledge, so that statements about our existence are constructed or modulated by our knowledge of being (Mingers et al.,2013). What follows is that critical realist researchers do not have immediate access to the intransitive dimension, but that they reason about reality (the structure and mechanisms) through abstract causal analysis of concrete events generated by mechanisms in order to create knowledge within the transitive dimension. \"Concrete research studies actual events and objects as 'unities of diverse determinations', each of which has been isolated and examined through abstract research\" (Sayer,2010).FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointStratification of reality in critical realism"
"research studies actual events and objects as 'unities of diverse determinations', each of which has been isolated and examined through abstract research\" (Sayer,2010).FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointStratification of reality in critical realism (adapted from Bhaskar,2008)Empirical or actual events can be created or canceled by a single or multiple mechanisms, and structures can generate one or multiple mechanisms. These descriptions of dependencies and emergence are visualized in Figure2.FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructures, mechanisms, events (adapted from Sayer,2010, Figure8)The main two reasoning methods for causal analysis are retroduction (identifying new mechanisms based on the metaphorical application of prior knowledge) and retrodiction or abduction (the application of existing theory or known mechanisms to explain different phenomena) (Wynn & Williams,2012). Mechanisms do not imply a linear causality that produce the same outcome every time it is generated. Instead, mechanisms are contextual and dependent on other mechanisms.As an IS-related discipline, ICT4D is suitable for CR-based research approaches (cf. Buchana et al.,2018; Gebre-Mariam & Bygstad,2019; Njihia & Merali,2013; Thapa & Omland,2018). More broadly, critical research has been used in various ICT4D studies as well (De' et al.,2018; Poveda & Roberts,2018; Singh et al.,2018).

"More broadly, critical research has been used in various ICT4D studies as well (De' et al.,2018; Poveda & Roberts,2018; Singh et al.,2018). CR-based ICT4D research makes use of an \"iterative, pluralist and reflexive methodology with emancipatory values\" (Heeks & Wall,2017). It forces an involvement with the ICT4D context based on what exists--local expertise, needs and adaptive capabilities--and how it evolved over time, rather than perceiving development as what is lacking (Njihia & Merali,2013). Identified generative mechanisms can further be tested and used in action research (Bygstad et al.,2016) as a basis for strengthening the exchange between theory and practice, a direction that is in need of further examination in critical ICT4D research (Bon & Akkermans,2019).1.2 Affordance theoryIn order to identify generative mechanisms, it is required to identify potential and actual capabilities of entities, a task that invites the introduction of the concept of affordances. An affordance is an \"action possibility available in the environment\" independent of individuals' ability to recognize them. The term has its origin in ecological psychology (Gibson,1979). IS scholars adopted affordances as a lens for the study of the limits and possibilities of relationships between actors and technologies because they do not determine how actors use a technology while still limiting the number of potential uses (Stendal et al.,2016). At the same time, \"there is no one way to adopt the"
"and possibilities of relationships between actors and technologies because they do not determine how actors use a technology while still limiting the number of potential uses (Stendal et al.,2016). At the same time, \"there is no one way to adopt the affordance lens\" in IS research; however, affordances commonly contain \"objects with properties,\" \"actors with goals,\" \"action possibilities\" and \"actor capabilities\" (Stendal et al.,2016). This study adopts the stance of potential affordances as categorized by Lanamäki et al. (2016) and thus considers affordances as \"the potential for behaviors associated with achieving an immediate concrete outcome and arising from the relation between an object (e.g., an IT artefact) and a goal-oriented actor or actors\" (Volkoff & Strong,2013) because IT artifacts--in this case a HMIS--are flexible by nature (Bygstad et al.,2016; Leonardi,2011; Nicholson et al.,2019), and their related organizational change processes not predetermined (Orlikowski,1996). The notion of affordances as a tool for unpacking the interdependency of human agency and material structures of IT artifacts that is neither technologically nor socially deterministic (Leonardi,2011; Volkoff & Strong,2013) can be mapped to the CR-based domain of the real.Additionally, the lack of specific inclusion of technological artifacts in CR-based IS research requires a more ICT-specific integration as affordances can link specific IS and ICT directly to actors and, in doing so, describe"
"CR-based domain of the real.Additionally, the lack of specific inclusion of technological artifacts in CR-based IS research requires a more ICT-specific integration as affordances can link specific IS and ICT directly to actors and, in doing so, describe their inherent capabilities and limitations (Bygstad et al.,2016). As potentialities of action related to IT artifacts are methodologically easier identified than whole mechanisms, affordances here are regarded as building blocks of mechanisms (Volkoff & Strong,2013; Wynn & Williams,2020). The specificity of the potential of action tied to a methodological guidance mapping actors to ICT is absent in other CR-based methodologies such as found in Thapa and Omland (2018) or Wynn and Williams (2012).Thus, legitimate and practical value is seen in adopting the affordance-based theoretical foundation that guides the research method of this study.2 RESEARCH METHOD AND SETTINGTo answer the research question, the research approach presents an in-depth case study of the digitalization efforts to establish a web-based online platform for monitoring and surveillance in three sub-organizations (Operational Centers, or OCs) of an international humanitarian medical organization.

"The unit of analysis are practitioners of digital health within the organization, namely managers, advisors, users and researchers of the platform in order to gather a wide array of viewpoints. A case study was chosen as it is \"an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real life context when the boundaries are not clearly evident and in which multiple sources of evidence are used\" (Yin,2018). Critical realism is well suited to conduct case studies (Tsang,2014; Wynn & Williams,2012) and thus a fitting method for addressing the research question.2.1 Data collectionData collection was conducted iteratively and involved five semi-structured interviews with six interviewees. Table1lists the details of the interviews. The first interview was conducted with two participants to get a broader initial picture of the organization. The number of interviews was determined by the evidence saturation (Glaser & Strauss,1967) of the affordances and mechanisms theorized. The semi-structured format of the interviews was chosen due to having an initial frame of reference pertinent to the research question that still allowed new ideas to emerge. The participants were identified with the help of a purposive sampling strategy based on their involvement with the organization's HIS.TABLE  1.Interviewees and interview durationNamePositionOCDurationInterviewee 1 (INT1)Program manager150 minInterviewee 2 (INT2)eHealth epidemiologist1Interviewee 3 (INT3)Humanitarian HIS"

The COVID-19 pandemic further prescribed remote communications and limited the availability of medical personnel.The interview protocols were iteratively adapted for each new interview. The related interview guide, which provided the starting point for the interviews, is attached in the Appendix A.

Additionally, empirical research published in the literature about the same organization's IS such as from Vila-Pozo and Sahay (2018,2019) as well as from field research (Medecins Sans Frontières,n.d.-a) were included in order to broaden the research-based perspective.

Each participant's associated OC has been anonymized (see Table1) to protect the identity of the interviewees. Appropriate protection measures were implemented for the storage of data such as encrypted hard drives and password-protected folders.2.2 Data analysis frameworkOn the basis of affordances embedded in a critical realism underpinning, the framework of Bygstad et al. (2016) for critical realist data analysis fits well because it provides methodological guidance to construct and subsequently test mechanisms. Its strength lies in its pragmatism in reasoning about causality in IS by mediating and constructing the abstract CR concepts with more tangible affordances. The structure of the framework is outlined below as well as depicted in Figure3.Description of events and issues (clusters of observations in the domain of the real).Identification of key entities of the case (such as human actors, IT artifacts, organizational units).Abduction (identification of relevant theory or mechanisms re-contextualized in the case study).Retroduction (identification of candidate affordances).Identification of immediate concrete outcomes (high- or low-level but directly achieved through the use of technology and the realization of the goal of actors).Analysis of the interplay of human and technical entities (such as users and IT artifacts).Identification of"
"of immediate concrete outcomes (high- or low-level but directly achieved through the use of technology and the realization of the goal of actors).Analysis of the interplay of human and technical entities (such as users and IT artifacts).Identification of enabling and releasing conditions (whether affordances are actualized depends on contextual conditions that stimulate or release the outcome).Analysis of the set of affordances (identifying aggregations, groupings, dependencies or abstractions).Assessment of explanatory power (related to the events observed in step 1) and further data triangulation.FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointFramework for critical realist data analysis (developed from Bygstad et al. (2016))The described steps inform how the collected data is coded. Since CR aims at explaining experienced phenomena through causal chains--from the concrete to the abstract--this research needs to work backwards from experienced results (events and issues) towards the affordances in order to build mechanisms grounded in the data. Thus, an abductive variation of grounded theory allows the researcher to approach the research without inhibitions (open coding) but still draw upon existing theory and mechanisms via abductive reasoning and axial coding true to the principles of CR (Hoddy,2019).After the transcription of the interviews and review of documents, the data was descriptively open-coded with the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti in multiple iterations."
"reasoning and axial coding true to the principles of CR (Hoddy,2019).After the transcription of the interviews and review of documents, the data was descriptively open-coded with the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti in multiple iterations. Events and issues were extracted including the human and technical entities, such as IT artifacts, sub-organizations, teams and stakeholders of the events and issues. In the second cycle, the codes were grouped into the following framework-specific categories:Immediate concrete outcomes.Actor's goals for the platform.Enabling or releasing conditions.Starting from the most-occurring codes in each group, these categories were used to iteratively sketch affordances through the mapping of conditions, structures and low- and high-level outcomes. The process of retroduction from case data is intended to be highly creative (Tsang,2014; Wynn & Williams,2012,2020). Additionally, the network of conditions, affordances and outcomes was mapped to identify shared conditions and outcomes of affordances and enhanced with relevant and applicable IS theory and previously identified mechanisms (abduction). The affordance emerges from the relation of technology and actor that leads to a concrete outcome under enabling, stimulating and/or releasing conditions, which subsequently can alter the structure from which it emerged (Bygstad et al.,2016). The affordance model is illustrated in Figure4.FIGURE 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointAffordance"

The affordance model is illustrated in Figure4.FIGURE 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointAffordance viewpoint (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016, Figure2)Finally, mechanisms were invented by analyzing dependencies between affordances, grouping affordances, mapping to existing mechanisms and abstracting into higher-level mechanisms (Bygstad et al.,2016), before their explanatory power was assessed against the empirical evidence (Bygstad et al.,2016; Sayer,2010). An example of the process leading from data to affordances to the mechanism can be found in the Appendix B.3 CASE DESCRIPTION3.1 Medecins Sans FrontièresThis paper examines the case of the project monitoring digitalization efforts of three Operational Centers (OC) of Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF), a global humanitarian medical NGO. MSF is a large, relatively independent organization with a solid history and proven track-record in humanitarian projects. MSF provides emergency medical assistance to people affected by natural or man-made disasters, irrespective of race, religion, creed or political convictions (Medecins Sans Frontières,n.d.-b).

"Sans Frontières,n.d.-b). MSF concentrates primarily on healthcare--as one of the last few international humanitarian agencies it does not rely on a \"cumbersome coordination system that prioritizes process over outcome,\" which increases their response effectiveness (Spiegel,2017). The overall organization has an associative structure of five OCs where operational decisions are made relatively independently. MSF operates in various countries where projects are coordinated through in-country coordination offices. The OCs report to the international council and international office, and there are various cross-OC teams for specific medical or organizational topics.The following OCs were included in this study: Amsterdam (OCA), Barcelona-Athens (OCBA) and Brussels (OCB). Due to the independence of OCs, the types and related onsets of digitalization processes vary, but the common theme for all has been a gradual shift from using spreadsheet software on a per-project basis towards a web-based integrated health information system for the medical-operational monitoring (or surveillance) of projects. The distinct and shared processes and events are displayed as a timeline in Table2.TABLE  2.Timeline of key events recordedIDEventOperational center201520162017201820192020E1Excel as main tool for data collectionOCA, OCB, OCBAxxE2Creation of eHealth units, formulated goals of integrated HIS for monitoringOCA, OCBxxE3Piloting and scale-up of DHIS2 and legacy data migrationOCA, OCB,"

DHIS2 is an open source, web-based HMIS platform in use by 67 low and middle-income countries (LMIC) as well as many non-profit, non-governmental and multi-national organizations. Approximately 2.3 billion people are covered by DHIS2 (Nicholson et al.,2019). Core development and governance is carried out by the global Health Information Systems Program (HISP), a \"network of North-South-South collaboration.\" The University of Oslo is a key factor in the coordination of the program (Nicholson et al.,2019).DHIS2 is part of a promising foundation for HMIS in LMIC to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and DHIS2 \"should become the primary source of quality data for resource allocation and impact measurement\" in the public health domain (Farnham et al.,2020). Still, concerns and issues remain:"
"HMIS in LMIC to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and DHIS2 \"should become the primary source of quality data for resource allocation and impact measurement\" in the public health domain (Farnham et al.,2020). Still, concerns and issues remain: data is primarily collected in health facilities by overworked healthcare workers and later manually tallied and entered, which introduces delays and errors. These facility-level workers are not aware of the purpose of the collected data within the information life cycle. Facility-level capacity building is often inadequate or non-existent, wide-ranging data quality issues are prevalent and Internet connectivity challenges persist (Farnham et al.,2020).However, the flexibility and adaptability of the platform and related metadata model enables NGOs, such as MSF, to implement the software as their own HMIS and, if necessary, to extend functionality through platform apps compatible with the open software architecture (Nicholson et al.,2019). Thus, an organization can participate to some extent in the development of a horizontal approach or \"bottom-up empowerment\" (Walsham,2020). Since the Ministries of Health in countries where MSF operates often also use DHIS2 as their national HMIS, synergies are possible, for example, in data sharing, data integration efforts or capacity building.

"HMIS, synergies are possible, for example, in data sharing, data integration efforts or capacity building. However, as ministries often do not have the necessary skills and resources to completely take ownership of a new system or a subsequent data integration, they rely on the expertise of intermediaries such as the NGO, thereby maintaining or exacerbating the dependency on external technical assistance to adapt the generic tool of DHIS2 to their own specific and changing needs (Nicholson et al.,2019). To alleviate this, initiatives that build capacity are necessary, for example through data-use workshops. These \"collaborative peer reviews of practice\" have proven to be effective to improve the link between data quality and information use in national HMIS (Braa et al.,2012).4 FINDINGSThree mechanisms were identified in relation to the organization's HHMIS-driven project monitoring: templated analytics service; standardization; and collaborative and mobile capabilities.All affordances have structures of a human, social and technical nature (the techno-organizational structure, see Bygstad et al. (2016)) that were laid out in the introduction, background and case description and make for the context in which the affordances emerge.

"emerge. The technology is the HHMIS platform (DHIS2).4.1 The templated analytics service mechanismThe first affordance that contributes to the mechanism is visualized in Figure5and describes the provision of templated dashboards and reporting tools. The logic of the analysis framework applied to this mechanism is listed in a tabular format in the Appendix B. The enabling conditions identified are the generally recognized time constraints on humanitarian front-line staff coupled with the feature space (available functionality) of the HHMIS. The eHealth team, usually based in headquarter offices with specialized digital health expertise, provides the front-line teams with templated HHMIS dashboards containing user-adaptive items, as well as with access to user-adaptive reporting tools. A dashboard is a collection of key performance indicators for a given thematic area, containing dashboard items of analytical objects (data visualizations, such as charts or maps, and data tables, such as pivot tables) (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019). The conditions for the actualization of this affordance are that the items contained in these dashboards are configured based on the current user's associated or preferred location (the where-dimension or the \"user-orgunit\"), which enables an adaptive user interface. One participant (INT3) stated: \"they need predefined objects, like a predefined dashboard, a predefined chart, then they would use it.\" The affordance is also stimulated via a relatively"
"or the \"user-orgunit\"), which enables an adaptive user interface. One participant (INT3) stated: \"they need predefined objects, like a predefined dashboard, a predefined chart, then they would use it.\" The affordance is also stimulated via a relatively strict naming convention (a generally agreed scheme for naming metadata entities) to manage metadata in the HHMIS. The dashboard as a whole and the assembled dashboard items can only be provided effectively when their design quality is high, which depends on the data literacy of the designer (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019). These objects are then distributed as part of the configuration package by downstream synchronization (see affordance in the section of the standardization mechanism).FIGURE 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointTemplated analytical object provision affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)The concrete outcome is that front-line teams have access to consistent dashboards containing descriptive analytics for operational decision-making and related reporting tools. Standardized dashboard packages provide a level of consistency (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019). Descriptive analytics \"describe or summarize datasets making them interpretable to researchers. They allow to learn from historical events or behaviors, and understand how these may influence future events or outcomes\" (Kasthurirathne et al.,2020). Descriptive analytics require more human effort to reach a decision as compared to predictive analytics, which provide"
"from historical events or behaviors, and understand how these may influence future events or outcomes\" (Kasthurirathne et al.,2020). Descriptive analytics require more human effort to reach a decision as compared to predictive analytics, which provide estimates on the probability of future outcomes (Kasthurirathne et al.,2020).The affordance described here provides the most common analytical approach but requires user guidance. One participant (INT2) stated: \"what we trial for most [projects] is to build the dashboard that is in line in how we should use the data ... because the dashboard will be like a guidance in how you should look into your data.\"The second affordance, depicted in Figure6, shows how the front-line team accesses these analytical objects. The enabling condition is the shared understanding of the responsibility to access the platform in order to monitor the relevant indicators and the accountability of their work by backing up decisions with HHMIS-based evidence. The intrinsic value of data and data systems is generally recognized (Operational Center Brussels,2017; Vila-Pozo & Sahay,2019). A stimulating condition is the ability of the front-line team to easily reach out for user support in case of technical challenges. Other identified stimulating conditions are data literacy (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019) and the data quality of analytical objects.

"challenges. Other identified stimulating conditions are data literacy (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019) and the data quality of analytical objects. Another factor is an incentive for maintaining the dashboard and its items, as their configurations need to be updated to be useful in changing contexts and requirements. This can be quite a challenge if analyzing data is already demanding--one interviewee (INT4) stated: \"if you are the front-line doctor or medical person, you don't really have time to do all the analysis of the data, you are really concerned with treating the patient.\" This incentive is supported by intuitive user interfaces that work for less technical staff. User-designed dashboards commonly have context problems where (a) no comprehensive or useful message can be drawn from them, (b) dashboard items are not linked, (c) descriptions are missing, or (d) items are not aligned with the purpose of the dashboard (Chrysantina & Sæbø,2019). These conditions also hold true for a specific example of one OC: they developed a platform app that allowed for document-based, templated reporting of qualitative data (a narrative as found in the project situational report or \"sitrep\") with quantitative data (target-based analytical objects exported from the HHMIS) based on the aforementioned naming conventions. Sitreps are commonly used to disseminate information to and from relief workers in the field. They are intended for a cosmopolitan audience of humanitarian actors and are"
"objects exported from the HHMIS) based on the aforementioned naming conventions. Sitreps are commonly used to disseminate information to and from relief workers in the field. They are intended for a cosmopolitan audience of humanitarian actors and are painstakingly produced on the ground (Finn & Oreglia,2016). In the highly dynamic environment of humanitarian work, qualitative data is then used to give context and to justify and explain the quantitative data to a diverse set of recipients. One interviewee (INT5) stated: \"the people [that are not here] just can see the indicators and numbers, but sometimes the numbers are meaningless if you don't put any context behind.\" However, here context means \"the needs of the local population and the response of local governments and the humanitarian actors plus the gap of unmet needs\" (Finn & Oreglia,2016). The outcome of this affordance is explanatory mixed-data reporting, for example through sitreps, which act as the basis for discussion and evidence-based justifications of \"their\" data with higher levels. Often, the individual medical records are never transmitted due to data protection regulations.FIGURE 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointAdaptation of provisioned analytic tools affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)FIGURE 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointAnalytics service mechanism (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)The major challenge of the interplay between the actualizations of these affordances' is the contradiction"
"affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)FIGURE 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointAnalytics service mechanism (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)The major challenge of the interplay between the actualizations of these affordances' is the contradiction between one of the enabling conditions (time constraints of front-line staff) and a stimulating condition (incentives for the required maintenance of the dashboard and items). Through abstraction of these two affordances, this mechanism is based on the institutional accountability processes and capabilities emerging from the structure. They serve as the basis for the analytics service provision and result in specific roles with regards to data collection, use and service provision. Front-line staff routinely aggregate, tally and enter manually, as well as they use the dashboard for the day-to-day monitoring of their project-specific data. Thus they are data producers and users and analytical service users. The \"higher-level\" staff in coordination offices or headquarters who access aggregated data of multiple projects are data users. The eHealth team acts as an intermediary, the providers of the analytical service, but are neither data users nor producers. This mechanism is visualized in Figure 7.4.2 The standardization mechanismThe mechanism is based on two affordances. The first affordance, visualized in Figure8, relates to rationalization via the backtracking of metadata, resulting in quantified usage and leaner IS content."
"in Figure 7.4.2 The standardization mechanismThe mechanism is based on two affordances. The first affordance, visualized in Figure8, relates to rationalization via the backtracking of metadata, resulting in quantified usage and leaner IS content. The enabling condition is an initiative based on a shared understanding that too many data points were collected, which then were not used in reports. The affordance was stimulated by existing naming conventions in concert with management buy-in, which improved the ability of the eHealth team to institutionally access all relevant reports together with topic experts. This affordance led to a quantified usage of data collection, which reported how much of the actual data collected is eventually used (in reports), leading to a leaner content within the HHMIS and reducing the burden of collecting data for front-line project teams. This is beneficial. If resources invested in the information-gathering capabilities of humanitarian actors outweigh the capacity to deal with the information, it indicates an inefficiency. In such a case, a simplification exercise can be a factor in increasing efficiency (Read et al.,2016). An approach to the question whether analysis possibilities are already saturated with existing data might provide another promising tool for increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, a means to highlight the history and origins of data (often termed data provenance or data lineage) can increase ownership, as one"
"saturated with existing data might provide another promising tool for increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, a means to highlight the history and origins of data (often termed data provenance or data lineage) can increase ownership, as one participant (INT6) stated: \"When I was a doctor [at the organization] and collected so much data, that was also a part of the role including all the clinical management. What I did miss out on was: where is this data going and what's happening to my project, how am I contributing.\" Furthermore, data provenance can establish data origin, the chain of custody and reproducibility and automate data integrity checks (Perakslis,2018).FIGURE 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointRationalization affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)The second affordance is depicted in Figure9. It relates to an existing feature within the HHMIS platform that addresses the problem of intermittent Internet connectivity. The platform has the ability to link partly offline servers in the countries of operation to a central online instance, which is managed, for example, at headquarters. The locally deployed servers (a) update their HHMIS configuration from the central online instance, and (b) regularly upload collected data conforming to that configuration upstream to the central instance as soon as Internet connectivity is available.

"upload collected data conforming to that configuration upstream to the central instance as soon as Internet connectivity is available. This functionality has been documented before (Vila-Pozo & Sahay,2018,2019). Two conditions were identified for this affordance: centralized (configuration) data management is a prerequisite including release and deployment management. An additional condition was that software development investments into the HMIS core software were made by MSF to make it more robust and improve offline functionality (Vila-Pozo & Sahay,2018), a feature selected to be generic and relevant across countries and use cases to be included for all users of the software (Nicholson et al.,2019). At least a minimal level of Internet connectivity is required, which is not available in every project. The outcomes indicated that more iterative and selective configurations of the healthcare service monitoring were made possible, as teams do not need to wait for yearly updates to the metadata. It also led to increased front-line team independence and data ownership (Vila-Pozo & Sahay,2019). The benefits of this implementation did not go unnoticed across other OCs. The implementation led to, and is led by, an alignment of resources between the OCs related to the platform's core software.

"of resources between the OCs related to the platform's core software. Additionally, deployed infrastructure is aligned in terms of the major and minor software versions to minimize the potential for software incompatibilities and bugs between the central instance and deployed local servers. Parallels to a mechanism within HMIS in LMICs identified by Gebre-Mariam and Bygstad (2019), termed \"informatization mechanism,\" can be drawn. In the paper, they lay out the causal relations of the digitalization strategy of a national (Ethiopian) HMIS. Structural entities of data volume and variety as well as a HMIS reform of paper-based approaches led to a standardization (across data-sets and procedures), an integration (single source for data, one report channel) and an unrealized optimization intended to \"create value from data\" (enhanced insight, decision-making and process automation) (Gebre-Mariam & Bygstad,2019).FIGURE 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointSynchronization affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)The abstraction of these two affordances informs this mechanism, depicted in Figure10. The dynamics of the humanitarian context allows for fast-changing requirements and migrations to emerge; a rationalization of the IS content and subsequent synchronization occurred. They lead to the emerging standardization of IS content and software version, thus a flexible generification: \"work processes and actual use determine standards which are adapted pragmatically\" (Hanseth &"
"content and subsequent synchronization occurred. They lead to the emerging standardization of IS content and software version, thus a flexible generification: \"work processes and actual use determine standards which are adapted pragmatically\" (Hanseth & Bygstad,2015). This standardization strategy matches the highly dynamic humanitarian settings. The focus on working solutions from the bottom-up leads to lower complexity and increases the ability for ICT-based healthcare service innovation (Hanseth & Bygstad,2015). Underpinning the outcome of this complex techno-institutional dynamic are locally contingent and socially situated innovations and improvisations by actors making sense of the technologies within their context and therefore defying fundamental notions of controlled determinism (see Orlikowski,1996).FIGURE 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointStandardization mechanism (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)FIGURE 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointCollaborative analysis affordance (adapted from Bygstad et al.,2016)4.3 The collaborative and mobile capabilities mechanismThe third mechanism is described via two not fully actualized affordances. These have not yet materialized because the technical feature of the HHMIS platform is not yet available, or it is not implemented across and promoted within the organization due to limited feature availability.The first affordance relates to the ability to collaboratively analyze data directly within the HHMIS and is visualized in Figure"
"not yet available, or it is not implemented across and promoted within the organization due to limited feature availability.The first affordance relates to the ability to collaboratively analyze data directly within the HHMIS and is visualized in Figure 11. The enabling condition is an organizational need to discuss project-based data for strategic decision-making and the feature space provided by the HHMIS. A systematic literature review by Penn and Dent (2016) identifies 10 either technical or social factors that must be enhanced in a balanced approach and in a certain order to attain effective decision-making within an organization. Parts of the technical factors are not fully covered (e.g., the HHMIS is not the organization-wide data warehouse but the monitoring platform); however, the social factors are deemed relevant: a strategic vision, planning and related dialog, individuals expressing their critical thinking and the setting of transparent rules for the discourse are conditions for collaborative analysis. These factors can challenge existing beliefs by enabling decision-making within multiple groups. However, this is sometimes not the case as one interviewee stated (INT5): \"they make decisions and then look for data to back up their decision, but they don't use the data to make decisions. So we are trying to change that so that they do it the other way around.\" Different roles within the organizations should be accounted for--for example, medical referents who"
"data to back up their decision, but they don't use the data to make decisions. So we are trying to change that so that they do it the other way around.\" Different roles within the organizations should be accounted for--for example, medical referents who oversee projects do not need, or are not expected to have, the same ability as front-line teams entering data. The features should help to explain and contextualize data with others, that is, the analytical objects presented within the interpretation tool-set. One of the obstacles is a lack of access control, as an interviewee noted (INT5): \"I'm in the capital, and I put you in a comment about the project. The person who is tagged in this thread can see the data from other projects who shouldn't have access.\" Having said that, this can be necessary when multiple groups discuss a problem based on data.The second affordance (visualized in Figure 12) relates to the ability to easily access data on mobile devices, a previously identified goal of MSF (Braa & Sahay,2017). The current generation of mobile apps that seamlessly integrate with the platform focus on data collection. Interactive data analysis on mobile devices is not provided as a built-in feature, and the mobile application for accessing pre-made analytical objects has been deprecated (marking the end of official support and development). Thus, this affordance is not actualized.The enabling condition is that data is collected and available through the platform and the"
