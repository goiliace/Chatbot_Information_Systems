"a study that evaluated the UX of a mobile health application. Their results indicated that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, novelty, stimulation, and dependability all had positive mean score values. In comparison with the UEQ benchmark datasets, attractiveness, efficiency, dependability, novelty, perspicuity, and stimulation were all categorized as good. This result indicates that the overall quality of the application is high, and end-users are generally satisfied with their UX.Also, Martono [25] investigated UX on a monitoring information system. The results showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, novelty, stimulation, and dependability all had high positive mean score values, with novelty having the highest mean score value. In addition, they compared UX on the monitoring system to benchmark datasets of other software and applications. Their results showed that, except for attractiveness that had an above average score, perspicuity, efficiency, and stimulation were ranked as good. In addition, the novelty was rated as excellent. In general, the design of the monitoring system met the user's expectations. In a research conducted by Gunawan et al. [26], their findings showed that all the six scales, namely, attractiveness, perspicuity, dependability, stimulation, novelty, and efficiency, obtained an average score of above 2.0.

In addition, the benchmark comparison of their application and the benchmark datasets showed that all six scales were categorized as excellent. Thus, the system meets users' expectations.A study was carried out by Paramitha et al. [16] to evaluate a web-based system's user interface and UX. The results showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, and novelty were categorized as good, while dependability and stimulation were categorized as above average and excellent, respectively. The findings from the study indicated that the UX of the web-based application is good. Results of a similar study conducted to evaluate the usability of a mobile-based application using UEQ showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty obtained high positive mean scores [26]. Also, compared to the benchmark dataset, attractiveness and stimulation were categorized as excellent. Efficiency, dependability, and novelty were categorized as good, while perspicuity was categorized as above average. In general, the application was accepted by the end-users.

"of the reviewed studies focused on evaluating the UX of systems. However, few studies focused on how UX can influence continuance intention to use a system. Moreover, not many studies have been conducted on evaluating UX in educational systems such as SMIS and its continuance usage. In addition, studies examining UX on educational systems in HEIs in Africa, specifically in the Ghanaian HEIs, have not been adequately addressed. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate UX on SMIS and how it impacts the continuance use of such a system within a Ghanaian HEI context.3. Research Model and Hypotheses3.1. Research ModelAmoroso and Chen [28] defined continuance intention as \"the level of the strength of one's intention to continuously perform a specified behavior, which is a proxy of actual continuous use of an information system or technology.\" This study defines the continuous intention to use the SMIS as the student's willingness to continue using the SMIS. As demonstrated by some studies [28-32], the continuous intention construct is crucial for defining how a technology or system is utilised after it has been adopted. Thus, this study adopts continuance intention as a dependent variable to explain students' continuance use of SMIS. UX is the key to develop a bond between a user and a product, system, or service [33]. In addition, UX is considered a determining factor for the success of a technology [33]. In measuring UX, Laugwitz et al. [34] developed a UEQ. Furthermore, users'"
"UX is the key to develop a bond between a user and a product, system, or service [33]. In addition, UX is considered a determining factor for the success of a technology [33]. In measuring UX, Laugwitz et al. [34] developed a UEQ. Furthermore, users' overall impression of a product can be measured quickly and easily by using UEQ, which is a fast and direct measurement of UX [13]. In addition, results from several studies have shown that UEQ is a reliable measurement instrument for measuring UX [19].Thus, as shown in Figure1, we propose a research model using UEQ constructs. The proposed research model, which examines the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS, integrated the continuous intention construct with the UEQ constructs.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointResearch model.3.2. Hypotheses3.2.1. Attractiveness (ATT)Schrepp et al. [13] defined attractiveness as the \"overall impression of the product.\" Do users like or dislike it? Is it attractive, enjoyable, or pleasing? This study defines attractiveness as a student's overall impression of the SMIS. Ali and Ramlie [19] observed in their findings that students perceived the hologram tutor attractive after interacting with it. Similarly, AlGothami and Saeed [20] observed that the participants perceived the application as attractive.

"[20] observed that the participants perceived the application as attractive. In a study by Udjaja and Lailany [35], the respondents felt that the Android-based game was attractive. Also, Martin and Mauritsius [21] noted that attractiveness positively influenced the Tokopedia application's use. In the study conducted by Saleh et al. [9], it was observed that participants believed that the learning management system was attractive. We hypothesize thatH1. Attractiveness will have a significant effect on the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS3.2.2. Perspicuity (PER)In this study, perspicuity is defined as how students can easily get familiar with the SMIS. PER, considered a pragmatic quality, was found to significantly influence the perceived ease of use of a system [22]. Similarly, perspicuity significantly influences users' UX of a system [14]. Also, Ali and Ramlie [19] found that the hologram tutor was easy for students to get used to. AlGothami and Saeed [20] in their study found that participants could easily get familiar with the application. Similarly, Udjaja and Lailany [35] found that respondents were able to easily get familiar with the Android-based game. Findings from Saleh et al. [9] showed that participants found it easier to use the LMS. Therefore, we hypothesize thatH2. Perspicuity will significantly affect the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS3.2.3.

"found it easier to use the LMS. Therefore, we hypothesize thatH2. Perspicuity will significantly affect the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS3.2.3. Efficiency (EFF)Efficiency is defined in this study as to how students can solve their tasks using the SMIS without unnecessary effort. Bayu and Setiawan [14] in their study's result indicated that efficiency influenced the UX of a system. Also, Hussain et al. [36] observed that efficiency significantly affected the use of mood tracker applications. Similarly, students indicated that interacting with the hologram tutor and completing a learning task were without any unnecessary effort [19]. AlGothami and Saeed [20] noted in their study that participants completed the task by using the application without any unnecessary effort. Similarly, Saleh et al. [9] noted that participants considered the LMS efficient. Hence, we hypothesize thatH3. Efficiency will significantly affect the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS3.2.4. Dependability (DEP)Dependability is defined in this study as how students feel in control of the interaction with the SMIS. Mlekus et al. [22] identified that dependability positively affected the perceived ease of use of a system. Also, Bayu and Setiawan [14] noted that dependability affects the UX of a system.

Similarly, it was observed that participants felt in control of the interaction with the application AlGothami and Saeed [20]. Findings from Martin and Mauritsius [21] showed that dependability influenced respondents' use of the Tokopedia application. Krisnawati et al. [37] in their study noted that users felt in control of the interaction with the online exam system. Therefore, it is hypothesized thatH4. Dependability will significantly impact the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS3.2.5. Stimulation (STI)Stimulation is defined as \"Is it exciting and motivating to use the product? Is it fun to use?\" [13]. In this study, we define stimulation as how students are excited or motivated to use the SMIS. Bayu and Setiawan [14] observed in their findings that stimulation had a positive effect on the UX of a system. Similarly, the results from the study conducted by Ali and Ramlie [19] showed that students were excited and motivated to use the hologram tutor. Findings by AlGothami and Saeed [20] showed that participants were excited and motivated to use the application.

Stimulation significantly affects the continuance intention of students to use SMIS3.2.6. Novelty (NOV)Schrepp et al. [13] defined novelty as \"Is the product innovative and creative? Does it capture users' attention?\" In this study, we define novelty as how students consider the SMIS innovative and creative. Mlekus et al. [22] in their study's result suggested that novelty significantly impacted users' behavioral intention to use a system. Similarly, novelty was found to have a significant effect on the user experience of a system (Bayu and Setiawan [14]). Also, Ali and Ramlie [19] noted that students considered the hologram tutor to be innovative and creative. The application which was considered innovative and creative by participants in a study conducted by the authors in references [20,21] showed that novelty had a positive impact on the use of the Tokopedia application. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:H6. Novelty significantly affects students' continuance intention to use SMIS4. Research Methodology4.1.

"study, the UEQ, a measurement instrument developed originally by Laugwitz et al. [34], that has been tested and widely acknowledged as a valid test for measuring user experience by several studies, was adopted to collect data. There are two sections in the questionnaire. The first section presents the demographic profile of the responders. It comprises four items reflecting gender, age, the faculty to which a student belongs, and the student's education level. The second section has the six main UEQ constructs, which consist of twenty-six items, with each item consisting of two terms with opposite meanings. In addition, there is a construct measuring students' continuance intention to use SMIS, which has five items. The six main constructs of UEQ consist of attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty. Attractiveness consists of the following six items: annoying/enjoyable, good/bad, unlikable/pleasing, unpleasant/pleasant, attractive/unattractive, and friendly/unfriendly [13]. Perspicuity has four items, which consist of the following items: understandable/understandable, easy to learn/difficult to learn, complicated/easy, and clear/confusing [13]. Also, efficiency has the following four items: fast/slow, inefficient/efficient, impractical/practical, and organized/cluttered [13]. Similarly, dependability has the following four items: unpredictable/predictable, obstructive/supportive, secure/not secure, and meets expectations/does not meet"
"items: fast/slow, inefficient/efficient, impractical/practical, and organized/cluttered [13]. Similarly, dependability has the following four items: unpredictable/predictable, obstructive/supportive, secure/not secure, and meets expectations/does not meet expectations [13]. Stimulation has the following four items: valuable/inferior, boring/exciting, not interesting/interesting, and motivating/demotivating [13]. The novelty consists of the following four items: creative/dull, inventive/conventional, usual/leading-edge, and conservative/innovative [13]. In all, there are thirty-one items measuring all constructs on a seven-point Likert scale. Before the data collection, twenty-five students and colleagues with expertise in measurement instruments examined the questionnaire to ensure that it was well-structured. The UEQ measurement instrument was modified to make the questions easier to comprehend and accommodate the context within which students use the SMIS. The underlying constructs of the UEQ measurement instrument were, however, maintained.4.2. Data CollectionUser-driven evaluations of software's usability and quality frequently employ questionnaires [20].

"to evaluate students' continuance intention to use the SMIS and their UX. The online questionnaire survey was designed based on UEQ and distributed via students' social media platforms. One recommended method for carrying out online surveys is convenience sampling [38]. Thus, convenience sampling was used in this study. The data were collected at KTU during the second semester of the academic year 2021/2022. The online survey was completed by 415 students from different faculties at different levels of study.According to Hair et al. [39], \"the minimum sample size should be ten times the maximum number of arrowheads pointing at a latent variable anywhere in the PLS path model.\" In our study, the proposed research model has six arrowheads pointing at our latent variable. As a result, 60 should be the minimum sample size when applying the 10 times rule. However, our sample size of 415 is sufficient and exceeds the study's minimum sample size requirement when using the PLS path model. Of the 415 respondents, 236 (56.87%) were females and 179 (43.13%) were males. In addition, most respondents were between the ages of 17 and 24. Also, most respondents were pursuing a Higher National Diploma programme.

Data AnalysisThe study used the PLS-SEM method and the UEQ data analysis tool (Excel) to evaluate the model. The PLS-SEM method was used to evaluate the measurement model's reliability and validity. In addition, the PLS-SEM method was used to test the relationships among the constructs in the proposed research model. The UEQ data analysis tool (Excel) was also employed in analysing the UEQ data in terms of mean, variance, Guttman's Lambda-2 coefficients, and benchmarks.5. Results5.1. Measurement ModelCronbach's alpha coefficient (α), composite reliability (CR), Guttman's Lambda-2 coefficient (λ-2), average variance extracted (AVE), and the Fornell-Larcker criterion were used to examine the model's reliability and validity. The reliability of the measurement model was evaluated usingα, CR, andλ-2. It has been recommended by the authors in reference [40] thatαvalues between 0.6 and 0.7 are deemed acceptable.

"The reliability of the measurement model was evaluated usingα, CR, andλ-2. It has been recommended by the authors in reference [40] thatαvalues between 0.6 and 0.7 are deemed acceptable. In addition, values ofαthat are 0.8 or higher are considered a good level. Also, the authors in [39] stated that CR values that are more than or equal to 0.70 could be regarded as acceptable. Similarly,λ-2 values greater than 0.70 are acceptable [41,42]. Table2shows that the values ofαare more than 0.8. Similarly, from Table2, we see that the values of CR are greater than 0.70. Also, from Table3, the values forλ-2 are greater than 0.70. Consequently, the proposed model is reliable. AVE was used to test the measurement model's validity. A value of 0.50 or higher for the AVE is considered acceptable [39]. All AVE values in Table2are above 0.60. Thus, the proposed model's convergent validity is established.Table  2.Construct reliability and validity.ConstructαCRAVEATT0.9000.9220.663CIK0.9200.9440.807DEP0.9650.9750.906EFF0.9540.9670.880NOV0.9630.9730.899PER0.8350.8900.671STI0.8870.9220.746Table  3.Reliability of Guttman's Lambda-2 coefficient.Constructλ-2ATT0.900DEP0.965EFF0.952NOV0.962PER0.849STI0.886According to the authors in reference [39], the Fornell-Larcker criterion for determining the discriminant validity of a measurement model requires the square root of AVE of a construct be greater than the correlations of other constructs below that particular construct.

Discussion and ImplicationsThe study aimed to investigate UEQ constructs influencing students' continuous use of SMIS in a Ghanaian technical university. In addition, the study also examined the UX of SMIS. The proposed research model used constructs from the UEQ and incorporated continuous intention to use constructs. The constructs from the UEQ have shown from prior studies to be a reliable measurement instrument in measuring UX [19]. Consequently, our findings have shown that constructs from the UEQ significantly influence students' continuance intention to use SMIS. Except for dependability, all other constructs were significant in determining students' continuance use of SMIS. Also, the findings on examining the UX of SMIS showed that DEP, EFF, and NOV were rated excellent, while ATT, PER, and STI were rated good.This study's findings indicate that the relationship between ATT and CIK (Continuance Intention to use KCS SMIS) is significant for the students' continuous intention to use SMIS.

"ATT and CIK (Continuance Intention to use KCS SMIS) is significant for the students' continuous intention to use SMIS. This finding suggests that students' overall impressions of the SMIS would positively influence their continuance intention to use the SMIS. Thus, confirming the findings of some previous research [9,19-21,35]. Also, the findings of the UX of SMIS showed that attractiveness, which is the overall impression a student has of the SMIS, was rated good. This finding shows that 10% of the results in the benchmark dataset were better than the evaluated ATT of SMIS. However, 75% of the benchmark dataset results were worse off compared to the ATT of SMIS. Thus, the UX of SMIS can be considered satisfactory. Also, ATT obtained a positive mean score of 1.521, which implies that students had a positive impression and were generally satisfied with the SMIS.Similarly, this research showed that the relationship between PER and CIK is significant. This finding implies that when students easily get familiar with the SMIS, they will continue to use the SMIS. This result corroborates the findings of previous research [9,19,20,22,35,36]. PER, which explains how students can easily get familiar with the SMIS, was rated as good. This implies that 10% of the results in the benchmark dataset were better than the evaluated PER of SMIS.

"This implies that 10% of the results in the benchmark dataset were better than the evaluated PER of SMIS. However, 75% of the results from the benchmark dataset were worse off as compared to the PER of SMIS. Furthermore, the findings showed that PER had a positive mean score of 1.570. Thus, students considered their UX of SMIS satisfactory.In this study, there is a significant relationship between EFF and CIK, and the findings showed that EFF positively influenced the continuance intention of students to use the SMIS. Therefore, when students assert that they can solve their tasks using the SMIS without unnecessary effort, they will continue to use the SMIS. This result is consistent with prior research [9,14,19,20,36]. Also, the findings of the UX on SMIS showed that EFF was categorized as excellent. This result showed that the evaluated EFF of SMIS is among the top 10% of the results from the benchmark dataset. Similarly, EFF obtained the highest positive mean score value of 2.028. This demonstrates that the SMIS provides sufficient students' UX to be successful.Also, the study's results showed that the relationship between DEP and CIK is not significant for the students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. This relationship's insignificance suggests that students have had control of interaction with other similar systems that did not inure to their benefits.

"insignificance suggests that students have had control of interaction with other similar systems that did not inure to their benefits. Thus, their ability to be in control of the interaction with the SMIS does not necessarily influence their continuance use of the SMIS. Thus, this finding is inconsistent with previous research findings [14,19-22]. DEP, which explains whether students feel they are in control of the interaction with the SMIS, was categorized as excellent. This result showed that the evaluated DEP of the SMIS is among the top 10% of the results from the benchmark dataset. In addition, the results indicated that DEP had a positive value of 1.850. This demonstrates that the SMIS provides sufficient UX to be successful. This implies that students felt generally satisfied with the UX on SMIS.Similarly, this study's findings indicated that STI positively influenced CIK. This result shows that when students are excited and motivated to use the SMIS, they will continue to use it. This finding corroborates the results of previous research [9,14,19,20,21]. Findings of the UX on SMIS indicated that STI was categorized as good. This implies that 10% of the results in the benchmark dataset were better than the evaluated STI of SMIS.

"STI of SMIS. However, the evaluated STI of the SMIS was better than 75% of the results from the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the results showed that STI obtained a positive mean score of 1.468. Thus, students opined that they had adequate UX on SMIS to continue its usage.The study's findings showed that novelty positively influenced students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. This result suggests that if students consider the SMIS to be innovative and creative, it will significantly affect their intention to continue using such a system. This finding confirms the findings of previous research [14,19-22]. NOV, which explains how students consider the SMIS to be creative and innovative was rated as excellent. This result showed that the evaluated NOV of the SMIS is among the top 10% of the results from the benchmark dataset. This demonstrates that the SMIS provides sufficient UX to be successful. Also, NOV obtained a positive mean score of 1.811. This implies that students had positive UX on SMIS.The study's outcome provides some practical implications for UX designers, developers, and management of technical universities to consider in ensuring continuous usage of SMIS. The results showed that attractiveness significantly influenced students' continuous intention to use the SMIS. Similarly, the UX findings showed that attractiveness was rated good.

"influenced students' continuous intention to use the SMIS. Similarly, the UX findings showed that attractiveness was rated good. Thus, UX designers and developers must ensure that they design and develop SMIS that will be more attractive, enjoyable, and pleasing to the students. Also, the findings showed that perspicuity positively impacted students' intention to continue using the SMIS. In addition, it was rated as good. Thus, UX designers are encouraged to design front-end interfaces that are visually appealing and engaging to users.Furthermore, UX designers and developers should ensure that they provide SMIS that is not complex to interact with. Rather such systems should have easy-to-use interfaces that will enable students to easily get familiar with such systems. Similarly, efficiency has been shown to be important in significantly influencing students' intention to continue using the SMIS. In addition, it was rated as excellent. It is important for development teams to ensure that the functionalities of SMIS are efficient and perform the necessary tasks without much effort.

"they should provide help functionalities and system user manuals that can assist students in performing learning tasks effortlessly. The study also revealed that stimulation positively affects students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. Also, UX findings showed that it was rated good. It implies that when students are excited and motivated about using the SMIS, they will continue using the SMIS. Thus, the management of technical universities must create some excitement and awareness about the SMIS via social media platforms, university websites, and posters. In addition, management should consider instituting some reward mechanisms that will motivate students to continue using the system. The study also showed that novelty positively impacted students' continued use of the SMIS.Consequently, UX designers and developers must ensure that they provide an innovative and creative SMIS. Management of technical universities must ensure that when they request for SMIS, such a system must have key UX characteristics such as attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, stimulation, and novelty as part of the user requirement specification document. End-users are vital elements in the value of systems and should be more involved during the development. Thus, the management must ensure that there is a collaboration between the development team and students during the design and development of the SMIS.

"the development. Thus, the management must ensure that there is a collaboration between the development team and students during the design and development of the SMIS. Prototypes of systems could be designed to elicit feedback from students during the development process. In addition, students must be involved in evaluating the system after it has been deployed.From a theoretical perspective, by utilizing the UEQ constructs as a base model and incorporating continuance intention to use, we proposed a research model that can be used to examine continuance intention to use SMIS. The study's findings provide researchers from other developing countries the opportunity to replicate this study in examining continuance intention to use SMIS from the context of UX characteristics. Also, the study contributes to the body of knowledge on the continued use of SMIS using UX characteristics from the perspective of Ghanaian higher educational institutions (HEIs). Furthermore, the study also contributes to the literature on evaluating SMIS based on UX characteristics. Thus, researchers from other developing countries can replicate this study by adopting UX characteristics to evaluate SMIS.7.

"that could be addressed through further research to improve its findings. We discovered that using convenience sampling resulted in an unbalanced distribution of respondents from different faculties, potentially affecting the overall representation of respondents in the study area. Therefore, findings from this study cannot be generalized to reflect all the faculties in the study area. We recommend that future studies should explore other sampling techniques that will address a well-balanced representation of respondents in the target study area. The continuance use of the SMIS might not only depend on the scales of UEQ, but other factors could influence the continuance use of the system. We also recommend that future studies explore other factors with the UEQ to examine the continuance use of the system.8. ConclusionWith the increasing number of HEIs in developing countries investing in the implementation and deployment of SMIS, there is a need for the management of such institutions to ensure that such systems meet the expectations of students, which will then lead to their continuance usage. Thus, this study sought to examine students' continuance intention to use SMIS using UEQ and evaluated students' UX on SMIS. A research model for examining the continuance intention to use SMIS was proposed and validated. The study's findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, stimulation, and novelty influenced students' continuance intention to use the SMIS."
"A research model for examining the continuance intention to use SMIS was proposed and validated. The study's findings showed that attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, stimulation, and novelty influenced students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. However, dependability was insignificant in influencing students' continuance intention to use the SMIS. Furthermore, in evaluating students' UX on SMIS, dependability, efficiency, and novelty were rated excellent, while attractiveness, perspicuity, and stimulation were rated as good. The findings from the study provide UX designers and developers insights into designing and developing a more attractive, enjoyable, and not complex SMIS that is pleasing and easy to interact with. Also, the findings show that UX designers and developers should provide user guides to assist students in performing learning tasks effortlessly. The findings also show that the management of HEIs should create some excitement and awareness about the use of SMIS via social media platforms, university websites, and posters. In addition, the management of HEIs should institute mechanisms for rewarding students who continue using the SMIS and they should ensure continuous collaboration between the SMIS developers, the ICT department, and the student body.

"AbstractIn order to solve the problem of green urban garden landscape design, a green urban garden landscape design method based on GIS system is proposed. This method introduces component GIS and compares three AO-based GIS secondary development modes. Based on the developed solution, comprehensively considering the index evaluation of urban landscaping and its influencing factors, the functional structure of the GIS-based landscaping management information system is designed, and the system requirements are analyzed in detail. It solves the problem that the cost of traditional green urban garden landscape design is too high, and the experiment proves that improving the landscape environment of urban public space has practical value for the research of urban landscape system. Combined with practical application, it is found that the intervention of rainwater landscape can effectively improve the aesthetics and artistry of urban rainwater public facilities. At the same time, the development of GIS and its related technologies (such as database technology and network technology) has also promoted the construction and development of urban landscaping system, which has a great effect on the beautification of the environment, which verifies the validity of the experiment.1.

"verifies the validity of the experiment.1. IntroductionAn important index to measure the level of urban greening is the urban green space rate (public green space, residential green space, unit affiliated green space, protective green space, production green space, and scenic forest land) and the green time coefficient. An important indicator for evaluating the level of urban greening is the urban green space rate. In the comprehensive aerial remote sensing survey, through the combination of remote sensing image interpretation and field measurement, the relationship between remote sensing image characteristics and plant height and DBH is found out, and the \"three-dimensional greening index\" or \"green quantity\" index is proposed to replace the original \"greening coverage\" index to evaluate the urban greening level [1]. The study points out that the grassland, shrub, and tree in the same area have the same green coverage, but have different green amount. Under the condition of the same area, the order of its ecological functions (oxygen production and CO2 absorption) is: tree > shrub > ground cover or lawn, and the ecological function of trees is ten times that of lawn or ground cover. Tall trees are the main elements for the selection of scenery in the residential area. To improve the level of urban greening, we should not only improve the greening coverage, but also improve the \"three-dimensional greening index,\" that is, to improve the quality of greening.

"the selection of scenery in the residential area. To improve the level of urban greening, we should not only improve the greening coverage, but also improve the \"three-dimensional greening index,\" that is, to improve the quality of greening. Geographic information system (GIS) has been widely used in agriculture, forestry, and other industries in various countries. In China's urban landscaping management, some cities have developed urban landscaping management information systems in line with their actual conditions. Using geographic information system (GIS), we can timely and accurately understand the current situation and changes of urban green space resources and establish a landscaping system with the help of GIS and its spatial analysis function, which can improve the efficiency of urban landscaping management. Therefore, combined with the actual situation, the development of a set of local urban landscaping management information system with the help of ArcGIS Engine can not only improve the greening management efficiency and realize scientific management, but also provide data statistics and other functions for the landscaping department, so as to improve the work efficiency and data accuracy, which is of great significance to improve the management of urban ecological construction [2].

Literature ReviewGu and Wei, in the middle of the last century, began the theoretical research on the application of information management to specific work [3]. Americans first invented computer-integrated manufacturing system in the early stage, and then, further evolved into management information system, which is widely used in all walks of life. Wang believes that in the following decades, information technology has developed greatly, and in the 1990s, it has made a qualitative leap [4]. Shan et al. found that the definition of the so-called enterprise information management is to adopt digital processing for all steps in the operation of the enterprise and use the current computer information technology for integrated processing, which is conducive to improving the work efficiency of the enterprise, the development of the global economy, and the core competitiveness of the enterprise [5]. Hu and Gong found that since the twenty-first century, most of the European and American countries led by the United States and Britain have realized enterprise information management, which can increase the competitive strength"
"of the enterprise [5]. Hu and Gong found that since the twenty-first century, most of the European and American countries led by the United States and Britain have realized enterprise information management, which can increase the competitive strength of enterprises [6]. Deng et al. believe that China has experienced more than 30 years of reform, opening up and modernization, and has made great progress in information management [7]. Not only are enterprises the first to accept information management, but most relevant parts of the government also adopt information management, which is conducive to improving the work efficiency of the government. Although China's information management is not long, it has made great achievements in the past. Nevertheless, Xu found that compared with most of the European and American countries led by the United States and Britain, China's level of government information management is still relatively low [8]. At the same time, Gao et al. found that the economic development of various parts of China is different, which leads to the unbalanced development of government and enterprise informatization. The main performance is that emerging high-efficiency enterprises, export-oriented enterprises with the ability to explore the international market and large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are developing rapidly, while small- and medium-sized enterprises and some old enterprises without competitive strength and poor efficiency are"
"with the ability to explore the international market and large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are developing rapidly, while small- and medium-sized enterprises and some old enterprises without competitive strength and poor efficiency are developing very slowly [9]. In addition, He and Zhu found that enterprises are more and more aware of the importance of informatization. They clearly know that if they want to survive and develop well, they must move towards informatization. Only in this way can they improve the competitive strength of enterprises [10]. Yonghui et al. believe that the landscaping information management system integrates modern management theory, database technology, network communication technology, and computer technology to maximize the development and sharing of landscaping information management resources [11]. Huang et al. said that at this stage, China's landscaping information management has not reached a high degree of informatization [12]. The following are examples:(1)The overall level is not high. Compared with other industries, China's overall level of information management in the construction of landscaping is still not high, there is an imbalance in development among regions, and the investment is not high, there is no popularization, and there is a lack of corresponding standards.(2)Management and informatization are not fully integrated, and there is a certain disconnection.

"investment is not high, there is no popularization, and there is a lack of corresponding standards.(2)Management and informatization are not fully integrated, and there is a certain disconnection. When using computers to deal with work and business, it is impossible to deal with it completely according to the actual work process. There is no good cooperation and a certain disconnection. It is difficult to correctly reflect the management and service situation. At the same time, the landscaping information management system with the characteristics of informatization still has many imperfections. First, a single system function has no way to meet the current needs of landscaping information management. Second, the landscaping information management system used in other provinces and cities is lack of universality, and there is no way to use it in every region. In addition, some information of the system cannot be shared. However, at present, the landscaping information management has begun to move towards networking, integration, and intelligence, which is conducive to improve the information level of landscaping. In the research of landscaping information management system, it has achieved certain results. But there are still many problems. Therefore, we study the design of landscaping information management system, grasp the dynamics of advanced management system at any time, absorb useful experience, and apply it in landscaping information management system in time.3."

Therefore, we study the design of landscaping information management system, grasp the dynamics of advanced management system at any time, absorb useful experience, and apply it in landscaping information management system in time.3. Method3.1. ArcObject Component SetArcObject component set is a series of COM component sets developed by C + + and built based on Microsoft COM technology [13]. It is the development platform of ArcMap, ArcCatalog, and ArcScene in ArcGIS family. It has an independent platform, supports obese- and thin-skinned users, and supports GIS desktop applications. Developers can design powerful and flexible applications based on ArcObject devices to meet a wide range of user needs.In ArcGIS8.3, ArcObject is not an independent application product, but a software development package bundled in ArcGIS desktop purchased by users. In ArcGIS9.0, ESRI launched ArcGIS Engine, which enables ArcObject to be published and used as a separate product [14], as shown in Table1.1.ArcGIS Engine components.Developer componentsMap presentationMap analysisData accessBase services3.2.

ArcObject's object model diagram uses UML notation.Abstract class: cannot be used to create objects. But a description of subclasses. For example, \"line\" can be an abstract class of \"main line\" and \"secondary line\" [15].Class that can be created: refers to the object that can be directly created in the development environment with object definition syntax. For example, it can be written as dim as new < Object > and CreateObject < Object > in VB.Instantiable class: new objects cannot be created directly. However, objects of this kind can be created as properties of other classes or through the use of other classes.In these three categories, there are several possible types of class relationship.Associations: indicates that there is some semantic connection between two classes.

Diversity is defined at both ends. For example, one field can have multiple owners, and one owner can also own multiple fields, as shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointType inheritance: defines a special class, which shares attributes and methods with its parent class and has its own additional attributes and methods [16]. For example, a primary line and a secondary line (both classes can be created) are the types of a line (abstract class), as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointInstance: describes the object of a class. One of its methods can be used to create objects of other classes. For example, an \"electrode\" object may have a method to create a \"transformer\" object, as shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAggregation: it is an asymmetric connection, in which objects from one class are considered as a whole and objects from another class are considered as local [17]. If there are three transformers in a \"transformer\" bank, \"transformers\" and \"transformer bank\" are related, but after the \"transformer bank\" is removed, \"transformers\" may still exist.Composition: a stronger form of aggregation in which objects from the overall class control the lifetime of objects from some classes.

The \"electrode\" object controls the life of the \"crossbar\" object, as shown in Figures5and6[18].Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFor the tedious GIS development work, the ideal solution is the practicability of a component-based development framework, which allows solution providers or internal developers to quickly build industry-specific GIS application software. The GIS development base should provide the necessary spatial analysis work that software applications need to complete and allow software developers to focus on the specific design needs of the software. ArcGIS Engine of ESRI company is such a GIS framework. It is created in response to the request of ESRI users. It can classify rich ArcGIS technologies by products and embed its spatial analysis function into new or existing application software [19].ArcGIS is a group of integrated family GIS software products, which can be used to publish perfect and upgradeable GIS systems in single projects, working groups, and enterprise projects.

System management is the basis for the operation of the accounting information system. It provides public account sets, annual accounts, and other related basic data for other subsystems. The operators of each subsystem also need to set and assign functional rights in the system management. Application objects are divided into system managers and application managers. The functional structure of system management is shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointGreening management is divided into query of greening object information, input of new greening information, and browsing of specific information of greening object. Among them, the query of greening object information is divided into query according to greening type information, query according to the location of greening area, query of greening object creation time cycle, and query of greening object existing maintenance status [21], as shown in Figure9.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.3.

Measure the Accessibility Index of the Whole NetworkThe average accessibility index represents the average value of the accessibility of each node in the network, which is usually used to evaluate the overall accessibility level of the traffic network, as shown in formula (1).(1)Network connectivity reflects the average number of lines connected by each node, which is the ratio of the number of lines in the network to the number of nodes in the network, as shown in formula (2).(2)Network stretch is mainly reflected by network diameter and network stretch index, as shown in formulas (3) and (4).(3)(4)Yang Tao and others defined the accessibility of transportation network as shown in formula (5).Mis the network.(5)Spatial barrier model is based on graph theory to analyze the reachability of nodes in the network. The model defines reachability as the difficulty of overcoming barriers in space. The model is shown in formula (6).(6)The model is simple in form and takes the spatial barrier between two nodes as a numerical index to evaluate accessibility. The calculation is convenient and the results are easy to explain, the location information of the node can be well reflected. The model is widely used in traffic network research.

"of the node can be well reflected. The model is widely used in traffic network research. The disadvantage is that all nodes are treated equally and lack of consideration of accessibility factors such as land use, so it cannot accurately reflect the actual accessibility of nodes [22].The cumulative opportunity model focuses on the difficulty of nodes approaching opportunities. Accessibility refers to the number of opportunities that can be accessed from a node using a specific mode of transportation within a certain threshold. Through a given threshold, the number of all opportunities (shopping, medical treatment, school, etc.,) exposed within the threshold range is defined as the accessibility of a specific node [23]. The more the opportunities, the better the accessibility. Cumulative opportunity model is usually used to evaluate the accessibility of service facilities, as shown in formula (7).(7)The equilibrium coefficient model is the most general spatial interaction model. Proposed the calculation method of reachability by using the direct maximum law of statistical method and gave four representative models: production constraint model, attraction constraint model, double constraint model, and unconstrained model. Among them, the most commonly used in accessibility is the double constraint model, and the formula is shown in formula (8).(8)where,Tijis the travel volume from traffic areaitoj,OiandDjare the number of activities in traffic areasiandj,F(dij) is the distance"

Hansen proposed it in 1959. It mainly uses potential index to evaluate accessibility. The general expression of the model is shown in formula (11).(11)Aiindicates the accessibility from zoneito all opportunity points;Sjrepresents the attraction of opportunity pointj;F(dij) represents the distance attenuation function, which is generally expressed by negative power function, as shown in formula (12).(12)The potential energy model in formula (12) only considers the attraction point, but does not consider the demand point (the competition between demand points for services). By introducing the supply-demand ratio index, the different attraction points are treated in a hierarchical manner, considering the interaction between them. The improved model is shown in formula (13).(13)where,Aiis gravitational accessibility,nis the total number of attraction points,Sjis the attraction of pointj, andVjis the competition intensity of service demand, as shown in formula (14).(14)Jin Fengjun (2004) puts"

Ease of access is inversely proportional to the number of access coefficients, with the average network having the lowest coefficient.Relative accessibility can better reflect the change trend of node accessibility and the position of nodes in the network. Relative accessibility can be expressed as shown in formula (17).(17)where,RCiis the relative accessibility value of nodei, and the smaller the value, the easier it is for the node to contact with the other nodes,Aiis the accessibility value of nodei,Amax is the maximum value of node accessibility in the network and the minimum value of node accessibility inAmin network.

Accessibility coefficient and relative accessibility are usually used to standardize the calculated accessibility value, so as to eliminate the influence of dimension on accessibility evaluation.Accessibility coefficient and relative accessibility index are mainly used to indicate the position of nodes in the whole traffic network.Spatial accessibility measurement is carried out between the starting point and the target point. Before the measurement, the target point data should be obtained. The target point data is usually obtained by land use status map or remote sensing land use interpretation and classification. Data acquisition refers to the use of a device that automatically collects data from various data sources into one device. The collected data are various physical quantities that have been converted into electrical signals, such as temperature, water level, wind speed, pressure, etc., which can be analog or digital. The acquisition is generally a sampling method, that is, the same point data is repeatedly collected at a certain time interval (called a sampling period). Most of the collected data are instantaneous values, but also a characteristic value within a certain period of time. Accurate data measurement is the foundation of data collection, such as Baidu map point of interest (POIs) data [24].

When using the spatial interaction model to measure accessibility, we should also consider the attraction of the target point. The selection of attraction index should be defined according to the actual problems and the characteristics of supply and demand points. The common attraction points in accessibility evaluation are social service facilities, transportation stations, urban nodes, etc., according to the investigation of urban residents' daily travel behavior, residents' visit questionnaire, etc., The attraction reference indexes of common attraction points are shown in Tables3and4.3.Common attraction point data and attraction index a.Attraction typeAttractiveness indexSchoolTeachers, school area, school hardware quality, etc.,HospitalStrength of doctors, number of hospital beds, etc.,MarketMall scale, number of employees, average annual profit, etc.,Bus stationBus station scale, average daily passenger flow of bus station, etc.,4.Common attraction point data and attraction index b.Attraction typeAttractiveness indexParkPark area, daily average number of tourists, etc.,EnterpriseEnterprise employees, etc.,Train stationStation scale, daily average passenger flow of railway station, etc.,Town nodeGDP, number of registered residences, etc.,After system performance inspection, when there are more than 100 users on the"

In addition, the throughput of the platform was tested, and as the number of users of the platform increased, so did the response time of the platform. All businesses of refined urban management focus on population, housing, events, and other information, so population, housing, and events are the basic information of all work. Business development is based on these basic information, and these businesses themselves are the focus of urban integrated service management [25].Generally speaking, the organizational structure of government departments with different functions will be adjusted with the change of management system and the revolution of management mode, but their functions (business areas) in social life are relatively stable [26]. Due to such characteristics, when building data resources, from the perspective of stability and independence, the concept of a data environment called the \"subject domain model\" is introduced from the standpoint of stability and independence.The subject domain model is different from the business system domain model."

With the change of management mode and process system, the definition of data resources may be adjusted, and this adjustment may occur frequently.According to the above data analysis, the data classification and relationship of the subject domain model are shown in Figure10.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4. Results and AnalysisThe rainwater in the city will eventually enter the rainwater collection \"surface\" of the city, that is, the final storage site of rainwater, after the retention and absorption of the source link, the dredging, purification and peak control of the process link [27]. For the design of urban rainwater collection surface, the technical measures of urban rainwater landscape include ecological wetland, multi-functional regulation and storage tank, landscape rainwater pond, etc., As the terminal hub of urban rainwater collection, landscape design is more important. The rainwater collection surface in the city can be reasonably set according to the distribution of \"rainwater community\" and the rainwater runoff in the community.

"collection, landscape design is more important. The rainwater collection surface in the city can be reasonably set according to the distribution of \"rainwater community\" and the rainwater runoff in the community. As the end link of rainwater runoff, the storage function of rainwater and the surrounding landscape effect have become the key of ecological landscape design.The collection surface control of urban rainwater mainly includes the design of rainwater wetland and rainwater lake in rainwater landscape measures [28]. When the rainwater passes through the process link of rainwater dredging, it is preliminarily purified, while the storage tank in the terminal link can purify the rainwater twice. After precipitation and purification, the rainwater in the terminal link can not only be directly used for landscape greening around the urban rainwater collection surface, but also be purified by purification equipment for domestic and sanitary water in the city.The concept of \"rainwater community\" is of a great significance not only in the collection and utilization of urban rainwater, but also in the design of urban public landscape. Firstly, through the application of GIS system, we can have a more detailed and in-depth understanding of the geographical and geomorphic characteristics of the city.

According to the geographical characteristics of the city, scientifically divide the \"rainwater community\" to make the urban rainwater landscape planning and design more targeted. Secondly, the concept of \"rainwater community\" puts forward a new theoretical method for urban rainwater landscape design and provides a scientific basis for the construction of sponge city in China. In addition, in terms of building an ecological city, through the exploration of \"rainwater community,\" it can effectively control urban rain and flood disasters, reduce the waste of urban rainwater resources, improve the landscape environment of urban public space, and have practical value for the research of urban landscape system. Finally, the intervention of rainwater landscape can effectively improve the aesthetics and artistry of urban rainwater public facilities.The overall terrain of the city is high in the southeast and low in the northwest, with an average altitude of about 410m. It faces the Weihe River and the Loess Plateau in the north and the Qinling Mountains in the south. Its unique geographical location has created a semi-humid continental monsoon climate with rich precipitation. The city is one of the earliest cities in human history.

The massive application of impervious pavement materials has cut off the natural circulation system of urban rainwater resources and brought a series of urban rainwater problems to the city. Many economically developed countries and regions have made a lot of efforts and contributions in the design and research of rainwater landscape, and achieved certain landscape and ecological benefits.

The management and control of rainwater through the way of ecological landscape can not only make effective use of rainwater resources, but also play an important role in the optimization of urban environmental landscape. Scientific and reasonable restoration of rainwater infiltration should be based on the fine analysis and cognition of urban geographic information.With the analysis of ArcGIS software, we can find out the main catchment routes and catchment low points with different height differences in a city. Based on the elevation data analysis of a city's road system, we can also simulate the geographical characteristics of a city's road system, analyze its hydrological characteristics and draw a conclusion. According to the analysis of road elevation data, combined with the rainwater collection area in the surrounding terrain, a triangular core area in the figure is formed. This area is the main catchment area in the road system of a city, that is, the \"rainwater community\" analyzed in the article.

During testing, the instrument measures performance and issues data recovery requests. After doing data multiple times, you can get multiple sets of performance files, allowing you to conduct scientific analysis of the platform. Because the test performance is related to many resources in the platform, it is necessary to monitor and analyze the platform through some tools, so as to meet the needs of optimizing the platform. When testing, we should also analyze the application in detail, which can help analyze the difficult problems in the code and deal with the performance defects in the platform. At the end of the performance, write a report on the test performance. Use the analysis report to write the performance status of the platform, and use it to explain and briefly explain the performance test results.After the pressure test, the performance test results of the system are shown in Figure12.Open in figure viewerPowerPointConcurrent testing and stress testing are two important tests of system performance testing.

ConclusionIt is proved that the three secondary development modes of GIS based on AO are compared, and the proposed development solution can effectively solve the problem of landscape design of green city, meet people's demand for green city, make up for the shortcomings of traditional urban landscape system, and improve people's living standards. Urban landscaping system is an important part of urban ecosystem and the main body of natural components in urban ecosystem. It has ecological benefits, social benefits, and economic benefits and has a great impact on urban living environment. Therefore, green space construction has become one of the important contents of urban construction in China. At the same time, the development of GIS and its related technologies (such as database technology and network technology) also promotes the construction and development of urban landscaping system.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Anyang Institute of Technology and Xingtai University.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe labeled dataset used to support the findings of this study is available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Shan P.andSun W.,Research on 3d urban"

"AbstractThe continuous progress in modern medicine is not only the level of medical technology, but also various high-tech medical auxiliary equipment. With the rapid development of hospital information construction, medical equipment plays a very important role in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis observation of the disease. However, the continuous growth of the types and quantity of medical equipment has caused considerable difficulties in the management of hospital equipment. In order to improve the efficiency of medical equipment management in hospital, based on cloud computing and the Internet of Things, this paper develops a comprehensive management system of medical equipment and uses the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm and chicken swarm algorithm to help the system reasonably achieve dynamic task scheduling. The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive intelligent management system to master the procurement, maintenance, and use of all medical equipment in the hospital, so as to maximize the scientific management of medical equipment in the hospital.Scientific Management. It is very necessary to develop a preventive maintenance plan for medical equipment.

When there are 1000 simulated online users, the corresponding time for submitting the equipment maintenance application form is 5123 ms, and the correct rate is 99.4%. On the whole, the medical equipment management information system has excellent performance in stress testing. It not only predicts the initial performance requirements, but also provides a large amount of data support for equipment management and maintenance.1. IntroductionIn recent years, the rapid development of medical technology has made the average medical level of the entire society continue to rise, and various advanced medical equipment have been developed and put on the market [1]. As the number and types of medical equipment purchased by hospitals increase, the maintenance and maintenance requirements for medical equipment are also higher. How to manage and maintain these pieces of medical equipment with a large number of brands and advanced science and technology and give full play to their role in medical treatment is a very important issue for the hospital department managers and maintenance engineers and technicians.

"issue for the hospital department managers and maintenance engineers and technicians. With the continuous expansion of medical equipment in hospitals, the speed of equipment upgrades and updates has accelerated, and the information items for maintenance management have become more and more complicated. The requirements for equipment maintenance management and information retrieval have become higher and higher.In foreign countries, many scholars have conducted large-scale research and discussion on the management of medical equipment. Amerieon et al. conducted a qualitative study on the factors affecting the maintenance and management of medical equipment in military hospitals. He used the framework analysis method to investigate the managers and medical equipment experts of a military area hospital in a targeted manner. Semistructured interviews are used for data analysis and descriptive statistics are used to rank the frequency of many factors affecting medical equipment maintenance management. From the experimental data, equipment management training has a very important proportion. Of course, due to the limited sample data, they have considered the convincing power of the results to a certain extent [2].

"research on rich cases of integrated facility management systems. Networking and the innovation of digital control systems have enabled the integration of different control strategies in the past. These strategies are not only suitable for building systems, but also in the field of medical management. Scientific innovation provides a more powerful mathematical basis for the rational use of various equipment in the hospital. In the future, people should focus on how to correctly understand these data and promote the intelligent scheduling effect of the system [3].With the development of emerging science and technology, domestic hospitals have paid more and more attention to the maintenance and management of medical equipment. Qiang believes that advanced medical equipment is one of the important signs of modern hospital technology. Therefore, the hospital has the responsibility to establish an effective management model and manage the medical equipment to keep it in a good operating condition and ensure the safety of patients. He and his team used a variety of methods such as literature research, questionnaire survey, and data analysis to summarize the problems in the maintenance and management of hospital medical equipment, the development and characteristics of the maintenance management model, and the current situation at home and abroad [4].

"the development and characteristics of the maintenance management model, and the current situation at home and abroad [4]. In the research, he proposed that the use of advanced Internet technology to develop intelligent systems has a high feasibility in the management of medical equipment, but he did not prove its advantages in specific practical research [5].Based on cloud computing and the Internet of Things technology, this paper has launched an in-depth study on the integrated management system of medical equipment. The research is mainly carried out from the following parts: first, this article describes the technologies and methods used in the system development, including cloud computing and task scheduling, IoT intelligent control system, particle swarm algorithm, and chicken swarm optimization algorithm. Then, this article starts with the network structure, software structure, development environment, database, and other aspects to develop a comprehensive medical equipment management system platform. Finally, this article simulates the effect of the system in practical applications and various possible problems from the perspective of the procurement, allocation, maintenance, and use of medical equipment.2.

"Based on Medical Equipment Integrated Management System2.1. Cloud Computing and Task SchedulingCloud computing is an emerging technology model that pays on demand [6]. It can provide people with the resources they need in the shortest time, which is very convenient and fast [7]. Compared with traditional computer technology, the biggest difference of cloud computing is that it is based on virtualization technology [8], using the network as the carrier, and integrating large-scale and scalable computing, storage, data, applications, and other distributed computing resources for collaborative work (the supercomputing model) [9,10].In this environment of explosive growth in the amount of information, more and more industries are beginning to use various Internet emerging technologies to achieve intelligent system optimization and management, and the advancement of cloud computing technology provides a powerful way for large-scale task mobilization (technical support) [11]. In the medical field, the problem information involved is usually diverse and highly specialized. Taking medical equipment management as an example, if you want to develop a system that can realize intelligent management, you cannot do this without the support of cloud computing and the Internet of Things technology. Cloud computing task scheduling is mainly to study how to allocate resources for tasks submitted by users. In other words, it is to allocate multiple independent and diversified tasks to the"
"of cloud computing and the Internet of Things technology. Cloud computing task scheduling is mainly to study how to allocate resources for tasks submitted by users. In other words, it is to allocate multiple independent and diversified tasks to the large-scale virtual resources in the cloud, so as to satisfy all tasks with the highest efficiency (user needs) [12,13].Suppliers of cloud computing platforms pay most attention to the utilization of data resources, energy consumption, and the level of profit during the use of the platform; users pay attention to service quality and cost, no matter from which point of view, task scheduling is shared by people (an important stage of virtual resources) [14]. Its essence is the process of reasonably assigning tasks submitted by users to virtual resources. Therefore, the improvement of algorithm performance in task scheduling is the root of the whole problem [15,16].2.2. Internet of Things Intelligent Control SystemThe Internet of Things connects all items to the Internet through information sensing methods such as radio frequency identification, infrared induction, optical induction, and barcode scanning, so as to achieve information exchange and communication and achieve intelligent identification, positioning, tracking, monitoring, and management [17,18].

Figure1shows a diagram of the IoT system architecture.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointIoT system architecture diagram.As shown in Figure1, the basic system of the Internet of Things can be divided into three parts: perception layer, network layer, and application layer. The perception layer is the foundation of the application and development of the Internet of Things. It is composed of various devices with perception capabilities. It mainly realizes information collection, object recognition, and other perception functions and has the ability to fully perceive the Internet of Things; the network layer integrates various communication networks and the Internet is used to build a collaboratively aware network to optimize and improve the application characteristics of the Internet of Things; the application layer is the fundamental purpose of the development of the Internet of Things, and its role is to combine the industry's informatization needs with the Internet of Things technology to provide different users with, for example, applications in the fields of transportation, security, environment, home furnishing, industry, and military and national defense [19].2.3.

"defense [19].2.3. Particle Swarm Algorithm2.3.1. Basic Particle Swarm AlgorithmIn order to realize the comprehensive management of medical equipment in the system based on cloud computing and the Internet of Things, intelligent algorithms need to be optimized to achieve reasonable task scheduling [20]. The essence of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is to focus on the appropriate value of the target search space and to judge the pros and cons of all individuals in between [21]. Each individual is like an example of movement in the group space and contains two parameters: speedviand positionxi. Set the total number and dimension of examples in the population asm,n, respectively,ωis the inertia weight, andcis the acceleration coefficient, that is, the learning factor. In the process of population global optimization, the speed and position of the example satisfy the formula(1)In the iterative process, the particle swarm optimization algorithm only transmits the information of the optimal solution to other particles and completes the search faster through the particles. This is a significant advantage of particle swarm optimization algorithm, which can minimize the waste of time and improve the search efficiency [22]. Coupled with fewer parameters involved in the particle swarm algorithm, it is easier to implement in actual work. On the other hand, the particle swarm algorithm also has certain shortcomings.

"with fewer parameters involved in the particle swarm algorithm, it is easier to implement in actual work. On the other hand, the particle swarm algorithm also has certain shortcomings. For example, the speed of particles cannot be dynamically adjusted, and it is easy to fall into a local optimal solution, which leads to low convergence accuracy and inability to solve discrete problems and combinatorial optimization (question) [23]. In order to improve these situations, the particle swarm algorithm needs to be improved appropriately.2.3.2. Improved Particle Swarm AlgorithmIn order to solve the problem that the particle swarm algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution and affect the task completion time, this paper combines the adaptive inertial weight and the random factor to better balance the local search and the global search, avoid falling into the local optimal solution, improve global optimization ability, and then obtain a task scheduling scheme with shorter task completion time and lower cost [24].To apply the particle swarm algorithm to the cloud computing task scheduling problem, the particles need to be coded. If there arektasks andtresources, each task corresponds to 1 resource.

The calculation method of the success rate is as follows:(5)Among them,represents the sum of the success values of all particles, andω(t) is the inertia weight during iteration, used to adjust the particle velocity during iteration:(6)Suppose the joint distribution function of random variablex,yisH:R2⟶[0,1], and its marginal distribution function isFx,Fy, respectively. The theorem conforms to the formula(7)For any (u,v) ∈ [0,1]2, the binary Copula function can be defined as(8)Among them, Φ is the standard normal distribution function and Φpis the joint distribution function of two-dimensional normal variables [25].

"a certain correlation, we can define that they conform to(9)By comparing the fitness of each particle with the global optimal value, the position state of the particle can be described more accurately [26]. By refining the particle state, a more accurate success value can be obtained, and the success rate of the particle can be further improved, thereby improving the adaptability of the inertia weight and effectively avoiding the particle from falling into the local optimum early in the optimization process [27,28].2.4. Chicken Flock Optimization Algorithm2.4.1. Basic Chicken Optimization AlgorithmChicken flock optimization algorithm (CSO) is a bionic algorithm generated around the hierarchy of chicken flocks [29]. By simulating the living habits and hierarchy of the entire chicken flock, the entire chicken flock is divided into several groups, and there is competition between groups, which effectively reduces the time for the algorithm to perform tasks and can solve problems more quickly; and there are three members of rooster, hen, and chicken in each group. Members of different species have following relationships and competition relationships, and members of the same species also have competitive relationships. This hierarchical behavior within the group can improve the algorithm's global search capability and the efficiency of finding the optimal solution, so that the algorithm can efficiently solve practical problems [30,31].Set the number of roosters, hens, chicks,"
"behavior within the group can improve the algorithm's global search capability and the efficiency of finding the optimal solution, so that the algorithm can efficiently solve practical problems [30,31].Set the number of roosters, hens, chicks, and mother hens in the flock to beNr,Nh,Nc,  andNm, respectively; then, the position update formula of the roosters, hens, and chicks satisfies(10)The advantage of the chicken flock optimization algorithm is that multiple groups can greatly reduce the probability of the algorithm searching for the optimal position and reduce the task scheduling time, and there is a competitive relationship between various groups and individuals, which is beneficial to task allocation. For load balancing, improve the quality of service [32]. However, there are three types of individuals in the algorithm: rooster, hen, and chicken. According to the characteristics of the flock's activities, the leading rooster will inevitably affect the trajectory of the hen and the chicken [33]. If the position of the head chicken is not the optimal position, the algorithm will fall into a local optimum; it is difficult for the hens and chicks that follow to jump out at this time, so in order to preserve the advantages of the algorithm and apply it to task scheduling, the algorithm must be optimized [34].2.4.2.

Improved Chicken Optimization AlgorithmConsidering that, in the chicken swarm optimization algorithm, the chicken will follow the hen's action, and the hen will follow the lead of the rooster, which will easily lead to the problem of local optimal solution in the calculation process [35]. Therefore, according to the characteristics of chaotic perturbation traversing individuals, perturbation is added to the population to reduce the premature phenomenon caused by blind following. The disturbance formula satisfies(11)The improved chicken position update formula satisfies(12)Among them,ωrepresents the coefficient that the chicken learns by itself andFrepresents the following coefficient of the chicken following the hen foraging. From the experimental results, the improved chicken flock optimization algorithm effectively reduces the local optimal problem caused by the chicken blindly following the hen.3.

This article aims to design a set of real-time information management system for the current state of medical equipment. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the overall requirements of the system before the start of the experiment and to fully understand the functional requirements required by the current medical equipment management, in order to achieve more targeted system design.3.2.

In order to reduce the process of medical equipment procurement, this article adds a supplier management module and an equipment procurement management module to the medical equipment integrated management system. Figure3shows the statistics on the consumption of medical equipment in the hospital.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointStatistics on the consumption of medical equipment in the hospital.It can be seen from Figure3that, except for some large-scale high-end medical equipment that can be reused for many years, the hospital consumes a large amount of disposable medical equipment every day, including medical diagnostic equipment, treatment equipment, and various auxiliary equipment. As the inventory data of medical equipment is in a constantly changing state, it is difficult to accurately monitor the consumption of all medical equipment and replenish the inventory in a timely manner if it is manually recorded by management personnel.

The medical equipment maintenance application module is mainly designed for departments. Each department is assigned an administrator who is responsible for the medical equipment maintenance management application and acceptance of the undergraduate room. After the department administrator registers the system, the system administrator assigns the corresponding authority. After the department administrator logs in to the system, he can inquire about the maintenance of the equipment in the undergraduate room in daily situations, such as the equipment being repaired, repair progress, past repair records, and repair details of these medical equipment.In order to further grasp the use effect of the medical equipment maintenance template, this paper conducts a system performance test on it. System performance test is divided into two parts: system stress test and system compatibility test. The system stress test is mainly used to test the concurrent operation of multiuser login system.

"test is divided into two parts: system stress test and system compatibility test. The system stress test is mainly used to test the concurrent operation of multiuser login system. The test system can support multiuser access. During the testing phase, a large number of users cannot be found for simultaneous access system, so this article uses a testing tool for stress testing. The result of the system stress test is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointStatistical results of system stress test.It can be seen from Figure6that when there are 100 simultaneous online simulated users, the corresponding time for submitting the equipment maintenance application form is 1228 ms, and the correct rate is 99.8%; when there are 1000 simultaneous online simulated users, the equipment maintenance application form is submitted. The corresponding time is 5123 ms, and the correct rate is 99.4%. Comprehensively observing the engineer′s handling of maintenance reports, maintenance equipment inquiries, and information reminders, it can be found that as the number of simulated users increases, the corresponding time of the system is improving, while the accuracy rate has decreased. Taking into account the limited number of people using the system at the same time in the hospital in actual work, maintaining a correct rate of over 99% is already a relatively good performance for the system.If we can understand the causes of medical equipment failure, we can further promote the"
"using the system at the same time in the hospital in actual work, maintaining a correct rate of over 99% is already a relatively good performance for the system.If we can understand the causes of medical equipment failure, we can further promote the hospital preventive maintenance plan smoothly, so that the equipment has a longer service life. This article takes the monitor as an example and combines various data in the medical equipment management system to explore scientific and reasonable preventive maintenance methods for the monitor.

"a relatively high number of failures; among the equipment failures, the number of occurrences is relatively high. It is the blood pressure module, fan failure, and encoder failure. Through data analysis, it is possible to provide reference opinions on the quantity and quality of the purchase of monitor accessories every year, and it is recommended to maintain a corresponding number of vulnerable module accessories for equipment failures, so as to effectively prevent long-term downtime from affecting clinical work and improve equipment utilization. Fan failure is mainly due to fan aging and dust accumulation. For machines with poor heat dissipation, replace the fan and clean up internal dust in time. Encoder failure is the failure of the keys. Replace the encoder with a new one in time for the machine with key problems. Since most of the monitoring consumables are plastic products, they will harden and become unusable if stored for too long.4.3. Medical Equipment Management Based on Cloud Computing and Internet of ThingsThe integrated management of medical equipment is essentially a dynamic task scheduling problem, and the research of task scheduling has always been a hot issue of scientific research in the cloud environment. The problem of cloud computing task scheduling is the process of matching different tasks from different users to cloud computing virtual resources in a reasonable manner through scheduling requirements under certain constraints to meet customer needs."
"The problem of cloud computing task scheduling is the process of matching different tasks from different users to cloud computing virtual resources in a reasonable manner through scheduling requirements under certain constraints to meet customer needs. In order to meet the needs of the times, this paper appropriately improves the heuristic intelligent task scheduling algorithm--particle swarm algorithm and chicken swarm optimization algorithm--to improve the accuracy of the scheduling of medical equipment in the system. Figure8shows the optimization time statistics of particle swarm optimization when the number of tasks is 50.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointTime statistics for particle swarm optimization task optimization.It can be seen from Figure8that when the number of tasks is 50, the task completion time of the particle swarm algorithm will fluctuate differently as the number of iterations changes. Compared with the other three types of particle swarm algorithms, the improved EPSO algorithm in this paper has significantly shorter optimization time. When the number of tasks is low, the gap is relatively small, but as the number of tasks continues to grow, the time efficiency advantage of the improved particle swarm algorithm will become more and more significant.

"algorithm will become more and more significant. Figure9shows a comparison chart of the fitness value of the improved chicken flock algorithm.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison chart of the improved CSO algorithm fitness value.It can be seen from Figure9that when the number of tasks is the same, the fitness function value of the improved ECSO algorithm in this paper is higher than the original two types of CSO algorithm, which shows that the degree of load balancing is better. When the fitness function value is close to 1, the longest time it takes for the task to complete is closer to the total time for task completion, and the more balanced the task allocation is when performing scheduling. On the whole, the improvement of the chicken flock algorithm can effectively improve the utilization rate of the system and the efficiency of task execution, so that the system can be better applied to practical problems, and the scientific management and scheduling of medical equipment in the hospital can be realized.5. ConclusionsThis article analyzes the purchase, maintenance, management, and query of medical equipment based on the integrated management system. Through multiple stress tests on the system, the results show that the medical equipment management information system designed and implemented in this paper has excellent effects in terms of system reflection sensitivity, system compatibility, and system stability and fully realizes the initial performance of"
"show that the medical equipment management information system designed and implemented in this paper has excellent effects in terms of system reflection sensitivity, system compatibility, and system stability and fully realizes the initial performance of the prediction.Claim. In this paper, according to the system function modules, the supplier management, equipment purchase management, equipment maintenance management, statistical query, and system management functions were tested in turn. From the results, it can be seen that each module can play a good effect. Due to the full use of the advantages of the Internet of Things and cloud computing task scheduling, the medical equipment management system developed in this paper not only reduces the implementation cost, but also effectively reduces the cost of hospital use. From the perspective of the supplier, it is also beneficial to increase economic benefits.When scheduling tasks, whether it is time or cost, the more tasks there are, the greater the difference between the scheduling scheme obtained by the improved particle swarm algorithm and the scheduling schemes of the other three algorithms, and the trend of EPSO algorithm change is relatively stable. This is because when the number of tasks is small, each algorithm performs small-scale search, which cannot reflect the advantages of adaptive inertial weight balancing local and global search, and the recognition of individual optimal solutions and global optimal solutions"
"the number of tasks is small, each algorithm performs small-scale search, which cannot reflect the advantages of adaptive inertial weight balancing local and global search, and the recognition of individual optimal solutions and global optimal solutions in the particle optimization process relationship. As the number of tasks increases, the inertial weight adaptation and the correlation of random factors have a more significant impact on the particle optimization process, which can better balance the global and local search, thereby obtaining a better scheduling plan. When the fitness function value is close to 1, the longest time it takes for the task to complete is closer to the total time for task completion and the more balanced the task allocation is when performing scheduling. In the case of the same number of tasks, the fitness function value of the improved ECSO algorithm in this paper is higher than the original two types of CSO algorithm, which shows that the degree of load balancing is better.In the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, medical equipment has become an indispensable auxiliary means. Whether the medical equipment is advanced or not represents the level of hospital diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it is very important to carry out effective and scientific management of hospital medical equipment.

"it is very important to carry out effective and scientific management of hospital medical equipment. Judging from the experimental results, the research in this paper has achieved certain results, but limited by various conditions, there are still some shortcomings. In the follow-up research, more thoughts can be made from the following aspects: (1) Further define the judgment standard of load balancing in task scheduling in the cloud computing environment. (2) In the development process of the medical equipment integrated management system, some modules' functions are not complete enough. (3) It is necessary to propose a multifaceted fitness function for the fusion algorithm according to the requirements of task scheduling. (4) Take advantage of the information age and actively explore a comprehensive management system for medical equipment based on mobile terminals.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Science Research Funding Project JYTJCRW2020089 of Liaoning Provincial Education Department in 2020, Research on Information Sharing of Regional Medical Alliance for Major Diseases Based on Cloud Computing.
