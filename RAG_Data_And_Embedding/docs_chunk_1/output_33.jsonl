"without writing code. Enterprise financial information system is a complex database, which contains many contents, the most important of which are administrative business processing, enterprise asset allocation, and management information system [4]. The three parts constitute the most important part of the enterprise information system. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation provides a multilayer end-to-end application system architecture, as shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe system plans to adopt BS structure and develop the system by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, an efficient and advanced system development tool. The background database uses Microsoft SQL Server 2005, an open-source database with high security and good portability, and uses ADO.Net database access technology to access the background database [5]. All technologies are currently mature mainstream technologies, and there are many successful cases. Members of the project team are familiar with the application of technology, and relevant personnel in the enterprise have a considerable understanding of the application of MIS. Therefore, technically, it is completely feasible to develop the system. The design method and mode of ERP financial management information system are also based on this.

"management information system are also based on this. In the structure of MVC, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation architecture is the most common application. MVC is especially suitable for a large number of client access data and multiple interactive web applications. A workflow architecture can carry out more process control, and the architecture of design pattern can solve the application in system design, which is also very helpful [6], because the structure of MVC is widely used in the architecture of interactive applications. The client layer, show layer, business layer, and information layer are the three levels that make up the MVC design in view of fuzzy comprehensive appraisal. Each layer's functions play a vital role. Figure2depicts the structure.Open in figure viewerPowerPointMVC stands for model view controller, and it is a software design model. The MVC (model view controller) software architecture paradigm is used to construct user description diagrams. It splits an application program into three parts: model, view, and controller, all of which are interconnected [7]. In MVC architecture, the model represents the information from the inside of the information, and the controller proposes or accepts the methods from the user. In general, the difference from other software patterns is that MVC architecture represents the \"core of the solution\" problem and allows it to adapt to the development process of each system [8].

In general, the difference from other software patterns is that MVC architecture represents the \"core of the solution\" problem and allows it to adapt to the development process of each system [8]. In the current environment of Internet development, based on the specific MVC architecture, it is usually developed in the mode of JSP + servlet + JavaBean, as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe B/S three-tier structural model is used in the system. The B/S (browser/server) structure consists of a browser and a server. It has risen in tandem with the advancement of Internet technology. The WWW browser is used to create the user interface. The majority of transaction logic is implemented on the server, despite the fact that some transaction logic is implemented in the browser. It is a modification or enhancement of the C/S structure. However, both B/S and C/S have their own advantages and disadvantages. The following is a simple comparison between them [9,10]. The business logic layer is mainly composed of business object class and data persistence class.

Generally, the abstract processing of business objects is carried out by logical operation, and the processed structure is summarized and summarized in the form of database to form a permanent storage platform, which is convenient for the perfect final processing of data results [11]. Struts controller acts as a bridge between WCB view and servlet. The servlet request is sent to the request processor through the controller, where the WCB view is an instance of the action class. Web applications can be embodied through different use objects, such as action objects. After sending the instruction request for processing tasks, the controller can easily obtain the request processing results through struts-config.xml file mapping. Furthermore, MVC-based Internet applications can accomplish very effective partition control, simplify program development procedures, and save time and money by incorporating the following aspects: it is easy to design and validate HTML form processing algorithms; the system uses a B/S three-tier structural paradigm.

B/S and C/S, on the other hand, each have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The following is a simple comparison between them [12]. In order to increase the timeliness of financial data, the network technology is used. From the logical structure, the presentation layer, business layer, customer layer, and database layer constitute the core application system of the whole model, respectively. In this structure, the presentation layer is mainly used for business processing. The presentation layer will respond to the processing instructions sent by the client and display the processing results in the client layer. The client layer is mainly the program module of human-computer interaction application. The business layer is responsible for the implementation of the whole processing program, including business processing and data collection and storage.

Function Structure Optimization of Financial Information Management System SoftwareThe system initialization module completes the initialization setting module of the parameters of the whole information system to provide technical support for subsequent system recovery. The system initialization template can reduce the user's later setting time, and the whole parameter setting can be set by the system administrator at the same time. Therefore, the module can be used as the initial stage of the whole system and also as the later maintenance stage of the whole system [15]. It plays an important role in the whole system. According to the permissions of different users, the system administrator can set the forks of different staff to use the system and initialize the common functions in the system. This module can be used as the security module of the whole system to limit the viewing permission of users, so as to ensure the confidentiality of information and meet the confidentiality specifications of enterprises [16].

The A/C set management module can input financial data from a company's operation in real time, based on the company's operation status, in order to offer data support for the implementation of subsequent functions. This module serves as the system's database. The financial data input of this module provides the data for the entire system. A/C set is the key function module of the entire system, as it contains financial management data. Figure4shows the system functional structure requirements.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall design adds the main functions such as financial analysis, cost accounting, and system management and transmits data through the user layer, system layer, and data layer. In the voucher management process, the corresponding vouchers are processed in a standardized business process according to the basic requirements of accounting, mainly for entry and approval [17]. After meeting the requirements, the program will automatically generate voucher reports according to the status of the entered vouchers and make a comprehensive summary of voucher management, so as to understand the overall situation of voucher management in detail and lay a good foundation for the next financial process.

"the next financial process. The overall design of the system is shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe data layer, middle layer, and display layer of the underlying database interface are all used in the design of the financial information management system. The data layer is where financial management service processing information, such as financial data and asset data, is stored. It can do query, modification, and maintenance activities, as well as storage operations, and improve data management efficiency [18-20]. The financial management intermediate layer connects the database to the business logic layer for access ports, establishes a generally stable high-level application environment, and enhances system scalability. The system presentation layer and the data presentation layer are both primarily presented in the browser. The data management module adopted by enterprises is mainly realized through information table, including enterprise information table, management information table, and data change information.

It very well might be isolated into five areas, as per the program structure generally utilized in the present society: association network, bookkeeping exchange handling, financial management, financial navigation, and financial manager. The financial information management framework executes factual control of financial information as per the general course of financial information control in the genuine effort process. How much information that can be dealt with in the standard financial information management framework's risk appraisal system is restricted. To gauge information risk, just the examining study approach is utilized, disregarding the information connection between information.

Realization of Financial Information ManagementIn light of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the financial information management framework examined and made takes on the construction of an organized financial information management framework. The application layer of the information interaction system is aided by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation structure. It mainly realizes the common functional modules, account book management, voucher management, system setting, and so on. The system middle layer can exist as a compatibility layer. The financial database is used to store data information. According to the set financial processing formula, the system automatically performs statistical accounting, accounting, and project accounting, and the system can also automatically classify bookkeeping vouchers, financial statements, etc. The functional structure of the financial information management system designed in this paper is shown in the figure.

For example, in the age of big data, a business might use fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to manage its capital. It not just controls the components from the financial program information management part; however, it likewise examines the significant viewpoints from the field of financial choice help control to kill program management issues: create a financial information dynamic risk counteraction and control framework with a program computerization association.

At the point when assets are required for ventures or designs in the organization, experts should foster financial management designs from the get-go and execute following examination of financial dynamic items in light of the risk anticipation and control needs that have been for starters evaluated. The financial choice help risk control segment should test the exactness of the information in the articulation once all information joins in the financial dynamic part which is likely to risk control. At the point when there are issues in the information in the articulation, risk anticipation and financial information fix ought to be done immediately. The consistent hub of the financial framework is considered by the evaluation model. While utilizing this hub to trade information or execute directions to the framework, it dynamically grasps the conduct attributes of framework equipment, programming, and administrators, and the correspondence connected between hubs is the manner in which financial information communicates, delineating the information collaboration relationship.

The performance test of ERP financial management system mainly adopts the pressure test method, and the model used in the test is still the step-by-step pressure mode. Start 10 concurrent users every 30 seconds, and the total number of users is 200. Implement user login and logout, and repeatedly perform login request operation according to the set time interval. The pressure curve is shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointBased on the above detection results, it is easy to conclude that, in the same environment, the system in this study has higher risk identification accuracy than the traditional technique. None of the system's use cases failed, but all succeeded. This shows that the performance of the financial information management system can meet the expected design requirements. After testing the overall performance of the system, the system has been comprehensively tested to prove that the design is effective and reasonable and can meet the system design objectives and expected visits.

In view of the poor time division of gap management and the small value of interest rate sensitivity gap, there may even be individual wrong information. Its sensitivity gap ignores option risk and interest rate difference at the same time. The management method in this paper is simple and intuitive. It can directly observe the interest rate in each time period and understand the sensitive types of financial management and the size of risk at any time.

"AbstractProjects in the construction industry are becoming increasingly large and complex, with construction technologies, methods, and the like developing rapidly. Various different types of information are generated by construction projects. Especially, a construction phase requires the input of many resources and generates a diverse set of information. While a variety of IT techniques are being deployed for information management during the construction phase, measures to create databases of such information and to link these various different types of information together are still insufficient. As such, this study aims to suggest a construction information database system based on BIM technology to enable the comprehensive management of site information generated during the construction phase. This study analyzed the information generated from construction sites and proposed a categorization system for structuring the generated information, along with a database model for storing such structured information. Through such efforts, it was confirmed that such a database system can be used for accumulating and using construction information; it is believed that, in the future, the continual accumulation and management of construction information will allow for corporate-level accumulation of knowledge as opposed to the individual accumulation of know-how.1.

"construction information will allow for corporate-level accumulation of knowledge as opposed to the individual accumulation of know-how.1. IntroductionProjects in the construction industry are becoming increasingly large and complex, with new construction technologies, methods, and the like developing rapidly. Furthermore, owners of construction projects are making increasingly diverse sets of demands while all related laws and regulations undergo rapid change. As a result of such advancements in construction technology and the growing complexity of the construction industry, efficient management of the diverse information generated from construction projects is becoming increasingly necessary. In particular, since the construction phase is the phase where the building begins to take shape based on the blueprints, a successful project requires comprehensive management of large quantities of information to allow the construction phase to succeed [1].Due to the importance of information management, the construction industry utilizes a diverse array of IT techniques, and various studies and methods such as CIC (Computer Integrated Construction), CALS (Continuous Acquisition and Life-cycle Support), and PMIS (Project Management Information System) exist in order to comprehensively manage the information that is generated during the course of construction. However, as a result of examining these studies, it is difficult to utilize the information due to the fact that the"
"Information System) exist in order to comprehensively manage the information that is generated during the course of construction. However, as a result of examining these studies, it is difficult to utilize the information due to the fact that the information generated in the construction industry is collected as one information such as e-documents. They merely focus on the visualization of data and are therefore insufficient in terms of establishing connections within the data [2-4].BIM (building information modeling) exists to resolve the problems associated with construction information management techniques. While it can be said that BIM is a technique that uses a three-dimensional parametric modeling technique to consolidate the information generated during the construction phase into a database so as to facilitate connections between data points, it is currently used mainly for making various assessments and analyses that use 3D models such as interference assessment, sunshine analysis, viewing area analysis, and energy analysis. That is, while BIM is being effectively used for analyses that use 3D models, it is not being used for construction information management through the consolidation of construction information and database building. This may be attributed to the insufficiency of database systems for BIM information management and the lack of means to effectively link figure information and nonfigure information [5].As such, this study proposes a means of"
"and database building. This may be attributed to the insufficiency of database systems for BIM information management and the lack of means to effectively link figure information and nonfigure information [5].As such, this study proposes a means of effectively linking figure information, which is planning information, and nonfigure information, which is construction information, as well as a BIM-based database system for construction information, in order to facilitate effective accumulation of construction information and enhanced information management. In order to achieve the purposes of this study, analysis of the information generated during the construction phase is used to propose an information categorization system that orders uncategorized information along with a database system that gathers these structured data.2. Preliminary Considerations2.1. Problems of Documented Information from Construction SitesConstruction sites manage information generated during the construction phase by documenting such information [6]. However, these documents are numerous and diverse and often contain much overlapping information [7]. Some representative examples of documents generated by construction sites are daily labor reports and safety reports. Labor reports contain general information concerning the project such as the name of the construction project, date, weather, and temperature, in addition to construction-related information such as construction progress details,"
"and safety reports. Labor reports contain general information concerning the project such as the name of the construction project, date, weather, and temperature, in addition to construction-related information such as construction progress details, contractor output details, current state of equipment, and current state of material inputs and special information such as cautionary notes concerning the work. Safety reports contain general information such as the name of the construction project, date, and weather; work information such as the details of work to be done on that date; safety information such as safety inspection records, safety training details, and site manager safety inspection details; and special information such as cautionary notes concerning safety and any special notes.Daily labor reports and safety reports contain overlapping general information: the name of the construction project, date, weather, and details of the work to be done on the date, and so on. As such, while the information generated from construction sites is managed in the form of various different documents, the information contained therein is connected to each other and often overlaps.However, since the documents generated from construction sites are handled only as individual documents, it is difficult to use the information contained in these documents in a consolidated manner. Furthermore, since the documented information generated by a construction site is archived onsite at a"
"sites are handled only as individual documents, it is difficult to use the information contained in these documents in a consolidated manner. Furthermore, since the documented information generated by a construction site is archived onsite at a document archive as physical documents or as computer files in a format chosen by the person responsible for preparing each document, the reality is that it is difficult to search through and use the information contained in each document.A review of previous studies on the management of construction documents shows that, from the 1980s to 1990s, the main focus was on foundational research on EDI to digitize the construction industry so as to enhance the efficiency of construction work and the construction industry overall, in addition to foundational research on EDMS to comprehensively manage such information [8]. Furthermore, from the late 1990s to early 2000s, research efforts were focused on sharing documents and data, as well as web-based information sharing using XML and EDI [9-14], while research from the late 2000s onwards focused on searching through accumulated information and the effective use of data [15-17].Analysis of previous studies has confirmed that, while current methods of construction information management propose measures to enhance the effectiveness of work analysis and/or document management in order to improve the efficiency of certain tasks or document exchanges, there is a lack of research on the management"
"of construction information management propose measures to enhance the effectiveness of work analysis and/or document management in order to improve the efficiency of certain tasks or document exchanges, there is a lack of research on the management and use of the overlapping information contained in documents generated onsite. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that only those in charge of preparing the documents accurately comprehend the information contained within and that insufficient management of documented information limits the search, use, and consistency of information. As such, it is necessary to devise a systematic methodology for gathering the documented information that contains most of the information concerning construction sites so as to facilitate effective accumulation of construction information and to improve its usefulness and consistency, and in order to increase the usefulness of this accumulated documented information, it can be said that it is necessary to visualize both structural information and linked information such as BIM, as it is useful for direct searches on, and the use of, documented information.2.2. BIM for Construction Information ManagementBIM is based on Eastman's Building Description System from the 1970s and is developing into a technique that incorporates the concept of a virtual building that enables the consolidation and analysis of information through 3D modeling, from the planning stages all the way to maintenance and"
"System from the 1970s and is developing into a technique that incorporates the concept of a virtual building that enables the consolidation and analysis of information through 3D modeling, from the planning stages all the way to maintenance and repairs.Some of the advantages of BIM include its ability to allow for the accumulation of construction information through model data, which in turn allows for easy standardization and management of knowledge assets, as well as its ability to allow for data accumulation and management through a 3D model, contributing to communication between the parties involved in the construction, along with sharing and procuring materials between them, thus improving cooperation and contributing to effective information management. Furthermore, it establishes an automated environment for information management, reducing the resources needed for the preparation of drawings, quantity calculations, and various other aspects of construction management.Among the studies on BIM, a system with the aforementioned advantages, a review of those involving onsite information management through BIM shows the following: the study by Dawood et al. [18] suggested a resource-data-based user interface and database system to combine AutoCAD and MS Project for the development of a consolidated database to allow for 4D/VR process simulation, while Caldas et al. [19] suggested a data link system for connecting documented information and model data that is based on"
"system to combine AutoCAD and MS Project for the development of a consolidated database to allow for 4D/VR process simulation, while Caldas et al. [19] suggested a data link system for connecting documented information and model data that is based on automatically categorizing documents using the IFC file system and a systematic analysis of MasterFormat to link them to BIM, thereby suggesting a linked framework between 2D models and documented information. Eastman et al. [20] suggested an information conversion system for structural information compatibility between the IFC file system and the standard American BIM system to facilitate smooth information sharing through the BIM model. Liu and Issa [21] considered a measure for smooth data compatibility between BIM model data and maintenance system data in order to apply planning-stage BIM model data to the maintenance system in order to enhance the usefulness of BIM during the maintenance and management phase. In order to apply BIM information to China's bidding system, Ma et al. [22] developed a process map and algorithm for linking BIM model data and the information needed for bidding based on an algorithmic analysis of the bidding system and verified the usefulness of said process map and algorithm, while Lin [23] suggested a BIM-based system for the management of construction knowledge during the construction phase that would enable the storage of information relevant to the construction phase using the BIM"
"of said process map and algorithm, while Lin [23] suggested a BIM-based system for the management of construction knowledge during the construction phase that would enable the storage of information relevant to the construction phase using the BIM model.Previous studies on BIM-based information management mainly focused on information compatibility between each phase of a construction project. For example, the studies focused on how information must be exchanged in order to utilize design phase BIM data for the structural BIM or the facilities and equipment BIM. Also, while previous studies were focused on the life cycle of buildings and thereby suggested frameworks for data compatibility and exchange throughout all of the phases of construction, they were rather insufficient in terms of realizing an actual, detailed system while also lacking research on database establishment and information consolidation for data accumulation and management during the construction phase, which is the phase that generates the most information among all of the phases of construction.3. Measure for the Establishment of a BIM-Based Construction DatabaseIt can be said that effective accumulation and management of documented information at a construction site exert a significant influence on efficiently progressing construction and accumulating construction know-how. As such, this study suggests a database system for construction information to manage such construction information. A BIM-based"
"site exert a significant influence on efficiently progressing construction and accumulating construction know-how. As such, this study suggests a database system for construction information to manage such construction information. A BIM-based construction database will rearrange and accumulate documented information generated at construction sites through a categorization system and will link these data with the BIM model to enable the utilization of construction information. The overall structure of such a BIM-based construction database is depicted in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBIM-based construction database system.The BIM-based construction database system as depicted in Figure1shows that the documents generated at construction sites as shown in Part A are each prepared by the document preparer, and such documents can be rearranged through a categorization system designed to categorize such information as shown in Part B, and then the rearranged documented site information is stored in the form of a database as shown in Part C. Such stored information is managed by linking it with the BIM model as shown in Part D, and the construction data that are linked to the BIM model and stored can then be used by construction managers, and so on, as shown in Part E.To explain this construction database system in more detail, if, for example, among the various site documents shown in Part A of Figure1, the documents in question are daily work reports, then data"
"by construction managers, and so on, as shown in Part E.To explain this construction database system in more detail, if, for example, among the various site documents shown in Part A of Figure1, the documents in question are daily work reports, then data such as the information structure (type of information), general information on the project, general information on the construction, information related to construction work, and space information are included. Figure2depicts the data contained in the documents generated at construction sites.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation within site-generated documents (example: daily work report).Such site-generated documents each contain diverse arrays of information, and since such information often overlaps with those contained in other documents, it is necessary to comprehensively manage such construction information in order to enhance consistency.The information contained within site-generated documents needs to be categorized and gathered in accordance with the categorization system shown in Part B of Figure1in order to properly structure the information. For this purpose, this study has categorized documented information using the space breakdown structure (SBS) and the information breakdown structure (IBS), which were established through prior research. Figure3depicts the concept of categorizing the information contained in daily construction journals through said categorization systems.Figure 3Open in figure"
"and the information breakdown structure (IBS), which were established through prior research. Figure3depicts the concept of categorizing the information contained in daily construction journals through said categorization systems.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointApplication of categorization systems (example: daily work report).The categorization of the information contained in daily work report facilitates the categorization of construction journals themselves through the IBS into the categories of \"Documented Information--Building Plan\"; more specifically, project information, general construction information, and space information can be categorized and included as project elements by the SBS, while general construction information can be linked to the project elements of the SBS and thereby categorized into \"Project--General Construction Information (date, weather, temperature, etc.).\" Furthermore, space information can be categorized and stored using the Space-Based System.Documented information that is categorized in this manner is stored in the database shown in Part C of Figure1, and the stored information can be stored in either the categorized documented information format or in an electronic document format for use. Figure4is an abstract depiction of the process in which construction data categorized through the categorization system are stored in the database.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of storing categorized construction data in a"
"format for use. Figure4is an abstract depiction of the process in which construction data categorized through the categorization system are stored in the database.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of storing categorized construction data in a database.Categorized data can be reordered into new data combinations from the database, increasing the usefulness of the information. Furthermore, electronic document information, which is stored in an electronic document format, is saved as is, allowing for the accumulation of nonstandard documented information in the database as well, offering a solution to the problems arising from document storage and management at construction sites (such as destruction or loss of documented information).Documented information saved in the database is managed by connecting it to the BIM model, as shown in Part D of Figure1. The construction information database is linked based on the Space-Based System and is matched 1 : 1 with the individual Objects of the BIM model, allowing for the storage of construction information through the BIM model.There are various methods for linking the BIM model and the Space-Based System for construction information, including a method where links are established through the individual IDs within the IFC files of the BIM model, a method using the Object IDs provided by the BIM software that is used, a method where the Layer ID of the Object is used, and so on. Figure5depicts the concept of linking the"
"established through the individual IDs within the IFC files of the BIM model, a method using the Object IDs provided by the BIM software that is used, a method where the Layer ID of the Object is used, and so on. Figure5depicts the concept of linking the BIM model with the construction information.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointMethods of linking the BIM model with construction information.Once the BIM model and the construction information database are connected, construction information can be accumulated through each object of the BIM model as shown in Part E of Figure1, and construction information can be verified through the BIM model. For example, when fractures form on a wall, the construction information, general construction information, and so on of the relevant framework can be checked through the Spaced-Based System and the Information-Based System of the relevant construction project. Figure6depicts an example of using the BIM-based construction information database.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of using the BIM-based construction information database.By gathering information on the building process, such a construction information database can be used to manage the construction information history for the building; in addition, storing the documents generated during the building process using this model allows for easy verification of construction information during the building process, and in particular, should claims or other issues"
"history for the building; in addition, storing the documents generated during the building process using this model allows for easy verification of construction information during the building process, and in particular, should claims or other issues arise, it can assist with the accumulation and management of claim-related documents through the BIM model.4. Establishment of a BIM-Based Construction Information Database System4.1. Construction Information Database SystemIn order to gather documented information on construction by connecting structural and nonstructural information, the BIM-based construction information database can be categorized into a space category, site information, work information, and a database for onsite documents, and such a database gathers information by interlinking the space-categorized database with the site information database and the work information database through space category codes, with the space-categorized database at the core. Figure7is a conceptual depiction of the interlinking relationship of a BIM-based construction information database system.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointBIM-based database system for construction information.In the case of documented information generated onsite that is difficult to structure into database form, the document itself can be transformed into an electronic document for management. That is, as shown in Part D of Figure7, onsite documents are stored in the form of electronic documents,"
"generated onsite that is difficult to structure into database form, the document itself can be transformed into an electronic document for management. That is, as shown in Part D of Figure7, onsite documents are stored in the form of electronic documents, and by incorporating space information into such electronic documents through the space-based categorization system, the documents themselves can be linked with structural information and managed.By using this concept to gather both standardized and nonstandardized data from the documents generated at the construction site, it is possible to establish a system where the information generated at construction sites is gathered. Furthermore, in the case of nonstandardized information, the very documents containing such information can be stored as electronic documents, thus allowing for connections between all documented information pertinent to the construction, which in turn enables the review of all documented information involved with a given building's framework through linkage with the BIM model.4.2. Designing a Construction Information DatabaseThe construction information database consists of a space-categorized DB, site information DB, work information DB, and a DB for site-generated documents. Figure8depicts the linkage between construction information database and each data table.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointConnection relationships of the construction information database.When a construction site generates"
"site-generated documents. Figure8depicts the linkage between construction information database and each data table.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointConnection relationships of the construction information database.When a construction site generates construction journal information, the information that can be stored as data (Part A of Figure8) is entered into the system, and such entered data are stored into the site information database (Part E of Figure8) and the work information database (Part F of Figure8), and information that is difficult to be stored as data is transformed into an electronic document and stored on the onsite document database (Part C of Figure8). Such entered site information is organized according to the form and subject by the information categorization system (Part B of Figure8). The data tables of each database are linked based on the space categorization code, thereby linking the pertinent Object with the details of the work, site information, and so on. For example, Part D of Figure8shows the data tables included in the space-categorized database and includes data from Levels 1 to 6 of the space-based categorization system, and the project code information (SBS Lv 1) can be included in the site information database as shown in Part E of Figure8, thus allowing for management with links to space information. And Part C of Figure8shows a site-document database for the storage of electronic documents by linking the electronic document form of"
"site information database as shown in Part E of Figure8, thus allowing for management with links to space information. And Part C of Figure8shows a site-document database for the storage of electronic documents by linking the electronic document form of construction site documents with the site code, the category information according to the information categorization system, and the space-based categorization system, while Part F of Figure8depicts a work information database that includes information on work schedules, information on workers, information on the details of the work, and categorization systems such as WBS and CBS.5. Scenario-Based Application of the Construction Information DatabaseIn this section, an attempt was made to test the effectiveness of the developed BIM-based construction information database. Since it is difficult to actually apply the construction information database to an actual construction site, an attempt was made to assess the possibility of implementing the database system based on a scenario. For this, based on the applied scenarios with respect to the storage and use of documents, an attempt was made to assess the possibility of implementing the construction information database through a process comparison between applying traditional processes and applying the information management database, thereby determining the effectiveness of the construction information database. In addition, the details of applying the construction information"
"a process comparison between applying traditional processes and applying the information management database, thereby determining the effectiveness of the construction information database. In addition, the details of applying the construction information database were proposed. The scenarios in which the construction information database was to be applied were designed around the accumulation and storage of documented information generated by construction sites and the claims that arise after the completion of the construction project.The scenarios for assessing the construction information database consisted of two phases: first, the process of managing the documents generated by construction sites and second, using stored information to determine the relevant documents in the case of a claim. The first phase, which is the process of managing the documents generated by construction sites, consisted of the steps in Parts A to D of Figure1and was implemented based on a scenario where the documents generated at construction sites were stored in the form of processed information and electronic documents that replicate the original documents. The second phase, which involved determining relevant documents for claims, consisted of the steps in Part E of Figure1and was a scenario involving the process of determining relevant documented information.5.1. Scenario 1 (Management of Site-Generated Documents)Scenario 1 was a scenario concerning the accumulation and management of"
"of the steps in Part E of Figure1and was a scenario involving the process of determining relevant documented information.5.1. Scenario 1 (Management of Site-Generated Documents)Scenario 1 was a scenario concerning the accumulation and management of documents that are generated by construction sites, and through this scenario, a comparison was made between a process that uses traditional site-document management and a process that uses databases, and details on the information stored through the information management database were created.At construction sites, the person in charge of preparing a document generated during the course of construction prepares a document, which is then reviewed by the relevant authorized persons (those in charge of quality management, those in charge of official affairs, deputy manager of the construction project, general manager, site manager, etc.), after which the construction begins. The prepared documents are stored in the form of personal files kept by the document preparer and in the form of documents stored in the document archive of the site; after construction is over, the documented information is turned into electronic documents and then uploaded to a management system such as PMIS.The basic structure of document management using information management database is the same as that of the existing document management method.

"basic structure of document management using information management database is the same as that of the existing document management method. However, document management using an information management database will additionally build a database for information accumulation. This information management database stores the reorganized information that classifies the site-document information according to the ISB and additionally stores the e-documents of the actual site document. This process is advantageous in that it can enter into the database information generated by construction sites without omissions, thanks to the categorization of documented information generated onsite and the electronic storage of such documents. As such, the possibility of loss of information generated onsite is lowered, and searching for needed information is more convenient, thanks to the information database. Figure9depicts a comparison between the current method of management of documents generated at construction sites (As-is) and the method utilizing the information management database (To-be).Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of document management methods.The current method of document management is not based on storage in a consolidated database but rather in individual storage or in onsite document archives. As such, when personnel that had been working on a particular construction site are redeployed to another site after the work is complete, the documents managed by"
"in a consolidated database but rather in individual storage or in onsite document archives. As such, when personnel that had been working on a particular construction site are redeployed to another site after the work is complete, the documents managed by individual preparers of documents are often dispersed, thus obstructing consolidated management of documents, while documents that are stored at the site are often not categorized, which reduces their usefulness and obstructs feedback for follow-up projects.However, the method proposed in the present study not only provides for document management and storage by individual preparers and onsite document archives but also for information storage in a consolidated database, allowing for the consolidated management of the information generated by a construction site, as well as for the categorization of documented information through a categorization system, allowing for the effective use of the information and in turn enabling feedback for follow-up projects. While the process of storing prepared documented information into the database through categorization (the To-be shadowed part of Figure9) requires time because the person in charge at the site must upload the information to a database, the additional storage of information facilitated by this process prevents problems such as information omissions.The process of storing information into the construction information database consists of categorizing the documented"
"to a database, the additional storage of information facilitated by this process prevents problems such as information omissions.The process of storing information into the construction information database consists of categorizing the documented information (the information generated part in Figure10) contained in each site-generated document (the site-generated document part in Figure10) using the categorization systems (SBS, IBS, etc.) and then storing the categorized information into each data table of the construction information database (the construction information database part in Figure10). All documents are also replicated as electronic documents (Part A of Figure10) and are also stored together with the corresponding documented information in the relevant data table of the database (Part B of Figure10) and can be used as evidentiary materials in cases of claims and other problems in the future.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointStorage of site-generated documents in the construction information database.Furthermore, the data stored in the database have codes corresponding to each level of the SBS to enable linkage with the space-categorized database, which allows confirmation as to what stored information is linked to the framework of a given building. Through this method, documented information that is generated at construction sites is stored in the database, and the stored information is processed through the IBS and the SBS and managed as such, which"
"is linked to the framework of a given building. Through this method, documented information that is generated at construction sites is stored in the database, and the stored information is processed through the IBS and the SBS and managed as such, which allows for the reprocessing of stored information into information based on space and information based on type and form. Through this process, information generated through documents not only is stored as documents but can also be recategorized and reprocessed into new information depending on the needs of the user, which is expected to enable more efficient use of the stored information.5.2. Scenario 2 (Derivation of Relevant Documents in Cases of Claims)Once a construction project is finished, claims are often filed against the project due to building defects. To pursue such a claim, one needs to conduct advance assessment, track down and secure evidentiary materials, analyze the evidentiary materials, substantiate the basis of the claim, calculate the expenses, prepare the necessary documents, and then submit the claim. Therefore, in order to successfully raise or defend against a claim, one would need to acquire sufficient evidentiary materials, and \"tracking down evidentiary materials\" is therefore considered very important in each phase of a claim. Furthermore, \"tracking down evidentiary materials\" requires much effort and resources; in this process, the documented information related to the claim that was generated"
