"AbstractWith the rapid development of science and technology pushing people into the information age, the appearance of information technology is a major change for the accounting industry, which will redefine the traditional accounting profession. The new management techniques and concepts also gradually change the traditional accounting working mode by promoting the development of accounting professionals from traditional accounting to accounting information. In recent years, cybercrime and attacking information system vulnerability have occurred frequently. This study utilizes the model and technology in the design of an accounting information management system by simply explaining the idea of cloud technology and examining its logical structure of cloud technology. After that, it designs the cloud platform architecture of the accounting information management system (AIMS) by building the SaaS model. It defines the distributed storage mode of the cloud platform and tests the cluster performance of the system after completing the system design and construction to judge the application effect of the system. Finally, the system operation time, local rows of data, and load balancing are tested experimentally. These results demonstrate that the response relationships of distinct tasks are modified higher than TeraSort, TeraSort higher than Inquiry, and response time is proportional to the amount of Reduce slots when input tasks are the same.

IntroductionCurrently, the convergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning has created computers as a significant tool for human everyday productivity and life. These innovations have played a key role, particularly in the field of data processing, where they can not only store massive amounts of data but also do statistics and analytics on them until further investigation of the practical value of data sources. Since the introduction of application databases, people have handled information much more easily and accurately. As a result, data sources have grown increasingly significant in the domains of business, administration, and investigation. With the maturation of computer technology and the adoption of computers since the beginning of the 21st millennium, many areas of life have created more data than possible while achieving enormous progress. Due to the above, many use the term \"info explosion\" to characterize the exponential increase of data.

"Due to the above, many use the term \"info explosion\" to characterize the exponential increase of data. The abundance of information has also caused numerous challenges in people's everyday activities and lives, particularly those relating to how to access relevant information effectively. Only through understanding market dynamics and user demands and that offering products and services that satisfy market opportunities to customers can contemporary businesses prosper and grow. In a highly competitive market, firms must seek out meaningful information to make maximum utilization of data sources for user monitoring, market research, and analytical decision-making. In the procedure of extracting useable information, irrelevant information has become a headache for businesses, affecting not only the efficiency of information processing but also playing a deceptive role. As a result, data-gathering technology has great value and also builds strong future growth [1].Since financial management is linked to the survival and development of businesses, which is considered very important in enterprise management. In addition, it is also a significant criterion for assessing the operational state of businesses.

"network technology and information technology, more and more businesses are focusing on financial management informationization [2]. The financial management department is the most important aspect of the enterprise's business management. The finance team will synthesize the audit views of all of the enterprise's businesses, and the financial department employees will finish the unified accounting. Therefore, it is urgent to improve enterprise financial information management. This paper uses big data cloud technology to design an accounting information management system [3]. Big data cloud technology uses Internet technology to provide people with various computing resources. Its structure mainly has three levels including platform, resources, and applications. It uses shared resource storage and resource invocation to improve object availability. In an era of fast advances in data processing technologies, organizations are no longer happy with shortcuts like randomized research and sample analysis. They require a significant volume of big-scale data from many domains, as well as an accounting management information system based on a cloud-based accounting framework. The ability to effectively construct an AMIS implementation framework based on cloud accounting has grown dependent on the ability to access huge data.

"implementation framework based on cloud accounting has grown dependent on the ability to access huge data. Enabling the collection of big data inside the big data environment is becoming a very significant problem in contemporary academic and industrial communities.By examining the current studies, it is discovered that the majority of current AIMS construction research concentrates on the conventional Internet environment, whereas AIMS design research integrating big data and cloud accounting is very sparse. Indeed, as big data technology advances, it plays an essential role in corporate management and financial decision-making, and the successful use of big data capabilities is inextricably linked to AIS based on cloud accounting. As a result, this study demonstrates the AIMS framework based on cloud accounting in the era of big data. It elaborates on the responsibility of each component in the framework based on analyzing whether cloud accounting can successfully use accounting information system applications. In addition to the above, this paper uses big data cloud technology to maximize and efficiently integrate computing resources and improve system informatization and intelligence through an in-depth learning network.The main innovations in the research phase of this paper are as follows: (1) Computing, the logical structure of cloud technology, and the RBM energy model based on a learning algorithm.

The scholars in [5] empirically evaluated the practicality of financial information and accounting data in enterprise strategic management and changed the traditional accounting model based on the management information support system. They tried to expand the accounting time range and improved the budgeting process and the ability to analyze the background. The early work of [6] analyzed the role of society, environment, and management in the accounting system, and selected ASG data as the main tool to test sustainable development. In this regard, the work of [7] pointed out that the company's dynamic capability, continuously changing conditions, and environment all affect the effectiveness of the accounting management system, resulting in changes in the accounting management information system.

Overview of Big Bata Cloud for Accounting Management Information System (AIMS)3.1. Cloud ComputingCloud computing is an important product of the rapid development of society and science and technology. Its main feature is that it can realize various cloud platforms such as cloud computing and provide services to users simply and quickly. In terms of technical resources, the analysis can also maximize the utilization of resources. Cloud computing technology can seamlessly connect various data on the network.Enterprises and individuals are the main service groups of cloud computing. The cloud computing platform is implemented by using various technologies and algorithms, so the hardware cost is low. It is possible to perform the upgrade later if the technology is replaced and the code is produced. There is no need to add or replace other hardware.

"is replaced and the code is produced. There is no need to add or replace other hardware. After using the cloud technology, the operation efficiency is also significantly improved, and the enterprise development ability and service level are also rapidly improved. In the later stage, the maintenance and upgrade operations can be completed under the network environment and will not be limited by location, time, etc. At present, the cloud service model involves 3 kinds, namely, public, private, and hybrid. Groups and individuals are the primary users of the private cloud. The general public is the primary user of the public cloud. The hybrid cloud is created by combining the public and private clouds. User groups are categorized based on their user status [12].3.1.1. Logical Structure of Cloud TechnologyNIST divides cloud technology into PaaS platform as a service, SaaS software as a service, and IaaS infrastructure and services. The SaaS is a cloud technology paradigm implemented on cloud service providers' equipment and delivered to consumers via web applications and online interfaces. Users are not required to manage or develop [13]. PaaS may give operating applications and grow users as a secondary development platform. Users can utilize the built-in applications to fulfill services without managing the underlying hardware. The IaaS model provides users with virtualization infrastructure, including network and server, so that users can run the deployed application."
"Users can utilize the built-in applications to fulfill services without managing the underlying hardware. The IaaS model provides users with virtualization infrastructure, including network and server, so that users can run the deployed application. Organizations at home and abroad give a variety of cloud technology structure schemes based on the three levels of cloud technology and develop a cloud technology reference framework by combining ITU-T and SO/IEC JTC 1. Figure1shows the logical architecture of cloud technology.According to the above figure, the processing schemes of cloud technology structure in different countries, mainly including the PaaS platform layer, IaaS resource layer, SaaS application layer, operation support, security, business support, and integration layer provide cross-level services.3.2. The Accounting Information and Account Information Management System3.2.1. The Accounting Information Based on Big DataBig data refers to a tremendous quantity of data sources with different sources, complicated and numerous kinds, higher speed of processing, and whose value may be regenerated many times, with the qualities of enormous volume, variety, fast throughput, and low population density. Big data encompasses a wide range of data kinds. Presently, accounting information is mostly collected via structured data. Simultaneously, unorganized data is critical for financial decisions.

"a wide range of data kinds. Presently, accounting information is mostly collected via structured data. Simultaneously, unorganized data is critical for financial decisions. As a result, in the era of big data, businesses must gather unstructured data, raise the amount of unstructured data gathering and analyze and comprehend this data to enhance decision-making correctness.Furthermore, Accounting Information Management System (AIMS) is a software program designed for analyzing accounting data. The AIMS is a required guarantee for successful enterprise management and judgment, which is an essential forum for corporate market analysis. The financial information system collects, saves, and evaluates financial data to analyze the enterprise's business operations and outcomes to generate financial data. Following the completion of accounting by the financial information system, the management information system starts to evaluate important data, give practical knowledge, and make smart judgments. The financial information generated by the AIMS is communicated to the management information system and analyzed to help enterprise management and judgment. A typical structure of an Accounting Information Management System (AIMS) can be represented in Figure2.(i)Source of data:These are financial transactions that are entered into the system interior as well as from exterior sources. These statistics result from financial considerations with other commercial enterprises and individuals"
"represented in Figure2.(i)Source of data:These are financial transactions that are entered into the system interior as well as from exterior sources. These statistics result from financial considerations with other commercial enterprises and individuals outside the company. Transactions such as sales of products and services, inventory, buying, and collecting payments are examples. Interior financial transactions are the resources inside an organization that comprises transaction considerations. For instance, raw - materials movements, fixed cost depreciation, manufacturing stock, and labor.(ii)Data collection:The initial operational step of AIMS is data collection. Before entering the procedure, data must be cleaned of significant mistakes. This step is the most crucial in many ways since there is a possibility of providing wrong information if significant mistakes are not corrected. Such occurrences might lead to improper actions and judgments by users.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn data collection, there are two principles: suitability and efficacy. Only relevant data is entered into the information system. The primary responsibility of the system operator is to determine whether data are acceptable. He or she gets this by evaluating user needs.

"by evaluating user needs. As a consequence, only relevant data will add to the information. A filter for incorrect data is created during the data collection stage. Data is acquired only once for an effective data collection step. These data can then be used by a variety of users, which may be saved and backed up later. The capability of an information system in terms of data collection, analysis, and storage is restricted. Overburdening a device while backing up data will reduce the system's efficacy.(i)Processing of data:The acquired data must be processed to produce an item. Examples include mathematical algorithms used during production scheduling, analytical tools for sales forecasting, and accounting entry requirements.(ii)Database Management System (DBMS):Organizational databases are physical locations for storing financial data. This storing place might be a filing cabinet or a computer disc. The three main roles of database administration are storing, retrieving, and deleting. In the storing procedure, new entries are entered and transported to an appropriate location on the database. The fetching function is used to extract an existing record from a database. After the data is processed, the saving function loads up the new data, whereas the removing function removes the old and useless data from the database.(iii)Production of information:The process of organizing, structuring, and providing information to users is known as information creation.

This data can be operating documentation, including a sales order, a technical analysis, or a computer output message. A helpful piece of information has 5 elements: applicability, reality, accuracy, consistency, and summary.3.2.2. Cloud Computing in the Era of AIMSConventional accounting system models cannot efficiently analyze and handle financial data in the age of big data. For this purpose, cloud computing services solutions are required. Firstly, cloud computing has extraordinary data analysis and process technology, which allows it to handle large volumes of information in a short time of time while precisely analyzing and revealing the features and underlying relationships among economic data and information. Secondly, cloud services technology can enable inter enterprise collaboration. Thorough analysis and interpretation of corporate financial data may be accomplished without raising operations and management expenses and sharing resources among multiple agencies within the enterprise. Moreover, cloud computing technology can facilitate company resource sharing and thorough evaluation and discussion of business financial information without rising operational and administration expenditures.The virtualization of financial"
"enterprise. Moreover, cloud computing technology can facilitate company resource sharing and thorough evaluation and discussion of business financial information without rising operational and administration expenditures.The virtualization of financial information and cloud services is the primary purpose of cloud computing technology. Financial data virtualization is considered one of the key technologies for implementing accounting information in the cloud. It combines both processing and analytical operations of business financial data to increase the capacity to consolidate and develop an analysis of data. Virtualization of all sorts of data saved in the cloud optimizes financial accounting information and data supplies while improving server resource efficiency. Furthermore, financial information virtualization allows users to swiftly access financial information based on various commands and discover the logical linkages hidden behind huge data.Besides the above, the conventional AIMS is insufficiently robust wherein the processing of data is ineffective, therefore, requiring the manual collaboration of financial personnel to a great extent which considerably decreases the effectiveness of information processing. In such cases, the accounting information Management system can only offer managers past and factual analysis of data. Unfortunately, the failure to gain real-time control over the business management, financial planning process, and financial decision-making"
"cases, the accounting information Management system can only offer managers past and factual analysis of data. Unfortunately, the failure to gain real-time control over the business management, financial planning process, and financial decision-making frequently causes the ideal time to deal with risks to be postponed. The AIMS, which is built on cloud computing services, promotes collaboration and data exchange among multiple company departments while also addressing the issue of financial accounting availability. The cloud computing computerized system model study's ultimate purpose is to cope with the different outputs of AIMSs and give consumers of financial data an accurate and full foundation for decision-making.3.3. Restricted Boltzmann Machine Energy Model Based on Deep Learning AlgorithmA neural network is a typical mathematical tool used in the area of AI and machine learning. Compared with the traditional second-generation neural network, the deep learning algorithm solves the problem of low learning efficiency. It regards a multi-layer model as stacking multiple different RBM or similar unit models and then learning RBM layer by layer to realize the training of multi-layer models. Thus, the RBM model is the main content of deep learning.A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a creative probabilistic artificial neural network good at learning a probability distribution across a collection of inputs.

General Structure of Accounting Information Management SystemThis paper designs an effective and reliable accounting information management system utilizing big data cloud computing. Its essence is a cloud operation of an information management system [14]. The cloud platform design and multi-level architecture deployment are completed by merging the fundamental needs of the accounting information management system with the characteristics of different types of information software on the cloud platform, as illustrated in Figure3[15].Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe above Figure shows the accounting information management system based on big data cloud technology. The system is composed of four layers, namely, the data layer, infrastructure layer, application layer, and management platform layer. The user logs in to the system operating system function at the smartphone client or computer PC [16]. User types mainly include enterprise management,"
"layers, namely, the data layer, infrastructure layer, application layer, and management platform layer. The user logs in to the system operating system function at the smartphone client or computer PC [16]. User types mainly include enterprise management, enterprise workers, and system administrators. The system administrator has the highest authority. The infrastructure layer includes various equipment and components to provide basic support for the operation of the accounting information management system. A huge amount of data resources are stored in the data layer as the resource basis required by the accounting information management system. The management platform layer is the maintenance center of the accounting information management system, and the application layer is the service provider.4.2. SaaS Model of Accounting Information Management SystemIn this paper, the persistence layer is introduced to deal with the efficiency of system data extraction, and the internal ORM mapping function is used to speed up data reading. As shown in Figure4, the SaaS model required for this design is shown. The control layer uses the persistence layer to map data during data reading and then reads data information after passing through the data layer.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe main part of the scheme is the persistence layer ORM, which is further processed and processed, based on the Dao architecture, and the database layer and business logic layer are selected to build an"
"the data layer.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe main part of the scheme is the persistence layer ORM, which is further processed and processed, based on the Dao architecture, and the database layer and business logic layer are selected to build an interaction center. Historical data is sent to the accounting information management system for analysis via the persistence layer, and the processing procedure is optimized. There is no need to transmit or duplicate data for processing to enhance the overall effectiveness of data interaction [17]. The persistence layer's core modules use the mapping concept to extract and retrieve database information. The data reading and writing process are different from the data reading and writing function of SQL statements. It can quickly enhance the data reading speed and simplify the data extraction process, to greatly enhance all processes of the scheme.4.3. Distributed Storage Based on Cloud PlatformBased on the cloud platform of the established accounting information management system, a large amount of financial data and materials of the enterprise are stored in a distributed storage model [18]. Generally, the previous accounting information office system mainly focused on the centralized storage of financial data in the server, which could not achieve the purpose of storing a large amount of data. It could only extract some local data and provide basic business operations and services to local customers, resulting in limitations and"
"storage of financial data in the server, which could not achieve the purpose of storing a large amount of data. It could only extract some local data and provide basic business operations and services to local customers, resulting in limitations and regional restrictions in the application of the system and the satisfaction of company users when using the system. The distributed storage strategy used in this study may circumvent regional limits, find the user region, and preserve financial data from each branch firm based on various regions. As a result, the system's data storage efficiency has been greatly increased, as have the system's application efficiency and security. As shown in Figure5, the distributed storage scheme is based on a cloud platform.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe above figure shows the distributed storage mode based on a cloud platform. The system can save the accounting data of branches and departments of large group companies in different regions of the country in the accounting information system [19]. Figures1,3, and4depict accounting systems from three distinct branches that are communicated to the cloud database via the established accounting information cloud platform. The data on this platform allows the finance departments of various branches to exchange their data resources.

As a result, corporate managers and employees may log in to the system and query the financial data of various branches. While departments of the group firm master its operation condition, properly comprehend the business's overall capital flow, prevent enterprise business limits, and shorten the system operation cycle. At the same time, the accounting information systems of branches set up in different regions will save the corresponding accounting data in the local resource database. Where it utilizes the cloud platform to consistently manage and analyze the financial data of each area to maximize business resources and achieve resource and financial information sharing [20].5. System Testing and SimulationThis study proposes an accounting information management system based on big data cloud technology for managing business finances based on accounting data informatization [21]. In this paper, the system cluster test is carried out experimentally. The test contents include job timeliness, data locality, load balance, and so on. The job forms adopted in the experiment are modified, inquiry and TeraSort. The inquiry job is used to query the reimbursement time or vouchers. There are many disk UO operations required in the operation phase, which can accurately detect the platform task throughput and load status. TeraSort is the main tool for testing the cloud platform.

"reimbursement time or vouchers. There are many disk UO operations required in the operation phase, which can accurately detect the platform task throughput and load status. TeraSort is the main tool for testing the cloud platform. It can input financial information into the accounting information management system without processing the output data. The modified job is used to represent mechanism vouchers or manual vouchers. After changing the job information, the new data is captured in the HBase database, and the prior information is erased. Under the premise of the same input data for the above three different job forms, in the output data volume, modify is higher than TeraSort, and TeraSort is higher than inquiry. Select the corresponding task scheduling based on the fair scheduling algorithm.5.1. Job Response TimeWhen assessing the job response time in this article, it is assumed that each task has 10 decreases and 100 maps. All machines run tasks at the same time. At the same time, there are certain differences in the amount of data during task execution, which can fully reflect the fairness of scheduling. The job response time of the system is listed in Table1.1.Operating system response time on platforms with different data volumes.Whether to use Hadoop data volume320 M640 M1280 M2560 MN-Hadoop modify11224453920Hadoop modify139236441882N-Hadoop TeraSort79163331672Hadoop TeraSort86171330655N-Hadoop inquiry3366132265Hadoop inquiry3161120247According to the data in the"
"data volumes.Whether to use Hadoop data volume320 M640 M1280 M2560 MN-Hadoop modify11224453920Hadoop modify139236441882N-Hadoop TeraSort79163331672Hadoop TeraSort86171330655N-Hadoop inquiry3366132265Hadoop inquiry3161120247According to the data in the preceding table, assuming that the input tasks are entirely consistent, the response relationship of various tasks is that modify surpasses teraport and TeraSort exceeds inquiry. Because the tasks of teraport and reducer are relatively simple, the efficiency of running jobs is faster than that of modifying jobs. The number of reduce and inquiry tasks is small, so the required cycle is short. An in-depth data study reveals that when the amount of data is little, hence the effect of utilizing the Hadoop platform in the system is less than that of not using the Hadoop platform. The effect of this system platform is remarkable after continuously increasing the amount of data. After the amount of input data increased to 2560m, the modification task decreased significantly, from 920 to 876 with an increase of 4.78%. The teraport mission was decreased from 672 s to 654 s, a 2.68% increase, fulfilling the target. The query task has grown by 6.8%, from 247 s to 265 s.The number of reduced task slots in the Hadoop cluster directly affects the balanced load results.

"reduced task slots in the Hadoop cluster directly affects the balanced load results. Here, the input job is set to 1280 M, and there are 8 map task volumes. Different task slot numbers can be obtained, which affect the job response time of the accounting information system. In this paper, the above three different task modes are used, and there are two scheduling modes. The data obtained are shown in Table2, in which OBDN belongs to the improved scheduling algorithm.2.Job response time of different degree algorithms.Scheduling algorithm24816Number of reduced slotsModify OBDN762593450393Modify fair801612414381TeraSort OBDN630448327267TeraSort fair654469292251Inquiry fair41927512778Inquiry OBDN44028814191To enable tasks to select jobs evenly and randomly, the jobs belong to teraport, so there is a large amount of output data. The advantage of this method is that it can better detect the actual running status of all nodes. The 1280 M job input data, 8 map tasks, and 8 reduced tasks set here are shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAccording to the response time results of the reduced task shown in Figure5above, adding load balancing can keep the processing cycles of all reduced slot tasks in a stable state. During the scheduling decision-making period of fair and OBDN, there are differences in the standard deviation and mean value of the operation cycle. The mean value of fair is 218, and the standard deviation is 30.79. The standard deviation and mean value of fair"
"scheduling decision-making period of fair and OBDN, there are differences in the standard deviation and mean value of the operation cycle. The mean value of fair is 218, and the standard deviation is 30.79. The standard deviation and mean value of fair scheduling decisions are 13.02 and 214 respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the average operation time of the reduced task slot cannot be increased during teraport operation, while the processing cycles of all tasks are relatively balanced. The operation cycle of reduction is balanced, and its movement speed is relatively uniform, which can maximize the use of reduction.5.2. Analysis of System Task Locality and Acceleration Rate5.2.1. Task Locality AnalysisIn this paper, when detecting the local characteristics of cluster data, the size of the local data row directly affects the speed of the accounting information management system. In this paper, teraport, modify and inquiry run together, and each job is set to have 320m of input data and 8 reduced tasks. Three different types of jobs should be submitted at the same time by a shell script. After completion, continue to run three times and then count the number of all local tasks. Equation (7) is used for calculating the local rate of tasks.(7)After the fair scheduling policy has been run three times, the number of local tasks is 20, 28, 40, and 49, and the number of local tasks of the OBDN scheduling policy is 19, 31, 46, and 52. The data obtained is shown in"
"the local rate of tasks.(7)After the fair scheduling policy has been run three times, the number of local tasks is 20, 28, 40, and 49, and the number of local tasks of the OBDN scheduling policy is 19, 31, 46, and 52. The data obtained is shown in Figure7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAccording to the above Figure, after the number of map tasks was adjusted from 4 to 10, there was no significant change in the OBDN scheduling strategy as a whole. The local rate is lower than the OBDN when the fair scheduling policy has four task slots. After the number of reduced tasks, slots continue to increase then the local rate increases slightly. However, when the number of reduced task slots increases to 10 then the local rate decreases.5.2.2.

"TeraSort workloads are sensitive to CPU usage in different ways, and Hadoop accelerates more quickly.Figure9explains the comparison of the Job response time of various degree algorithms. By analyzing this figure, it can be seen that the OBDN scheduling method is better than fair after reducing the number of reduced slots on the premise that the job scheduling strategy is completely consistent. After continuously increasing the number of slots, the feature of the fair can be better reflected. When reduce is the number of 8 task slots, the modified task time will be reduced to a certain extent, from 450 s to 414 s, and teraport from 327 s to 292 s.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint6.

"AbstractAims/IntroductionOur objective was to estimate the prevalence of hyperglycemia at baseline, and identify its predictors among community clinic (CC) users from a selected rural area of Bangladesh.Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study partly used the baseline data of implementation research in which a total of 11,244 adults visited the CC, and their blood glucose, blood pressure and anthropometry were evaluated according to 'Action 2' of the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) protocol 1. Of these, 11,144 had complete information on demography, chronic diseases and their risk factors, which were collected during the implementation of 'Action 1' of WHO PEN protocol 1 at the household level. Hyperglycemia, prediabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes were diagnosed using the WHO criteria.ResultsUsing WHO PEN protocol 1, the estimated baseline prevalence was 12.5% for hyperglycemia, 3.4% for PreD and 9.2% for type 2 diabetes, and was more prevalent among men compared with women. PreD and type 2 diabetes had significantly higher odds ratio (OR >1) of having common risk factors as follows: age ≥40 years (PreD,P< 0.001; type 2 diabetes,P< 0.001), generalized obesity (PreD,P< 0.001; type 2 diabetes,P= 0.005) and hypertension (PreD,P< 0.000; type 2 diabetes,P< 0.001).

"(PreD,P< 0.001; type 2 diabetes,P= 0.005) and hypertension (PreD,P< 0.000; type 2 diabetes,P< 0.001). Furthermore, participants with a family history of diabetes appeared to be a significant predictor of type 2 diabetes (P< 0.001), but not for PreD (P= 0.303).ConclusionsHyperglycemia, preD and type 2 diabetes showed a comparatively high prevalence among the CC users of the selected rural area. Obesity and hypertension are the key modifiable risk factors that should be reduced using a CC-centered risk reduction strategy.INTRODUCTIONDiabetes is a metabolic disorder or syndrome characterized by chronic hyperglycemia (presence of high blood glucose) that occurs due to a defect in insulin action or its secretions, or a combination of both1. Among chronic diseases, hyperglycemia is a major public health concern that has multisystemic effects resulting in mortality from infections, blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, chronic liver disease, stroke and lower limb amputation2. Although it can be mostly prevented through healthy lifestyles, it is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide3. Again, its negative total effect on reducing global health-adjusted life expectancy is also greater4. Like other developed countries, people of Southeast Asia are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes irrespective of region, diet and socioeconomic status5.

"of Southeast Asia are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes irrespective of region, diet and socioeconomic status5. Among the various ethnic populations, type 2 diabetes is sixfold more common in people of South Asian descent, threefold more common in those of African and African-Caribbean descent, and more common in people of Chinese descent compared with the white population6. A recent study reported that the global prevalence of diabetes was 9.3% in 20197, and by 2045, the number might increase to 700 million (10.9%)8. This increasing pattern also influences developing countries to provide efficient diabetes care to their population, which are marginalized due to inadequate infrastructure within existing health systems9. Thus, the rate of diabetes-associated complications is rising, and threatens to reverse the economic gains of those countries9.Bangladesh is a developing country, and is facing the third phase of an epidemiological transition characterized by continuous growth in the prevalence of diabetes and other chronic noncommunicable diseases, especially in rural areas10. In Bangladesh, most of the population (~73%) is living in rural areas where the epidemiological transition has already changed population perception, healthcare infrastructure and healthcare provider characteristics10. Therefore, the current rural settings are very different from urban settings in terms of lifestyle, disease pattern and health-seeking behavior. Despite available health facilities,"
"healthcare infrastructure and healthcare provider characteristics10. Therefore, the current rural settings are very different from urban settings in terms of lifestyle, disease pattern and health-seeking behavior. Despite available health facilities, rural patients depend on homeopathic physicians, local nurses, hospital compounders, and the sellers of medical stores and so on during their medical emergencies11. Their strong beliefs in superstitions encouraged them to go to local herbalists, Hakim or Kabiraj for a natural cure, who have limited knowledge of modern medical sciences11. In these circumstances, nearly half of the population with diabetes is undiagnosed. Furthermore, among those diagnosed with diabetes, only one in three patients is treated, and approximately one in 13 achieve treatment targets12. Thus, identification of hyperglycemia or diabetes among the rural population of Bangladesh is inadequate, and appropriate care and follow up are unlikely, which requires a unique, easily applicable, accessible and cost-effective screening program in resource-constrained settings.Prediabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes are evaluated in Bangladesh in various settings. Based on the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in the year 2020, the prevalence of preD and type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh is 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively13. However, only two national surveys reported that the prevalence of hyperglycemia in rural areas was 2.8% and 7.1%14,15. Based on"
"published in the year 2020, the prevalence of preD and type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh is 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively13. However, only two national surveys reported that the prevalence of hyperglycemia in rural areas was 2.8% and 7.1%14,15. Based on available rural studies, the prevalence of preD ranges from 13.3% to 23.5%16,17, and type 2 diabetes ranges from 2.2% to 30.8%13,16-19. Studies reporting hyperglycemia in terms of preD and type 2 diabetes in rural settings are scanty. Furthermore, there is heterogenicity among the available studies that followed various methods and cut-off points to diagnose hyperglycemia. Again, we have not found a study that evaluated hyperglycemia following the World Health Organization Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN)20, which is a globally acceptable cost-effective protocol to address noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors for prevention and management. In 2009, the Bangladesh Government launched a community-based project, namely 'Revitalization of Community Health Care Initiatives in Bangladesh', to provide doorstep primary healthcare services to the marginalized rural population of Bangladesh. Following this initiative, the country is trying to establish a referral chain for chronic diseases, and the community clinics (CC) are the base from which the screened positive population is referred to the higher center to maintain continuity of care.

"to establish a referral chain for chronic diseases, and the community clinics (CC) are the base from which the screened positive population is referred to the higher center to maintain continuity of care. Aligned with the Revitalization of Community Health Care Initiatives in Bangladesh', in Bangladesh, we first attempted to apply the WHO PEN protocol 1 in primary care settings to report the baseline prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (HTN). First, only the protocols for cardiovascular disease and diabetes were selected for implementation in a rural setting. To address the evidence gap, this study primarily aimed at determining the baseline prevalence of hyperglycemia (preD and type 2 diabetes) among CC users in a rural area of Bangladesh. Additionally, we also evaluated the predictors of hyperglycemia (preD and type 2 diabetes) among the study population as an adjunct.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy design, settings and populationThe present cross-sectional study was part of implementation research that intended to implement a program of NCDs in a selected rural area of Bangladesh.

The current study utilized the baseline data of those who visited the nearby CC during the implementation of WHO PEN protocol 1 in the Dhangara Union of Raiganj Upazila under the Sirajganj district, a rural area of the Rajshahi division of Bangladesh. A total of 26 CC of Dhangara Union were included in the WHO PEN implementation. Initially, an open invitation was sent to participate in the research to the adult (aged ≥18 years) residents of that area. To encourage residents, mass media campaigns, announcements, distribution of brochures and sending multipurpose volunteers to households were carried out. The WHO PEN implementation program excluded those who were mentally challenged or pregnant, or institutionalized in a hospital, prison, nursing home or other such institutions (Figure1, FigureS1).

"and adapted as per the 'Action 1 (ask about)' and 'Action 2 (Assess)' sections of the WHO PEN protocol 120. For the inclusion and exploration of more risk factors, a few of the core and expanded questions of the STEP-wise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) of the NCD risk factors survey questionnaire of the WHO (version 3.2) were added21. We modified both the WHO STEPS and 'Action 1' of the WHO PEN questionnaires to draft the final questionnaire. The final drafted questionnaire has broadly two sections: section 1 is \"asking questions\" and section 2 is \"measurements.\" We followed STEP one (demographic information and behavioral measurement) of the STEPS survey questionnaire and the 'Action 1' of WHO PEN to prepare the \"asking questions\" section of the drafted questionnaire. Again, we used STEP two (physical measurements) and STEP three (biochemical measurements) of the STEPS survey questionnaire, and the 'Action 2' of WHO PEN to draft the \"measurements\" section of the questionnaire. The draft questionnaire was pre-tested first to detect any inconsistency, unclear wording or unusually longer time to administer, and finalized after appropriate modification.Data collection in households and CCA face-to-face interview collected data using a mobile app developed based on a semistructured pretested questionnaire.

"data using a mobile app developed based on a semistructured pretested questionnaire. A group of well-trained male and female data collectors interviewed the participants, measured their physical parameters, and assessed glycemic status both at households (HH) and CC, respectively. The monitoring team remained anonymous to the data collectors to reduce bias. Again, to reduce the recall bias, enough time was given to the respondents, and show cards were used to understand the risk factors.At the HH level, 'section 1' was used to collect data on sociodemographic status, existing comorbidities, family history of chronic diseases, behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet habits, added salt intake) and metabolic risk factors (history of pre-existing elevated blood glucose and elevated blood pressure). It took approximately 25-30 min to interview each participant, and then it was suggested they visit the nearby CC the next day in the fasting state to assess the physical and biochemical parameters. In the CC, we used 'section 2' of the drafted questionnaire to record anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP) and capillary blood glucose levels. A standard weight scale (model BR2016; CAMRY, Kowloon, Hong Kong), height measurement scales, measuring tape and automated digital BP machine (model JPN two; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) were used to record weight, height, waist circumference and BP, respectively, of the respondents.

"Kong), height measurement scales, measuring tape and automated digital BP machine (model JPN two; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) were used to record weight, height, waist circumference and BP, respectively, of the respondents. Physical measurements were carried out according to the 'NCD risk factors survey Bangladesh 2010'22. Fasting capillary glucose was measured with a standard glucometer (GlucoLeaderTM Enhance; HMD BioMedical, Taiwan) with aseptic precautions. BP was measured twice and the mean of the two measurements was used to determine the final BP. All physical measurements were carried out maintaining adequate privacy. The details of the study methods are elaborately described elsewhere23,24.Definition of hyperglycemia and its risk factorsHyperglycemia (prediabetes and diabetes) is defined as fasting plasma glucose of ≥6.1 mmoL/L25. Here, PreD was defined as fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9 mmoL/L25. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed using WHO criteria as follows: fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmoL/L and/or self-statement of a person as a known diabetes patient or taking antidiabetic medication25. Here, new cases were those diagnosed for the first time in the study, and old cases were those previously diagnosed by a health professional and/or documented intake of antidiabetic drugs for hyperglycemia.We followed the 'NCD risk factors survey Bangladesh 2010' to define several risk factors, including current tobacco use, current alcohol consumption, inadequate fruit and/or vegetable"

Again, generalized obesity and central obesity were defined according to the WHO and the International Diabetes Federation classification26,27. The details of the definitions are added in TableS1.Statistical analysisThe current study presented the baseline data that were collected from 26 CC of the selected rural area during the WHO PEN protocol implementation. Based on the initial checking, the current study analyzed a total of 11,145 participants out of 11,244 who visited the CC, completed physical and biochemical measurements, and had complete information on sociodemographics, comorbidities, family history of chronic diseases, behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Data were analyzed using the statistical software Statistical Product and Service Solutions version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All the estimates of precision were presented at a 95% confidence interval (CI), as appropriate.

"significant (two-sided) at a level ofP< 0.05.We used descriptive statistics to present the first objective of this study (distribution of hyperglycemia) according to age, sex and risk factors. Therefore, categorical variables were presented using frequency and percentages, and the continuous variable was presented using mean and standard deviation. We also used error bars to represent the overall, new and old cases of hyperglycemia.We applied multinomial logistic regression analysis to identify the predictors of preD and type 2 diabetes, which was our second objective. As none of the regression assumptions were violated, the eligible variables to be included in the multinomial logistic regression were identified using the univariate analyses, where aP≤ 0.25 was considered as the cut-off. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and the factors that had OR >1 was presented in the regression table for each outcome variable. We adjusted the following factors: age, sex, family history of diabetes, fruit and/or vegetable intake, fast food intake, physical activity, generalized obesity, and HTN.RESULTSPrevalence of hyperglycemia among the study populationOverall, the prevalence of hyperglycemia was 12.5% among the selected rural area of Bangladesh (Figure2).

"studies that reported hyperglycemia (2.8%, 7.1%) in a rural setting14,15. Among hyperglycemic participants, 3.4% and 9.2% had prediabetes and diabetes, respectively. The baseline prevalence of hyperglycemia or diabetes varied in the countries that implemented the WHO PEN interventions. Among them, a higher baseline prevalence was reported by Gaza (62.9%)28, Myanmar (17.1%)29, Bhutan (20.6%)30, Moldova (14.7%)31and Chandigarh in India (14.1%)32. Again, a prevalence similar to the current study was reported by Korea (12.4%)33. The prevalence of preD in the current study was much lower than in previous studies in Bangladesh16,17. However, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher than preD and lower than the latest estimate by the International Diabetes Federation (14.2%)9. Interestingly, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the current study was exactly like the study that used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-1816. A previous study also reported that preD has decreased in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2017/1818. One of the most important explanations for this decline of preD and increase of type 2 diabetes include high conversion of the population with preD to type 2 diabetes. In this regard, Edelsteinet al.34evaluated and discussed several factors behind the high conversion of preD to type 2 diabetes in their article that included: ethnicity, family history, criteria adopted to define outcomes, obesity, and male gender.

"Edelsteinet al.34evaluated and discussed several factors behind the high conversion of preD to type 2 diabetes in their article that included: ethnicity, family history, criteria adopted to define outcomes, obesity, and male gender. Although it is beyond our scope to explain all these factors for our study population, we can assume the South Asian ethnicity, nearly one-fourth (21.4%) with a positive family history of hyperglycemia and higher burden of preD in men could favor the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and low prevalence of preD in our rural population. This phenomenon of conversion from preD to type 2 diabetes is important for clinical and public health. This is because preD is a latent period of type 2 diabetes when various microvascular complications may develop in a healthy individual, and intervention in this stage may prevent the development of overt type 2 diabetes in later life.We found an age-specific increasing pattern of type 2 diabetes among the study population. It is well established evidence supported by previous studies in Bangladesh13,14,19,35. This age-related increase in blood glucose has been believed multifactorial, especially in the elderly population, and possible factors are islet cell dysfunction, inefficient insulin in circulation, decreased insulin level, reduced insulin sensitivity, increased stress hormones, impaired intracellular whole-body glucose oxidation, and increase glucose intolerance36. In addition to these biochemical and"
"dysfunction, inefficient insulin in circulation, decreased insulin level, reduced insulin sensitivity, increased stress hormones, impaired intracellular whole-body glucose oxidation, and increase glucose intolerance36. In addition to these biochemical and cellular factors, some physical and behavioral factors also contribute to age-related increases in blood glucose, such as physical inactivity, sarcopenia, and central obesity37.We found that 84.3% of hyperglycemic participants had unhealthy dietary habits and there was a gender difference in dietary preference. Globally, very few studies were conducted to explore gender-based dietary preferences about preD and type 2 diabetes. The review of the literature suggests most of the global studies are aimed at diabetes rather than preD. Moreover, most of the available studies considered gender-based evidence synthesis, have been carried out in the United States and Europe, and the collected data cannot be extended to developing countries like Bangladesh which are geographically and culturally very different from the Western ones38. Among the available Asian studies, a Chinese study reported higher healthy diet consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of preD39. Another Chinese national survey reported an inverse association between fruit and/or vegetable intake and preD or type 2 diabetes that justified inadequate fruit and/or vegetable intake among rural women with preD and type 2 diabetes in the current"
"Another Chinese national survey reported an inverse association between fruit and/or vegetable intake and preD or type 2 diabetes that justified inadequate fruit and/or vegetable intake among rural women with preD and type 2 diabetes in the current study40. A systematic review found smoking in men and HTN and poor diet quality in women are strongly associated with preD, like our finding41. Again, a case-control study in Lithuania reported a significant relationship between the additional addition of salt to prepared meals and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes42. For the current study, the intake of added salt among women with preD or type 2 diabetes is prevalent because they are culturally the main cook in Bangladesh and thus have more access to add salt during cooking or mealtime.We found age (≥40 years) (preD: OR 1.717,P< 0.001; type 2 diabetes: OR 3.238,P< 0.001) and family history of diabetes (preD: OR 1.147,P= 0.303; type 2 diabetes: OR 2.783,P< 0.001) as the two common nonmodifiable predictors of hyperglycemia supported by other studies in rural settings43,44. The impact of age on hyperglycemia has already been described in this article and several possible mechanisms mentioned according to evidence37. Previous multicentric Asian studies reported a significantly increased risk of preD among subjects with a family history of diabetes45.

"multicentric Asian studies reported a significantly increased risk of preD among subjects with a family history of diabetes45. Similarly, the EPIC-InterAct study also confirmed that family history is a strong and independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes46.The current study found generalized obesity and HTN as a predictor of hyperglycemia, which is supported by previous national and international studies19,24. In our study, the prevalence of generalized obesity was very low (3.5%) and logically does not coincide with the high prevalence of hyperglycemia. This phenomenon is termed \"metabolically obese\", which may explain the increased predisposition to diabetes despite the relatively low prevalence of obesity in our study population9. The same pattern was also found in Asian countries compared with the US and Europeans9. Regarding HTN as a predictor of type 2 diabetes, its association is still considered a paradox. This is because the development of HTN and diabetes follow each other over time, and insulin resistance is considered a common feature of both preD and prehypertension and an antecedent of progression to two respective states of the disease47.Strengths and limitationsThis study has several strengths. First (evidence synthesis), it generated the findings of hyperglycemia and its predictors in a rural setting using a universally accepted protocol of WHO PEN that had not previously been applied in any population of Bangladesh.

"synthesis), it generated the findings of hyperglycemia and its predictors in a rural setting using a universally accepted protocol of WHO PEN that had not previously been applied in any population of Bangladesh. Second (use of existing primary care setting), for the first time we used all the CC of a selected rural area to measure glycemic status and anthropometric variables. These CCs are the base of the health care system from which the screened positive population will be referred to the higher canter to maintain continuity of care for preD and type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh. Third (inclusion of a wide range of risk factors), most of the available recent large-scale studies of Bangladesh used the data of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey to report preD, type 2 diabetes, and their risk factors. However, the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data usually focused on demographic variables that are nonmodifiable or difficult to change, and excluded many risk factors that are required to design an intervention. From this perspective, the current study is different and included all established risk factors of hyperglycemia, especially detailed dietary habits.The possible limitations of the present study include lack of temporality due to cross-sectional design; recall bias due to self-reporting of the behavioral risk factors; overestimation or underestimation of the prevalence, as data skewed toward a specific sex; and, finally, the findings of hyperglycemia are"
"lack of temporality due to cross-sectional design; recall bias due to self-reporting of the behavioral risk factors; overestimation or underestimation of the prevalence, as data skewed toward a specific sex; and, finally, the findings of hyperglycemia are difficult to compare with the non-intervention area, where many patients bypass the CC and visit the upper tier of the health system. As the study area was non-randomly selected, generalizability could not be claimed.In conclusion, the prevalence of hyperglycemia and its risk factors among the CC user of a selected rural population of Bangladesh is comparatively high in the current context. Unhealthy diets showed a higher prevalence among participants with hyperglycemia. In contrast, obesity and HTN showed significantly higher predictability for preD and type 2 diabetes. In a CC setting where the resources are poor, such findings are alarming. Thus, the successful implementation of WHO PEN in a CC setting is the key to early detection and management of hyperglycemia. The current study showed that men are less likely to screen for hyperglycemia, although they have a higher burden. Additionally, the present study elucidated an ongoing dietary transition from conventional rural food to Westernized food that can increase the cardiometabolic risk of the rural population. Therefore, to reduce the burden of diabetes and its associated health consequences, more engagement of men should be ensured in screening programs, and"
"rural food to Westernized food that can increase the cardiometabolic risk of the rural population. Therefore, to reduce the burden of diabetes and its associated health consequences, more engagement of men should be ensured in screening programs, and community-level awareness about healthy diet and other related lifestyles should be emphasized by the strategy makers. Again, obesity with low prevalence as a predictor of hyperglycemia is providing a future direction to carry out large-scale prospective studies among the Bangladeshi population to confirm the theory of the 'metabolically obese' phenotype. Taking into account all of these findings, policy makers should give the same preference to healthy eating practices, obesity and HTN in their risk reduction strategy to prevent a future surge of hyperglycemia among the rural population.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank the Noncommunicable Diseases Control Program, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh for their cordial support to implement the study.FUNDING STATEMENTThis study was supported by a grant (Invitation Ref No: DGHS/LD/NCDC/Procurement plan/(GOB) Service/2018-2019/2018/5214/SP-01) from the Noncommunicable Diseases Control Program, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.DISCLOSUREThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Approval of the"

"of hospital management have also been continuously improved. Therefore, if only relying on the personal work experience of managers or the traditional manual management methods, it is far from meeting the needs of the modern medical industry. The long-term direction of the hospital in the information construction project management is to first clarify the scope of the project in the information construction. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure including cost control, improving use efficiency, and ensuring quality and quantity, and finally complete the project task objectives. In the process of project implementation, there must be necessary clear and reasonable risk assessment and risk control measures. Moreover, the construction of hospital informatization can greatly promote the management level and work efficiency of the hospital, and enhance the core competitiveness of the modern hospital. The construction of the hospital's information system is the most effective way for hospitals at all levels in China to strengthen fine management and information management, and take the road of high-precision development. At the same time, the information construction based on the computer network has promoted the scientific and standardized hospital management, which has become an important symbol to measure whether a hospital has a good social image and advanced management level.

"hospital management, which has become an important symbol to measure whether a hospital has a good social image and advanced management level. As we all know, advanced equipment is the strong and effective support needed by the medical and health service industry. Therefore, modern hospital informatization construction management also requires equipment with relatively high performance and relatively low consumption cost, which is the premise to ensure its realization. At present, the high-end medical information management technology used in the medical service industry is based on the use of a large number of instruments and equipment with computer network functions and physical health detection of patients with digital medical diagnosis and treatment.Information-based medical diagnosis and treatment equipment are based on microelectronics technology, software application technology, and high-precision microprocessor technology. This is also in this era of information construction using computer networks. A remarkable achievement under the trend of development has been reached. The equipment in the medical service industry under computer intelligence is widely used, focusing on the fields of clinical data collection and processing, the fields that require online monitoring and warning of abnormal patient information, and the health sector that requires large-scale data analysis.

"processing, the fields that require online monitoring and warning of abnormal patient information, and the health sector that requires large-scale data analysis. From the hardware perspective, the large-scale microelectronic circuit integration technology is the core of the hardware. From the software perspective, the algorithm of ultra-high-speed digital signals and the very mature arithmetic processing program are the basis of the software, and these are intelligent common features of equipment. At the same time, these devices can be based on advanced wireless network communication technology and Internet technology to complete the interconnection with medical diagnosis and treatment equipment in other medical service industries, and realize the sharing of medical resources in a large area with high reliability and low cost. And the rapid development of Internet of Things technology has played a leading role in this regard. The development of my country's medical and health services and the improvement of people's living standards are inseparable from the development and progress of medical information construction.

"new data models and processing algorithms, such as data warehouse and intelligent data analysis, multi-dimensional online data analysis technology and mining, and other technologies, all of which have important applications in the medical and health field.The clinical medical services in the ward can be standardized through the clinical information system. We take the diagnosis and treatment information obtained by the clinical medical staff of the hospital for the diagnosis of the patient and scientifically make it specific and sequenced through a certain method, so as to obtain the best diagnosis and treatment plan, which is called the clinical path. Based on the implementation and application of the clinical information management system, the clinical path will become more standardized, which will be of great help in improving the level of medical management and the quality and efficiency of medical work. The clinical information management system enables each ward to refine and decompose the content of patients' visits by monitoring them, optimizes the quality problems of the smallest unit, and establishes a medical model that can be controlled in real time. The knowledge and management methods of the medical system can be enhanced through the clinical information management system of the ward.

It can transform the medical expert knowledge at the operational level into clear explicit knowledge, transform easily lost knowledge and nonsystematic knowledge into systematic knowledge assets, and at the same time help. The accumulation and integration of clinical wards into medical knowledge resources will help improve the hospital's own medical level.This paper combines the intelligent data management technology to build a general surgery clinical information management system to improve the operation efficiency of general surgery and improve the patient experience.2. Related WorkThe hospital information system is a system that uses computers and communication equipment to collect, process, store, manage, retrieve, and transmit various data, materials, and other information in the hospital [1]. At present, the functional modules of the hospital information system mainly include the inpatient management module, the pharmacy management module, the outpatient diagnosis and treatment management module, the drug storehouse management module, the dean query module, the electronic prescription module, the material management module, the media management module, etc. The hospital information management system aims at providing stronger guarantees [2].

"query module, the electronic prescription module, the material management module, the media management module, etc. The hospital information management system aims at providing stronger guarantees [2]. The main functions that the system can realize are doctor's visit, query function, hospitalization information, data setting and system management, and other basic functions. Among them, in the aspect of clinical information construction, the resident doctor's work module and the nurse's work module in the hospital information system are particularly important. The resident doctor's work module mainly realizes the functions of the clinician in the hospital to write the patient's condition, take daily routine medical orders, and inquire about the various examinations of the inpatient; the work module of the ward nurse provides the management of medical orders in each inpatient ward bed management, hospitalization status of patients, and printing various types of doctor's orders, checklists, and other items [3]. A system that uses electronic equipment based on integrated circuit technology to save, manage, transmit, and reproduce patient medical records is called electronic medical records. The clinical information management system of the ward is based on the two major medical information systems of the hospital information system and the electronic medical record [4].

"of the ward is based on the two major medical information systems of the hospital information system and the electronic medical record [4]. It obtains the effective information of the patients, integrates it, and displays it on the electronic screen interface, replacing the traditional manual transcription mode of the nurses in the ward [5].The hospital information management system, abbreviated HIS, is a system that includes all aspects of the hospital's work and provides a full range of information security for the entire medical process. Management information system, clinical medical information system, and regional medical information network are three stages of hospital information system [6]. The hospital information system proposes three major systems: the hospital information system data model, the hospital information system data management model, and the hospital information system data application model from the aspects of technology, management, and business application, which are closely related to each other. HIS design includes subsystem functional structure design, database design, and program development [7]. The HIS system is mainly constructed and designed based on the hospital information data application system, the hospital information data host system, the hospital information data network system, and the hospital information data physical environment. Relying on the integration of data and business, it finds a new way for cooperation. Usually, the"
"system, the hospital information data host system, the hospital information data network system, and the hospital information data physical environment. Relying on the integration of data and business, it finds a new way for cooperation. Usually, the hospital information system consists of hospital management system, outpatient management system, medical technology management system, inpatient management system, etc. These subsystems together build the hospital information system. Each subsystem has a corresponding functional module framework. The core part of the hospital information system is the database, which is the basic core of the HIS system. The more commonly used databases are Oracle and SQL Server [8].A large amount of important medical-related information in the hospital is stored in the electronic medical record system in electronic form [9]. Its content includes all the information of a paper medical record. In the basic technical architecture of the system, WebService is used, which is mainly implemented on the NET platform. The electronic medical record is based on the intelligent input module of XML technology and makes full use of the advantages of XML technology to realize the input mode of effective combination of free text input and form input [10]. It can easily store XML documents into Oracle database and can effectively convert relational databases and XML documents. Based on such conditions, XML can easily realize the query function, has the ability"
"of free text input and form input [10]. It can easily store XML documents into Oracle database and can effectively convert relational databases and XML documents. Based on such conditions, XML can easily realize the query function, has the ability to perform poststructural analysis of text information, can quickly convert text information into data elements, making it convenient for computer statistics, and can be shared and meet the requirements of the Ministry of Health [11]. The electronic medical record system has specialized data integration middleware and open software architecture, which can make the originally complicated and massive data integration work simple and smooth [12]. At the same time, for the docking of hospital information system, inspection system, and medical imaging system, it can be completed by editing the corresponding configuration file. This docking method no longer requires any extra code-level modification. Read-only data integration is usually completed within 2-3 days [13]. The network communication framework of the medical service industry based on TCP/IP technology is the basis for ensuring the electronic medical record system. The core of this framework is to guarantee a complete medical information service. Through this core service, the system connection and integration between hospitals are possible. The ultimate purpose of this method is to change the traditional way of clinical medical work and process coordination, and to provide an"
"information service. Through this core service, the system connection and integration between hospitals are possible. The ultimate purpose of this method is to change the traditional way of clinical medical work and process coordination, and to provide an active, real-time, and collaborative information exchange platform [14].3. General Surgery Clinical Information Management System Based on Intelligent Data ManagementThe basic building blocks of an information model include entities, entity attributes, and relationships between entities. Among them, the entities are a collection of abstract things or reality with the same characteristics, which is divided into independent entities and subordinate entities. Attributes are the characteristics or properties of entities, and inter-entity relations refer to the logical relationships that exist between entities. This design is to establish an information model according to the business flowchart, in order to sort out the types of information that need to be coded, and to provide the basis for the business logic relationship for the design of the operating mode of the system. The key to the entire information system is how to realize the transmission and storage of the entire information, as well as the processing of changes. The entity set of the information model is established according to the clinical pathway admission assessment flowchart, as shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointPath admission evaluation"
"as well as the processing of changes. The entity set of the information model is established according to the clinical pathway admission assessment flowchart, as shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointPath admission evaluation information model.Figure1shows an information model diagram of path admission evaluation. Among them, entities are divided into independent entities and subordinate entities, entities have certain attributes, and there is an attribute that uniquely identifies each instance, that is, a number. The primary key of the dependent entity inherits the independent entity as one of its own attributes, which is used to indicate which independent entity is the child entity. In the information model of path admission assessment, independent entities include patients, visiting departments, registration offices, auxiliary departments, and clinical paths to which they belong. In addition, other entities exist because of the existence of independent entities, such as the registration form attached to the patient and the registration office department number. In this information model, the logical relationship between the registration office and the registration form is that the registration office writes the registration form, and there is a one-to-many correspondence, which reflects the connection between the two entities. Second, there is a one-to-one correspondence between patients and registration slips, and all of this information can be"
"writes the registration form, and there is a one-to-many correspondence, which reflects the connection between the two entities. Second, there is a one-to-one correspondence between patients and registration slips, and all of this information can be reflected in the information model. It is precisely because of the existence of such a logical relationship between these entities that the information carrier can successfully transmit the target to the entity that needs the target. The design of this model reflects the goals and attributes in the path admission process, and provides a basis for the design of the database [15].An important part of the regional pathological information management system is the remote pathological consultation system. One of the main goals of its design is to solve the problem of unbalanced pathological resources in the region. Due to the limitations of pathological levels in different regions, some hospitals do not have the technology to solve difficult cases, so it is necessary to initiate consultation requests to higher-level hospitals. After receiving consultation in a higher-level hospital, patients or hospitals are often required to send specimens or slides to the higher-level hospital, which greatly increases the cost of medical treatment in some remote areas. On the other hand, there are many patients in large hospitals, the workload of doctors is heavy, and pathological examinations often need to wait for a long time, which is likely to"
"greatly increases the cost of medical treatment in some remote areas. On the other hand, there are many patients in large hospitals, the workload of doctors is heavy, and pathological examinations often need to wait for a long time, which is likely to miss the best time for diagnosis. The remote pathological consultation system realizes the remote transmission of pathological information through modern medical information technology and realizes long-distance pathological consultation. It not only overcomes geographical barriers and greatly reduces the time for pathological examination and diagnosis, but also makes communication between the same industry more closely through Internet technology. This promotes the medical re-education of pathology, thereby improving the uneven distribution of pathological resources and realizing the sharing of pathological resources. Pathological consultation mainly uses the digital slide scanning system to stitch the slide scans under the digital microscope into full-field pathological slide images (digital slides). After a lower-level doctor initiates a consultation, the patient information and digital slice information can be uploaded to the system, and the higher-level doctor will send back the results after consultation based on the received patient information and digital slice information. The remote pathological consultation system based on the B/S development model can complete a diagnosis by logging into the system in the network"
"back the results after consultation based on the received patient information and digital slice information. The remote pathological consultation system based on the B/S development model can complete a diagnosis by logging into the system in the network environment through a tablet computer, mobile phone, or computer. Figure2shows a flowchart of a consultation initiated by a subordinate pathologist based on the regional pathological information management system [16].Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointFlowchart of consultation in regional pathological information management system.The metadata server NameNode of HDFS is responsible for managing the system namespace and user access to files. When a user writes a file, it waits until the file data size reaches one block before contacting the metadata server. Then, the metadata server stores the file obituary information in its namespace, assigns a block to the file, and returns the ID of the DataNode where the block is located to the client. The NameNode node server stores the two most important tables in the entire system: the mapping between the file name and the block sequence and the mapping between the data block and the machine list. The filename and block sequence mapping stores the namespace of the entire file system directory, and the mapping between data blocks and machine lists is the correspondence between a single data block-9 machine list. Through these two mappings, the client can find the DataNode where"
"mapping stores the namespace of the entire file system directory, and the mapping between data blocks and machine lists is the correspondence between a single data block-9 machine list. Through these two mappings, the client can find the DataNode where the block is located according to the directory information stored in the NameNode. The DataNode deployed on the PC is responsible for the operation and management of its own stored data. The default block size of HDFS is 64 MB. If a large number of small data files are stored in the HDFS file system, the metadata node NameNode will consume too much memory and reduce the performance of the entire HDFS cluster. Therefore, HDFS is optimized for the storage of large data files above PB level. In the pathological consultation system, digital microscopic images often reach hundreds of GB of data, and such a large amount of data requires a storage solution specially designed for massive data. To solve this problem, we adopt a digital microscopic image storage mode based on HDFS architecture, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointHDFS-based digital microscope image storage mode.The system function modules of the clinical medical case information management system include six modules: data integration, document management, template configuration, case retrieval, statistical analysis, and public interface.

"include six modules: data integration, document management, template configuration, case retrieval, statistical analysis, and public interface. The functions and relationships of these six modules in the application are as follows. First, the system extracts the corresponding data from the relational database SQL Server through the data integration function and converts it into data that conforms to the XML format specification. Then, the data are entered into the XML database, and the functions related to the data query of the system, such as document viewing, case retrieval, statistical analysis, and other functions, can be used for the next data query and statistical operation. Among them, the data display style of the document viewing function module needs to be configured with the template configuration function module first, and the XSLT file content is used to configure the display mode, such as horizontal version and vertical version. The structure of the whole system is shown in Figure4. Its relationship with other systems is shown in Figure5[17].Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure diagram of system functions.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe relationship diagram between the clinical medical case information management system and other systems.There are two paths for converting relational data to XML data.

"information management system and other systems.There are two paths for converting relational data to XML data. First, every time the data are queried from the relational database, it is immediately imported into the XML database. Second, all the data in the relational database are queried out, converted into XML data, and then imported into the XML database. The advantage of the first method is seamless connection, but it will delay the time of data integration of the whole system. If an error occurs in the middle of this behavior, the XML database will have to perform a large number of rollback operations, and it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the data and the stability of the system. The second way is to first convert the relational database data into XML data and store it in the hard disk, and then read the XML data from the hard disk and store it in the XML database. This will produce XML data that take up hard disk space and take time to read and write to the hard disk, and the overall time will be a little more than the first method. Then, because the process of exporting and importing data from the relational database to the XML database is separate, if there is a problem in the export process, the data in the XML database may not be affected. Therefore, the system adopts the second data integration method, and the data integration management module architecture is shown in Figure6[18].Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointArchitecture diagram of the data"
"the XML database may not be affected. Therefore, the system adopts the second data integration method, and the data integration management module architecture is shown in Figure6[18].Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointArchitecture diagram of the data integration module.The BaseDao layer calls the XMLConfigClientTemplate class that encapsulates the read database operation statement, and when there is a return result, encapsulate the returned result in a corresponding list or a single object to interact with the database. The function of the XMLConfigClientTemplate class to read the database operation statement is to call the XMLConfigUtil class to read the database operation statement from the database query statement configuration file. In order to realize the independence of database operation statements from Java programs as much as possible, the system places database operation statements in several separate configuration files. Programmers only need to write static operation statements and required dynamic parameters in the configuration file and specify the values of the dynamic parameters in the Java program, and then the XMLConfigUtil class parses and generates the corresponding database operation statements. The operation on the database is to obtain the database session by calling the get XQSession method of the DptXMLDBSessionFactory class.

"organize various data including multimedia resources required by the website. Moreover, the construction and implementation of the clinical medical case information management system will be able to solve the problems of query, storage, and insertion of different unstructured data. In addition, it provides perfect data processing services for the application systems connected to the system, thereby solving the problem that unstructured data cannot be efficiently processed. The clinical medical case information management system mainly uses the powerful processing function of XML database for unstructured data to solve the problem that enterprise unstructured data are difficult to efficiently integrate into the information system, resulting in insufficient overall processing of enterprise data, so that all data can be uniformly and efficiently processed in the information system. This article combines the intelligent data management technology to construct the general surgery clinical information management system. From the experimental statistical results, it can be seen that the general surgery clinical information management system based on intelligent data management proposed in this paper has a good effect.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Zhejiang Taizhou First People's Hospital.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe labeled dataset used to support the findings of this study is available"
