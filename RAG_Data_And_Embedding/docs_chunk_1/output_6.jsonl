"AbstractIn order to study the role of tai chi curve algorithm in economic geography and natural ecological management and explore the application value of tai chi curve algorithm and its model, this study discusses the principle of Chinese tai chi diagram, using mathematical model construction method by the previous tai chi map and Pythagoras theorem clever results, produced the tai chi graphscurve algorithm, and discusses the application value of tai chi curve algorithm and its model from different angles; this study takes Zhangye geography as an example, which provides an applied research direction for the future scientific research of Chinese economic geography and also provides a clever connection with ecological correlation and nature; finally, it is found that the Taiji graphscurve algorithm can calculate the corresponding Yin and Yang values according to the balance point and relative deviation amount of the attribute state, and the results have an extraordinary influence in economic geography, information management system, natural ecology, and other aspects.1. IntroductionTai chi is the category of ancient Chinese philosophy used to analyze the movement laws of celestial bodies and to explain the origin of the world.Since ancient times, tai chi was studied and applied by scholars, said that in early research, it was found that Tai Chi graphics expounded the law of life two, two and three, which is an important graphic expression of yin-yang theory and explained [1]."
"ancient times, tai chi was studied and applied by scholars, said that in early research, it was found that Tai Chi graphics expounded the law of life two, two and three, which is an important graphic expression of yin-yang theory and explained [1]. Chen Shijun (2021) also said that since Zhou Dunyi wrote the Tai Chi diagram in the Song Dynasty, the Tai Chi diagram has a unique significance in the interpretation history of the book of changes. The Tai Chi diagram vividly contains the basic contents of the book of changes, such as Yin and Yang, three talents, four images, five elements, eight trigrams, and nine palaces, reflects the unity of many elements such as image, number, reason, and occupation, and reflects the essence of the book of changes. The \"unity\" principle exists in the theory and the corresponding quantum field principle [2]. The \"correlation principle\" emphasizes \"mutual exclusion and complementarity,\" which happens to be the principle of antagonistic unity revealed in \"one Yin and one Yang.\" Chen and Ma studied how to deconstruct the tai chi figure [3] mathematically. Through the inner circle of the unit square, applying the lever balance principle of Archimedes theorem and the core idea of fuzzy mathematics, thescurve of tai chi diagram can be accurately expressed with a primary function. This argument suggests that tai chi maps can be expressed in mathematical language, rather than without standard geometric maps, expressing the basis for tai chi maps"
"thescurve of tai chi diagram can be accurately expressed with a primary function. This argument suggests that tai chi maps can be expressed in mathematical language, rather than without standard geometric maps, expressing the basis for tai chi maps reflecting the existence and development of things. In the study of Chen and Wang, taking the classic symbol \"Taiji diagram\" as an example, this paper analyzes its morphological characteristics and aesthetic artistic conception and explores its expression and design methods in modern architectural landscape design combined with specific cases [4]. Yu elaborated the application of congenital tai chi diagram (Yin-Yang fish diagram) in opera facial makeup from three aspects: the application of tai chi graphics and colors in opera facial makeup, the position of tai chi diagram in facial makeup, and the relationship between tai chi diagram and background color in facial makeup [5].The form of tai chi mode itself has a good guide to the current economic geography, and thescurve of tai chi map runs through the mathematical wisdom based on Pythagoras in ancient Chinese theorem. The intention of this study is to find tai chi Yin and Yang map in fuzzy mathematics to accurately describe the model value in the information management system of economic geography and natural game and to combine tai chi curve algorithm with economic geography, so as to study the influence of tai chi curve algorithm on social and economic development.2."

Mathematical Model of thesCurves of Tai Chi Figure2.1. Quantitative Model of Tai Chi FigureWe establish a right-angle coordinate system to make a unit circle centered on the coordinate origin. The vertical axis represents the relative offset of the state and is set to A, and the two pointsN(0,δ);BandB′ are the horizontal lines of the over-Npoint and the two intersections of the circle, respectively.

As shown in formulas (1) and (2),(1)(2)Here, the Yin-Yang assignment at this time is also known as the Yin-Yang assignment of pointBorB′ on the circleO. Notably, the Yang assignment is the square of the relative offset corresponding to the projectionOMof theOCon the longitudinal axis.

The Internal Connection between Tai Chi Diagram and the Pythagorean TheoremFor the Pythagorean theorem, the mathematical model is shown in formula:(5)Here,a,b,care the two right and oblique edges of the right triangle, respectively. Starting with the Pythagorean theorem, through the inner cut circle of the unit square, Chen had said that it applies the lever balance principle of Archimedes' theorem and the core idea of fuzzy mathematics; thescurve of the tai chi diagram can be accurately expressed with a primary function. The definition of a circle can also be obtained by the Pythagorean theorem; when the oblique edge is a certain length, the set of two right angular edges is the trajectory of the circle. In the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zhao Shuang, a mathematician in China, created \"the geometric graph on a circle (Figure4)\" [6], as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure"
"length, the set of two right angular edges is the trajectory of the circle. In the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zhao Shuang, a mathematician in China, created \"the geometric graph on a circle (Figure4)\" [6], as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe geometric graph on a circle.In Figure4, ifxandyrepresent the quotient value of the two right-angle edges' square and oblique edges' square, respectively, and this quotient value is defined as the Yang and Yin values of this triangle, respectively.

"(b) Yangzhi result.In Figure6,αis the diagonal ofa. This is perfectly consistent with the Yin-Yang theory and is a perfect combination of algebra and geometry. Connecting the formulas5and (6), we can know its essential connotation is that the area of the square corresponding to the oblique edge of the unit right-angle triangle is equal to the sum of the two square areas corresponding to the two right-angle edges. Chen had said that it can be illustrated by the oasis and the area relationship of the desert. Take Zhangye, Gansu Province, China [6], as shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointArea relationship diagram of Zhangye Oasis Desert.In Figure7, if the total area of Zhangye city is regarded as \"1\" per unit area, then the sum of oasis and desert area is always equal to \"1\" (because in the city, the water is an oasis, and the area with no water is a desert, and the sum remains the same). When one of the areas increases, the product decreases on the other hand, and vice versa, and the set of this change process is a circular trajectory. As shown in formula (6),(8)Here, therefore, the Yin and Yang function remains in dual equilibrium, entangled each other and superposition, just like quantum entanglement, its total value is fixed to \"1.\" The area of each other is their deviation value, and the sum of the deviation value is fixed to \"1.\" In most areas of Zhangye, it is not an oasis which is not a desert, but out of the \"Schrodinger state\" of oasis and desert,"
"total value is fixed to \"1.\" The area of each other is their deviation value, and the sum of the deviation value is fixed to \"1.\" In most areas of Zhangye, it is not an oasis which is not a desert, but out of the \"Schrodinger state\" of oasis and desert, it is impossible to know which attribute is stronger; oasis and desert are in thex+y=1, line section, and are in the [0, 1] range. For any set, there can be two completely opposite set discussions on an attribute, and the economic operation state can also be discussed here and divided into two completely opposite concepts of accumulation and consumption. All objective things that exist can be divided into two opposite sets with subjective attitude. However, the real state of affairs is not black or white, but out of the black and white interval, which is also Marx's dialectical \"divided in two\" of materialism.2.3.

Application of Tai Chi's Curve Model in Ecological EnvironmentNatural ecology has been closely related to tai chi since ancient times. Nature has been growing everywhere. The ecological chain also reproduces and breeds according to this law, and the natural environment also plays a game between living beings. When a population's growth rate has exceeded what the environment can accommodate, the natural environment imposes its growth restrictions, such as sudden food reduction, insufficient land resources, and more natural enemies. Ideally, when the growth amount of the population tribe reaches just half the environmental capacity, the biological growth rate is the fastest, and the distribution amount of food and the environment can just be balanced, which is the most favorable growth value conducive to biological survival.In Table1,Kis the maximum number of populations that can be maintained in a certain space range when the environmental conditions are not damaged;xis the growth rate of the population in this spatial range (all growth rates in the table are compared to the proliferation rate"
"number of populations that can be maintained in a certain space range when the environmental conditions are not damaged;xis the growth rate of the population in this spatial range (all growth rates in the table are compared to the proliferation rate at 1/2 of the environmental capacity).Table  1.Relationship between the total biomass change and growth rate in an area.Total biomassx>K/2x=K/2x<K/2Biological growth rate in this populationReduceNormal growthAccelerateData source: the study was designed by itself.As shown in Table1, the environmental capacity is the whole circle, and biological proliferation rate of an environment is thescurve. When the biological growth rate rises rapidly and peaks, the curve decreases, indicating that the growth rate of the environment has reached saturation, due to food shortage, spouse shortage, and habitat pressure, the number of the organisms will decline sharply, and the number of resources, natural enemies, and the other factors will inhibit it. When the number drops sharply to a certain range, the amount of biological growth increases again. Let the ambient capacity be theKvalue, and the negative and positive values calculated from the equilibrium value of the relative deviation amount will be theK/2.If it fails to develop according to its natural laws, the result will flood like the Australian hare, lack of competition from natural enemies, sufficient food, serious damage to the natural environment to limit its growth, and eventually"
"will be theK/2.If it fails to develop according to its natural laws, the result will flood like the Australian hare, lack of competition from natural enemies, sufficient food, serious damage to the natural environment to limit its growth, and eventually lead to uncontrollable human results.4. Application of Tai Chi Curve Algorithm in Economic GeographyTaiji curve model can also be applied in economic geography, and its model can generally describe the law of industrial layout and the technical and economic scientific development concept of the research objects. The combination of natural technology, science, and economy separated and integrated in the model is indispensable. The three achieve a wonderful balance in urban planning, human activities, and natural ecology.The significance of the model is different between the regions of different scales, and the magic of thescurve model diagram is that it can clearly and thoroughly express the correlation of the variables between various complex systems and draw it in the ancient Chinese tai chi figure.For example, the state allocatesn0.000 yuan to bothAandBcities for the development and construction of its cities. A city, because of the urban economic development, is not as developed asBcity, so most of the allocated funds are used on urban infrastructure construction, and the remaining small part for urban ecological development;Bcity is economically developed city, while the natural resources are far inferior toAcity, soBcity"
"asBcity, so most of the allocated funds are used on urban infrastructure construction, and the remaining small part for urban ecological development;Bcity is economically developed city, while the natural resources are far inferior toAcity, soBcity has invested a lot of money in urban ecological planning, the rest is used in urban economic construction. Table2is drawn as described above.Table  2.The amount use and allocation of urban infrastructure construction and ecological planning between the two cities.Acity allocated economic use (ten thousand yuan)Bcity allocated economic use (ten thousand yuan)Total state appropriation (ten thousand yuan)nnUrban foundation construction (ten thousand yuan)abUrban ecological development (ten thousand yuan)cdData source: the study was designed by itself.In Table2,nis the amount allocated by the state to the two cities;ais the amount used for urban foundation construction inAcity;bis the amount used for urban foundation construction inBcity;cis the amount used inAurban ecological development;dis the amount used for urban ecological development ofBcity:(11)Here, the formula notes are shown in Table2.According to Table2, combined with the tai chiscurve model algorithm used, the total national approval fund is set as the circle constructed, and then the funds used in urban ecological development planning and the funds used in urban economic development and construction will be negative and positive values. According to the balance value of"
"approval fund is set as the circle constructed, and then the funds used in urban ecological development planning and the funds used in urban economic development and construction will be negative and positive values. According to the balance value of the relative deviation value, the funds invested in all parties can be calculated through thescurve model. According to the hook theorem, the total value square remains unchanged, the negative value and positive value balance, the funds used in urban ecological development planning increase, the funds used in urban economic development and construction decrease, and the point collection is the track of the total value circle.Similarly, the use planning of the land area can also be expressed in the model. The land area used in urban use is the fixed value, while the infrastructure facilities of urban development and the land resources needed for urban ecological development are variables, which make the Yin and Yang assignments and use the core idea of fuzzy mathematics to analyze the primary function. Moreover, the construction facilities of urban development are also divided into energy system, communication system, etc. At this time, it needs to be modeling in the urban infrastructure facilities, with the infrastructure is the circular track, while the energy communication system is the variable as the function.5.

"infrastructure facilities, with the infrastructure is the circular track, while the energy communication system is the variable as the function.5. ConclusionThis paper carried out a thorough study on tai chiscurve and the analysis of its combination with Pythagoras theorem, natural ecology, economic geography, and other aspects. As a result, this paper calculated the impacts of the increase and decrease of organisms in natural ecology on the natural environment. In addition, the practical application of economic geography is calculated. Using the relevant knowledge of mathematical modeling, the tai chi theorem and its curve modeling are constructed. Combining game theory and chaos theory, tai chi and Marx's dialectical materialism are discussed.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no potential conflicts of interest in this paper.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data underlying the results presented in the study are available within the article.References1Zhou X.,Wang Chuanshan's construction of ---- \"Tai Chi Tu\",Journal of the University of South China (Social Sciences Edition).

"developed countries in the world regard the development of artificial intelligence as a major strategy to enhance national competitiveness and safeguard national security. Artificial intelligence is the new engine of economic development and the core driving force of a new round of industrial reform. China is a huge agricultural country, and strengthening agriculture's core position is an important part of China's socialist construction with Chinese characteristics. Since the reform and opening-up, China's rural economy has altered tremendously. To develop a rural economic development strategy, guide agricultural machinery industrial production, and promote agricultural mechanization development in China, it is critical to identify the factors influencing agricultural mechanization development as well as the degree of influence of each factor [1]. It will give birth to new technologies and new forms of business, profoundly change the way of production and life and thinking of human beings, and achieve an overall jump in social productivity [2]. With the development of the rural economy, the process of China's agricultural modernization is accelerating.

China is a large agricultural country, and improving agriculture's fundamental position is a key component of China's socialist building with Chinese features. China's rural economic position has changed dramatically since the reform and opening-up. In the new situation, it is critical to identify the factors influencing agricultural mechanization development as well as the degree of influence of each factor in order to develop a rural economic development strategy, guide agricultural machinery industrial production, and promote agricultural mechanization development in China [4]. The application scenarios of speed control technology and extraction method in unmanned plant protection operations are growing more and more comprehensive as intelligent and informationized agricultural machinery and equipment improve. Traditional automated agricultural machinery navigation consists of three major components: position and attitude assessment, path planning, and motion control [5,6].

"machinery and equipment improve. Traditional automated agricultural machinery navigation consists of three major components: position and attitude assessment, path planning, and motion control [5,6]. Agricultural mechanization is an important part of modern agriculture, and the rational and effective utilization of agricultural mechanization information plays an immeasurable role in promoting the development of agricultural mechanization in China [7].Artificial intelligence systems can anticipate which crop to plant in a given year and when to sow and harvest in a given place by analyzing data such as heat, climate, soil, humidity, and crop performance in prior years [8]. As a consequence, this method improves crop yields while using less water and pesticides to promote soil fertility and fight pests. The impact on natural ecosystems may be reduced, and workers can produce more food, lowering food costs and meeting the food demands of an expanding population [9,10]. Rotating machinery and tools typically result in instability because of the visible uneven intensity of components, physical imbalance, and configuration problems throughout operation [11]. Strong vibrations accelerate component degradation, increase replacement time, and cause considerable property loss. Rotating equipment vibration monitoring and fault detection techniques are those that observe and recognise vibration restrictions caused by causes such as imbalance [12,13].

"time, and cause considerable property loss. Rotating equipment vibration monitoring and fault detection techniques are those that observe and recognise vibration restrictions caused by causes such as imbalance [12,13]. Dong et al. studied how coordinating multidisciplinary technologies and reasonably integrating them into the system is the key to the success of intelligent agricultural machinery. According to the requirements of China's land scale management development, intelligent agricultural machinery should make use of advanced aviation and aerospace ground technology to realize high-speed calculation and data information transmission in a dynamic environment and command the executing agency to efficiently and effectively complete the task [14].Jin et al. developed a vibration detection and control system based on intelligent sensor nodes to detect and control the frame vibration caused by high-power engines of agricultural machinery in view of the problem that the vibration of agricultural machinery not only affects the operation quality and effect but also reduces the service life of the machinery. Each intelligent detection node can work independently or can be networked as an Internet of Things system [15]. Precision agriculture is based on the automated navigation technology of agricultural equipment, which can help minimize the amount of labour required for agricultural machinery operators while enhancing implementation efficiency and accuracy [16,17].

"agriculture is based on the automated navigation technology of agricultural equipment, which can help minimize the amount of labour required for agricultural machinery operators while enhancing implementation efficiency and accuracy [16,17]. Mironenko et al. improve the efficiency of agricultural industrial production. The possibility of improving agricultural production efficiency by establishing a hardware-based control system with artificial intelligence elements was analyzed [18]. The growth trends of new agricultural technologies such as artificial intelligence are based on intelligent agriculture, agricultural Internet of Things, and the function of agricultural Internet of Things in intelligent agricultural large-scale systems [19]. The agricultural machinery management system, which is mainly focused on advanced IoT and cloud computing technology, could greatly assist specific organizations in providing greater efficiency and low-price production services to Chinese farmers by implementing remote monitoring stations on smart farm equipment and enhancing mobile application and server software [20,21].2. Application of Artificial Intelligence in Agricultural ProductionAgriculture entails a variety of procedures and phases, the majority of which are performed manually. AI can help with the most complicated and ordinary jobs by supplementing existing technology. When integrated with other technologies, it can gather and evaluate massive data on a digital platform,"
"and phases, the majority of which are performed manually. AI can help with the most complicated and ordinary jobs by supplementing existing technology. When integrated with other technologies, it can gather and evaluate massive data on a digital platform, determine the best course of action, and even take that action. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used in agriculture to provide cognitive solutions in agricultural and field farming technologies [22]. In particular, cognitive computing will become the most disruptive technology in agricultural services. Cognitive computing is able to understand, learn, and respond to different situations, improving efficiency. Microsoft has worked with 17 farmers in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to help them increase the average yield per hectare by 30 percent compared with the same period last year by advising them on sowing, land, and fertilizer.(1)The Internet of things drives production growth: the Internet of Things generates vast amounts of structured and unstructured data every day [23]. The data are related to historical weather patterns, soil reports, new research, rainfall, insect pests, drone and camera images, and so on, to boost yields. Everything that can be operated via the Internet is an Internet of Things (IoT) device. With wearable IoWT (Internet of Wearable Things), IoT devices have grown rather common in consumer markets.

"that can be operated via the Internet is an Internet of Things (IoT) device. With wearable IoWT (Internet of Wearable Things), IoT devices have grown rather common in consumer markets. IoT applications in farming are aimed at traditional farming activities in order to fulfil rising needs and reduce output losses [24]. Robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery, along with ever-improving machine learning and analytical tools, are used in agriculture to monitor crops, survey and map fields, and deliver data to farmers for sensible farm management plans, saving time and money [25].(2)Soil testing: near remote sensing and remote sensing are two technologies mainly used for intelligent data fusion. Both technologies are realized with the help of sensors. In particular, the former requires sensors that are in contact with the soil or very close to the soil so that soil properties can be determined according to the soil below the surface of a specific location. Rowbot, a company dedicated to providing artificial intelligence hardware solutions, has combined data collection software with robotics to prepare the best fertilizer for corn planting to maximize yields.2.1.

"years, in order to meet the requirements of the socialist market economic system, agricultural machinery management departments at all levels have been developing rapidly in the process of deepening reform and transforming functions. Although management departments at all levels have developed some application software, it is not suitable for nationwide promotion due to its strong pertinence (all aimed at specific problems at all levels), long development cycle, and relatively backward technical means. At present, there is no unified application software available for all levels of the country in the agricultural machinery management department. In our nation, Internet and Intranet technologies have been widely employed in information management, and the use of its network database has yielded significant results, but agricultural mechanization information management research is still in its early stages. The application of computer technology and network technology in agricultural mechanization in foreign countries is primarily for farms and agricultural machinery enterprises, and the software developed in our country cannot be directly used in the management of agricultural mechanization information. China's agricultural mechanization management system is a top-down tree structure system since it has its own peculiarities (as shown in Figure1), and each level of the system not only corresponds to the agricultural mechanization management department at the next level but"

"System, Russia's GLONASS, Europe's Galileo, and China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. The common speed measurement methods of GNSS include single-point speed measurement and differential speed measurement. Differential positioning has a fixed and immovable reference station. The reference station transmits the differential correction signal to the onboard mobile receiver through the wireless link. The onboard mobile receiver constantly corrects its positioning error by combining the differential correction information to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. In general, the accuracy of differential velocimetry is higher than that of single-point velocimetry, but similar to differential positioning, its velocimetry accuracy is easily affected by the distance between the receiver and the base station, while the single-point velocimetry system only needs to rely on a single GNSS receiver on the applicator. Considering the particularity and complexity of pesticide application in an orchard environment, this project plans to adopt GNSS single-point velocity measurement method and use the original Doppler observation value to measure velocity so as to achieve the purpose of real-time acquisition of operating vehicle velocity in this project. Pseudodistance observation equation is shown in equation (1):(1)whereis the pseudodistance between satellite and receiver,is the geometric distance between the satellite and the receiver,δti(t) is the clock difference of the receiver at"
"in this project. Pseudodistance observation equation is shown in equation (1):(1)whereis the pseudodistance between satellite and receiver,is the geometric distance between the satellite and the receiver,δti(t) is the clock difference of the receiver at timet,is the time difference of the satellite at timet,is the ionospheric delay,is the tropospheric delay, andεpis the observation noise;By differentiating equation (1), the Doppler velocimetry observation equation can be obtained. In this way, the onboard GNSS receiver operating in the process of the relative position of observation satellite station spacing rate varies depending on the location, in which, the speed of acquisition field, has nothing to do with the choice of frequency speed measuring precision, but the error is influenced by the selected receiver model is more obvious. During the experiment, the GNSS receiver needs to be fixed above the rear of the application vehicle to obtain relatively stable satellite information. Finally, the speed at different moments is determined according to the different satellite signals resolved by the application vehicle at different positions. The choice of core control chip for the GNSS single-point speed measurement system is very important to the whole system. In the process of selecting the core control chip, the actual requirements should be combined with the function of the chip.

"very important to the whole system. In the process of selecting the core control chip, the actual requirements should be combined with the function of the chip. As shown in Figure1, is the comparison of several common single-chip control chip parameters, the MSP430 chip can achieve low power consumption mode, fast running speed, strong processing capacity, and rich resources in the chip, suitable for commercial development and use. STM32 has rich peripheral resources and fast running speed, in line with the development environment requirements of this subject. Table1shows the parameter comparison of the three chips:1.Comparison of parameters of several common microcontroller core chips.Chip modelOwned by the companyCPU (bits)RAM (k)ROM (k)I/OMCS51Intel8512832MSP430TI165-3151248STM32ARM3231512112The core controller of the GNSS single-point velocity measurement system uses ARM Cortex-M3 as the core chip STM32F 103 VET6, which is used to parse the satellite information obtained by the receiver. The number of pins of this chip can meet the requirements of this design. In addition, the chip also has first-class peripheral resources: flash memory size is 512 kB; the main frequency is 72 MHz. It has a maximum operating voltage of 3.6 V, 112 GPIO interfaces, and 3 12 bit ADC conversion units.3.

"3.6 V, 112 GPIO interfaces, and 3 12 bit ADC conversion units.3. Experimental AnalysisThe data before and after Kalman filter fusion are collected, and the comparative analysis is completed. The experimental data obtained from 20 experiments are processed simply to make the obtained data more stable. On this basis, the mean value, root mean square value, and the distribution of error interval of each group of data are analyzed. In order to realize the stable extraction of the speed data of the application vehicle and the fine control of variable application, 10 groups of experiments were carried out in the open environment and the environment covered by trees, respectively. The test distance of each group was 15 m, and the distance between fruit trees was about 2 m. The speed values measured by GNSS at a single point, the number of satellites, DOP values, and the speed values measured by the binocular vision range velocimetry module during the application vehicle's movement were collected in real time. In order to reduce the deviation of experimental data and optimize the structure, the average value of the speed data of more than 1000 sampling points acquired in real time in each group was calculated by sliding window sampling in this experiment. Taking the data collected by GNSS at a single point as an example, the calculation process was shown as follows:(2)whereV11is the first speed data (m/s) after the average value of sampling in the sliding window,Viis the velocity"

In the above formula, the first data result after smoothing is the average value of the data measured by the first five single points of GNSS, and so on, the second data after smoothing is the average value after summing the second value to the sixth value of the single point of GNSS data. The sliding window sampling average value of the binocular vision odometry system is also calculated in this way, taking the data collected in experiment 1 as an example. A total of 1321 data of sampling points were obtained, and the velocity measurement data of the two systems were respectively saved as .CSV files, wherein, the files saved in the binocular vision velocimetry system include minute, second, and binocular velocimetry data. The files saved in the single-point velocity measurement system include the number of receiving satellites, number of pixel points, DOP value, and GNSS real-time speed data.

A comparison of real-time data of GNSS single-point velocity measurement and real-time data of the binocular velocity measurement system is shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure4, under the condition of low-speed driving in GNSS single-point log data, there is a drift phenomenon with high and low speed, and the binocular vision system to measure the data in most cases is relatively stable, with speed generally stable at about 0.2 m/s, occasionally appearing beyond the scope of the high or low, whereas orchard pesticide applying low speed compared with GNSS velocity measurement, C is relatively stable.

The data measured by GNSS at a single point is relatively high at low speed, while at low speed, the number of pixel points obtained by the binocular speed measurement system is relatively stable and the measured data is more authentic. In order to compare the fluctuation of the measured data between the two, the variance of the first group of experiments was analyzed. The variance was the square operation based on the difference between each data and the mean. The smaller the variance was, the more stable the data would be.

The lower the variance, the more stable the data being measured is. When driving at moderate speeds, binocular speed measurement data tends to be quite steady, whereas GNSS speed measurement data fluctuates substantially.4.

"in the near future, considerably improving human lives and bringing tremendous social and economic advantages. Agriculture will enter a new era of digital information under its leadership. It is crucial for encouraging the use of electronic information technology in agricultural machines. The data were compared and examined after and before fusion. The target velocity output after fusion is more stable, with a stability increase of 59.59 percent when compared to single-point GNSS velocity measurement data and an increase of 18.32 percent when compared to data measured by the binocular vision velocity measurement system, according to the results of the analysis. It has achieved the aim of precise speed measuring at all speeds, from low to high. It has specifically addressed issues such as vehicle positioning failure and vehicle skidding caused by trees obstructing GNSS satellite signals during field operations. The data report's automated summary feature prevents data distortion due to human factors while also relieving report workers of tedious work.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentsThe present research work is self-funded.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study will be made available on request.References1Xu Y.,Li J., andWan J.,Agriculture and crop science in China: innovation and sustainability,The Crop Journal.

"AbstractThis paper is based on the alumina ceramic manufacturing process and its quality to build a quality information management system to study alumina ceramics and its quality factors such as physical properties, chemical properties, and other pieces of related information to find a kind of alumina ceramics. The management of quality management brings efficiency and guarantee to the management system. Obviously, this research is based on the two parts of alumina ceramic tube and quality management information system for data acquisition and analysis. One part is based on the production and performance analysis of alumina ceramic tube and summarizes the quality problems that occurred in this process. This paper constructs an information management system to count these issues and conducts research on information dominance and management; among them, exponential smoothing calculation methods, linear trends, convolutional neural algorithms, and so on are applied for methodological analysis. The experimental results show that the lack of corners and uneven corners in alumina production has been greatly reduced, and the maximum probability of uneven corners has been reduced from 9.27 to 5.27. The scrap rate of ceramic tube quality decreased from the highest value of 5.82 to 3.17, and the maximum value of unqualified quality was changed from 5.76 to 3.03.1.

"decreased from the highest value of 5.82 to 3.17, and the maximum value of unqualified quality was changed from 5.76 to 3.03.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of the national economy, the demand for bauxite resources is increasing, especially for high-altitude bauxite [1]. My country's bauxite resources are increasingly scarce, the resource reserves are declining, the contradiction between the supply of high-alumina-rich ore is becoming increasingly prominent, and the bauxite resources restrict the development of the aluminum processing industry. Alumina ceramic material is one of the ceramic materials with the largest production scale and the largest consumption in the world [2]. Alumina ceramics is a kind of ideal heat dissipation and packaging material with excellent performance and is suitable for large-scale integrated circuits and high-power electronic devices. However, its application and development are affected by problems such as difficulty in sintering and easy oxidation. Alumina ceramic material is the best type of material currently developed and used, which have good chemical stability, wear resistance, heat resistance, and excellent mechanical properties, and are used in machinery, wind power, electrical, and construction-electrical engineering. There are many toolkit applications, which have great development and practical value. The preparation of aluminum alloy is one of the first developments in the future [3,4].

"and construction-electrical engineering. There are many toolkit applications, which have great development and practical value. The preparation of aluminum alloy is one of the first developments in the future [3,4]. On the one hand, it is to find low-cost raw materials, reduce product costs, improve manufacturing processes increase output, and shorten metabolism; on the other hand, it is to improve its efficiency and high-temperature equipment [5]. Oxide ceramic materials have excellent strength, hard breaking, absolute dimensionality, heat conduction, high temperature, carving oxidation, and financial loss. The characteristics of Mu Peng and Gao Group are strong. Under the environmental conditions of Yan Meng, F has good high temperature stability and mechanical properties. It attracts attention at the Murake Industrial Building. Oxide ceramic materials mainly include binary oxides, glass ceramics, titanate ceramics, and hydroxyapatite ceramic materials. Binary oxide ceramic materials mainly include silicon oxide, oxide drink, alumina, zinc oxide, and barrel oxide. These ceramic materials are widely used as ordinary daily ceramics and high-tech water ceramics.Information is the main component of the quality management system documents.

"system documents. The technology-based quality information management system also covers the entire life cycle of the product and can effectively use quality information to meet customer needs and expectations for products in a timely manner [6]. The development process of the manufacturing and information industry is an important development process formulated by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Information construction mainly serves the medium and long-term development process of enterprises, screening and identifying macro and microdata, regularly understanding market opportunities, and using relevant competitive actions [7]. Under normal business development conditions, informatization management will become the first choice for the main indicators of the enterprise in the long-term competition [8].Alumina ceramics is a ceramic material that has been widely developed and used at present, and it has good chemical stability. In the process of Shukla M's research, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of Ti-based compounds at the interface of the base material-filler alloy of the microwave and traditional brazing joints. The basic shape of the joint cross section is determined by X-ray energy analysis. The Vickers microhardness measurement shows that the microwave-assisted brazing joint has a reliable joint function in the practical application of electric tubes.

"energy analysis. The Vickers microhardness measurement shows that the microwave-assisted brazing joint has a reliable joint function in the practical application of electric tubes. The brazing force measurement and helium leak test provide evidence for the alignment of the alumina-alumina joint [9,10]. Since there is no universal standard to evaluate the quality of process information, it is necessary for document producers to design appropriate process descriptions to provide practical solutions. In order to achieve the main purpose, Grudzien and Hamrol created a method to examine the characteristics of the influence of the process on the user's information needs of the process documentation and introduced the results of the survey conducted in the enterprise process, aiming at finding the relationship between the attributes of the description information and the process characteristics [11]. Khalilpourazary and Salehi aimed to study the effect of using alumina nanoparticles on the final surface characteristics of Al7175 cylindrical specimens manufactured by the tumbling process. In order to compare the results, the input parameters of the two groups, including workpiece diameter, speed, feed rate, and polishing tool, are all selected the same. In addition, dry and nanofluid polishing, number of passes, and penetration depth are considered as variable parameters in this study [12].

"are all selected the same. In addition, dry and nanofluid polishing, number of passes, and penetration depth are considered as variable parameters in this study [12]. Ryabchikov discussed the organization-related issues of sintering quality management by rationed fuel in a full-cycle steel plant. This work considers the model structure for calculating agglomerate quality index values and shows that one of the most important interference factors that interfere with the effective management of agglomerate quality is the low authenticity of the genotype and chemical composition information of iron currently used. The work gives the possible reasons for this situation, which are related to the consistency of the mine base of the metallurgical plant, the characteristics of the material supply, and their preparation for aggregation [13]. Current methods for modeling such information manufacturing systems (IMS) lack the ability to systematically represent the dynamic changes involved in manufacturing (or creating) IP. Thi and Helfert aim to solve these limitations and propose a modeling method, the IASDO model. It represents a framework for evaluating the quality of the IMS modeling metamodel, comparing the IASDO model with current methods [14].

"methods [14]. Shrivastava research explored the current status of Indian cement company green manufacturing (GM) strategy and provided industrial ecology, methods to reduce energy consumption, environmental impact data collection, manufacturing system design and control, and product and manufacturing system integration. It also reveals the problems in the decision-making system due to the influence of green product design [15]. Waple et al.'s response to NCA3's information management challenges means balancing relevance and authority, complexity and accessibility, and inclusiveness and rigor. Improving the traceability of the data behind the numbers and graphics, designing the public-facing website, managing the hundreds of technical inputs to the NCA, and developing IAQA-compliant guidelines for the 300+ participants were all well thought out, which in many ways embodies a strategic information management approach [16]. Although these studies have certain research significance and value in terms of experimental data and experimental process, from the data point of view, the experimental methods are too simplistic, resulting in the fact that the practicality of the experimental data is still worth discussing; in addition, for alumina ceramic tubes, there are few researches on the quality information management system of the manufacturing process.Observe the appearance of each sample of high-content alumina ceramic material after 20 cycles of freeze-thaw experiments, and"
"for alumina ceramic tubes, there are few researches on the quality information management system of the manufacturing process.Observe the appearance of each sample of high-content alumina ceramic material after 20 cycles of freeze-thaw experiments, and start production; collect, store, and analyze the quality information circulating in the process network and the execution information of each process. Supervise and manage the operation of the quality system to provide information support for the effective operation and continuous improvement of the quality system; on the basis of system identification, quality information entry, storage, requirements, and services are combined to develop a process-based information management system. The basis of institutional changes lies in the analysis and extraction of basic services and related components that are part of the company's system quality. The system administrator should form a detailed change plan. The director of the information center shall approve the change--boutique-boutique--scheme according to the change proposal. The implementation process shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the software development process.

Alumina Ceramic  TubeThe content of each oxide in the ceramic material will affect the comprehensive performance of the ceramic material [17]. With the deepening of scientific research and the gradual maturity of the preparation process of alumina ceramics, people can prepare denser and higher-strength alumina ceramics and use them as structural materials. By the end of the high growth period of ceramics, the commercial status of ceramic material production has changed from traditional manuscripts or automated services to linear and automated manufacturing processes. With the successful preparation of transparent ceramics, General Electric successfully used alumina ceramics to manufacture high-pressure sodium lamps. Alumina ceramic lamps are more resistant to high temperatures than traditional quartz tubes and have much better performance. They are widely used in medical, engine wear parts, tool cutting, and other fields [18]. It is limited to the promotion and application of ceramic alumina. Therefore, solving the brittleness problem of ceramic alumina materials is one of the important ways to promote the application of ceramic alumina materials and solve the brittleness problem of ceramic alumina materials [19]. The alumina ceramic structure is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure"
"of ceramic alumina materials is one of the important ways to promote the application of ceramic alumina materials and solve the brittleness problem of ceramic alumina materials [19]. The alumina ceramic structure is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointAlumina ceramics.The microscopic morphology of ceramics has undergone tremendous changes, from the accumulation of small disordered grains to a large ordered oriented sheet-like stacked structure. When the texture degree is low, ceramics are mainly composed of closely coupled fine-grained matrix grains, in which some oriented large flaky grains are embedded. The particles are tightly combined, and there are no defects such as delamination and large pores. In the fine-grained matrix, the existence of large-size, parallel, and uniformly arranged flake-shaped microcrystalline templates can be clearly observed, indicating that the template has good orientation, which can lay a solid foundation for obtaining high-quality alumina textured ceramics [20,21]. Although the general isostatic press is equipped with a pressure gauge or pressure sensor, it can only observe each pressure process and cannot collect continuous pressure change data and the highest pressure and pressure holding time of each pressure process.

"and pressure holding time of each pressure process. The pressure of the medium (liquid or gas) in a closed container can be transmitted equally in all directions. Information feedback lags behind, quality problems are not easy to find, and there are other shortcomings. Through the measurement of porosity, bulk density, and water absorption, the compactness and sinterability of ceramic materials can be roughly reflected. Density is not only the basic characteristic of ceramic materials but also an important parameter of the microstructure of ceramic materials. Effectively preventing or reducing the quality problems of unqualified product compactness and providing an effective guarantee for the smooth production of products is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. During the preparation of ceramic materials, due to the presence of moisture and air in the blank, some pores will inevitably be generated during sintering. The location of the pores has a significant impact on the performance of the ceramic material. It is very brittle and very sensitive to blemishes and has strong elasticity [22]. This determines its reliability and poor destructive resistance and restricts its further development and high-tech applications. Increase the material strengthσ, reduce the elastic modulusE, and increaseσ/E. In the isostatic pressing process, the highest pressure value and the holding time during the pressing process become the key parameters. The holding time is set as a constant"

Quality Information Management SystemManufacturer quality control plays an important role in chain supply chain management. The quality control stage determines the determination, cost, and delivery date of the purchased product [23]. Therefore, it determines the competitiveness of industrial products in the market. After continuous research and update on quality management, its ideas and methods are also constantly upgraded and gradually developed to a higher level. In the enterprise, the original production management and quality management have not existed. It is the original situation, but these two situations have now been upgraded to the management level.

"With the widespread application of information management systems, its quality problems have become increasingly prominent [24]. In fact, in the construction of a management information system, its quality is an important content throughout the whole process of life information system development. The management information system model is shown in Figure2. The quality of the management information system depends on the quality of development and maintenance of the management information system. People improve the efficiency of software design and the quality of software development through the development and update of technology. People continue to research and develop technology and at the same time transfer the focus of software quality control to the field of control and manage software products and software through effective control of software products. The concept of total quality control has led to a broader definition of quality, that is, the combination of product quality and service quality [25]. Work quality refers to many quality-related activities, that is, methods to ensure product quality and a wide range of quality-related activities to demonstrate product quality metrics [26]. To obtain good product quality, we must focus on quality work and use traditional manual and automatic asset loading to collect quality information through sensors or test equipment, usually represented by descriptive clauses or intellectual property rules, which are difficult to"
"we must focus on quality work and use traditional manual and automatic asset loading to collect quality information through sensors or test equipment, usually represented by descriptive clauses or intellectual property rules, which are difficult to quantify and have low reliability and efficiency. Service is the foundation of service marketing, and service quality is the core of service marketing. Whether it is a production enterprise of tangible products or a service industry, service quality is the magic weapon for an enterprise to win in the competition.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointManagement information system.Product process information is mainly recorded in process cards and other documents, and enterprises can trace back to the specific content of each process of the product, process developers, and reviewers through inquiries on these documents [27]. The accuracy and attractiveness of the information automatically collected by search tools have been greatly improved. It can be described by specific numbers to help people roughly understand the quality situation. This is the development of knowledge-quality information machines.

Experiment Related Work and Data Analysis3.1. Relevant Data for the Production of Alumina Ceramic TubesWith the rapid development of social science and technology, the efficiency and load of machinery used in industrial production are getting higher and higher, and many parts and components fail faster and faster due to wear. Ceramic has excellent mechanical properties, good corrosion resistance, and excellent chemical stability, but its thermal shock resistance is often poor, which limits its application in the preparation of ceramic/s metal elements through casting and inlay systems. Weigh dichloromethane and pour it into a clean beaker, then weigh a dose of anhydrous aluminum chloride and pour it into the beaker, then weigh a dose of isopropyl ether and pour it into the beaker, stir well, and put it in the oven for coagulation. After gelation treatment, an alumina xerogel is obtained, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointPreparation of alumina ceramics.Alumina ceramic materials are widely used as ceramic casings in vacuum capacitors in electric power and power plants.

"of alumina ceramics.Alumina ceramic materials are widely used as ceramic casings in vacuum capacitors in electric power and power plants. The casting methods of alumina ceramic tube include grouting, molding, gel injection molding, isostatic pressing, and other molding methods. The product density of isostatic pressing is high, generally 5-15 higher than that of one-way and two-way pressing. The density of the compact is uniform. Because the density is uniform, the length-diameter ratio can be made unlimited, which is beneficial to the production of rod-shaped and tubular thin and long products. Through the technological advantages of informatization construction, change the traditional control position, improve the key competitiveness, and maintain a good development culture. Therefore, the structural problem of the ceramic tube in the manufacturing process is raised. The structure and performance of alumina ceramics are shown in Table1, and the dimensions of some alumina ceramic tubes are shown in Table2. The volume measurement value of alumina ceramics increases with the increase of the erosion angle, reaching the maximum value at 90° and the minimum value at 30°, reflecting the characteristics of typical brittle materials. At small angles, cutting wear is the main cause. The energy of the abrasive is sufficient to cause the alumina ceramic to fracture in the grain boundary area, which makes the small alumina grains easy to fall off and cause volume loss. Due to the"
"At small angles, cutting wear is the main cause. The energy of the abrasive is sufficient to cause the alumina ceramic to fracture in the grain boundary area, which makes the small alumina grains easy to fall off and cause volume loss. Due to the different expansion coefficients of the embedded whiskers/strings and the matrix, when the welding wire is encountered during the crack propagation process, the propagation direction of the crack is blocked, rotation or bifurcation occurs, and the extension of the welding process increases the rigidity.Table  1.Composition and properties of alumina ceramics.Chemical compositionParameter (%)Physical propertiesParameterAluminum>94Density3.42Silica<2.4Apparent porosity0.31Iron trioxide<1.9Compressive strength277Monovalent oxide<0.6Refractoriness1721-1810Table  2.Dimensions of some alumina ceramic tubes.ModelInside diameter ofLengthWall thicknessMaximum outer diameterNC2406.29 ± 0.189.7 ± 10.69 ± 0.057.13NG3907.27 ± 0.1105.3 ± 10.70 ± 0.058.12NG600-38.13 ± 0.1176.2 ± 20.74 ± 0.049.01NG600-47.08 ± 0.1181.2 ± 20.74 ± 0.047.96NG99910.24 ± 0.1186.9 ± 20.74 ± 0.0411.12Alumina injection molding provides powdery materials according to different product requirements and different brewing processes.

"The particle size of the powder is below 1μm. If high-alumina ceramic products are manufactured, in addition to 99.99% alumina matrix, ultrafine coating and uniform particle size distribution are also required. During extrusion or injection molding, clay and plasticizer must be injected into the powder, usually a thermoplastic or resin with a density ratio of 10-30%. The organic mixture should be at a temperature of 150-200 degrees, and the mixed mixture is at the bottom to facilitate work. The oxidation of alumina at different temperatures varies with time, as shown in Figure4. The applied pressure will vary with the amount of filling powder, which can easily cause the difference in shrinkage after softening, which will affect the quality of the product. Generally speaking, the smaller the particle size of the mineral, the better the mechanical properties of the filler material. For example, for the particle added to the rubber, the smaller the particle size, the greater the tear strength. But at the same time, the smaller the particle size is, the more difficult it is to achieve its uniform dispersion. In addition, the smaller the particles, the greater the oil absorption value, the more the additives required, and the higher the processing cost. The filling of the mold is uniform during the dry pressing process. The normal sintering amount of ceramic alumina has a great influence on the size control.

"the processing cost. The filling of the mold is uniform during the dry pressing process. The normal sintering amount of ceramic alumina has a great influence on the size control. Although the alumina ceramic tube has met the requirements in structure after sintering, it still does not meet the application requirements. It needs to be processed by size correction, polishing, and so on to make the surface of the ceramic tube more dense and smooth and further enhance the performance. The final product is formed. The relevant data of general alumina ceramic formulations are shown in Table3.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointOxidation of alumina at different temperatures.Table  3.Formulation of general alumina ceramics.Aluminous rock (%)Kaolin (%)Quartz sand (%)Alumina (%)Water content (%)Resting time (day)52.1413.6723.4711.2401-458.3733.2431.981.3901-458.9130.29317.41.476.551-466.2927.0141.531.5418.241-4The ceramic alumina body is decomposed at 600°C and then sintered at different temperatures (1200°C to 1500°C) to allow the ceramic bone to pass through. The higher the temperature, the lower the porosity of the ceramic process and the larger the average grain size. In addition to relying on electrostatic precipitation between particles to prevent particles from approaching and invading, it can also build a material barrier around the particles to increase the space between the particles to achieve stable dispersion.The increase in porosity will increase the overall flux,"
"particles to prevent particles from approaching and invading, it can also build a material barrier around the particles to increase the space between the particles to achieve stable dispersion.The increase in porosity will increase the overall flux, which corresponds to the increase in suction capacity, but its flexural strength will decrease, which will affect the service life of the support. In addition, due to the high cost of raw materials and the high cost of high-temperature firing, the price of ceramic supports has been high, which has led more and more researchers to pay attention to the research on the preparation process of high-performance and low-cost ceramic supports. To this end, this study tested four types of alumina ceramic samples, the basic conditions of which are shown in Table4.Table  4.Four formulations of alumina ceramic samples for testing.SampleDry weightWet weightBulk densityPorosityWater absorptionA321.67322.572.370.590.23B358.24360.172.570.880.48C311.29322.872.053.742.36D317.89333.391.785.923.94Through the detailed analysis of the above-mentioned formula of ordinary alumina ceramics and the four formulas of the test alumina ceramic samples, we can make an inference about the specific formula components so as to improve the actual formula ratio.

This distribution is unstable in terms of force, and the two particles must overcome the potential barrier to achieve perfect stability. The mechanical method of granular ceramic body weight and solid material casting is called sintering. Sintering is the process of removing the gaps between the particles in the green body, removing a small amount of gas and impurities, and making the particles grow and combine with each other to form a new substance. The data on the interoperability, correctness, reliability, efficiency, and completeness of the alumina ceramic tubes made by these four formulas are shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe performance of the four formulations.The traditional grinding process is difficult to process ceramic structural parts with high efficiency. With the increase of ball milling time and the smashing of large-size particles, there is a better particle gradation between ceramic particles, which reduces internal friction and viscosity when the slurry flows; in addition, another main function of ball milling is to mix materials.

Therefore, research on stone grinding wheels with good performance is of great significance for improving the quality and efficiency of ceramic materials and promoting the reputation and application of this technology. Use big data regression technology to analyze the performance of 20 alumina ceramic tube samples from a factory, as shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance of alumina ceramic tube.The data in the above figure is mainly for the maintainability, adaptability, usability, testability, and so on of alumina ceramics, showing that it can still maintain good stability, wear resistance, high temperature resistance, high hardness, and so on, and when cutting, there will be no chemical reaction with the workpiece.3.2. Construction and Application of Quality Information Management SystemThe quality chain has been further developed under the integrated environment of the global technology system and the rapid development of information technology. With the increasing promotion of the concept of total quality control and the implementation of ISO9000 standards, traditional quality control will surely pass regulations. Due to globalization, different regions, cultures, companies, and companies around the world can establish partnerships to improve progress and speed response to customer needs."
"ISO9000 standards, traditional quality control will surely pass regulations. Due to globalization, different regions, cultures, companies, and companies around the world can establish partnerships to improve progress and speed response to customer needs. The plan for arranging improvement standards is mainly to adopt a development perspective to deal with the obtained test results, that is, to preserve the experience that can achieve good results and to form a standardized guidebook to set a benchmark for future work. The statistical data is to aim at the satisfaction of major customers, product sales, market share, and so on, with the help of this information to obtain good product quality judgments. Before starting a new business, you first need to judge whether to use project management well. After the project is launched, organization, planning, and project management can only follow the basic and basic methods of project management in order to achieve the success of the project. Quality assurance is the basis for all the concepts and performance of the implementation plan to meet the requirements of the quality plan. It is a reliable guarantee for the normal operation of the project quality system and should run through the entire process of project implementation. There is a causal relationship between quality and cost. Quality is one of the life elements of an enterprise, and continuous improvement of product quality is the eternal theme that most enterprises strive"
"the entire process of project implementation. There is a causal relationship between quality and cost. Quality is one of the life elements of an enterprise, and continuous improvement of product quality is the eternal theme that most enterprises strive for. There is a price to be paid for improving quality, whether it is improving tangible products (physical products) or intangible products (services or jobs). The frequency of product replacement is accelerated, and the continuous investment in quality cost is inevitable. Quality cost exists objectively in all aspects of production and operation of an enterprise. The input of quality cost should not only meet the relative needs of customers but also meet the internal requirements of enterprises to increase profits. These two factors restrict each other and constitute the basic contradiction of the development and change of quality cost. The data before and after the application of the constructed information management system are compared and analyzed. First, statistics are made on the production overview of alumina ceramic tubes, such as missing corners, size differences, and uneven corners, as shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverview of alumina production.The data in the above figure shows that the lack of corners and uneven corners in the production of alumina has been greatly reduced.

"production.The data in the above figure shows that the lack of corners and uneven corners in the production of alumina has been greatly reduced. The maximum probability of uneven corners has been reduced from 9.27 to 5.27; the key to preparing high-purity alumina ceramics is to control the number of impurities introduced, and the grinding media is one of the main sources of pollution of the raw materials; therefore, how to overcome the brittleness of the material and improve the toughness has become the main issue in the production of alumina materials. During the sintering process, the number of grain boundaries and the area of grain boundaries will gradually decrease, resulting in a relative increase in the impurity composition at the grain boundaries, resulting in a decrease in the eutectic temperature of the microdomains, and liquid phases are prone to appear. The liquid phase enters the particles to provide lubrication for the reconstitution of the particles in the initial stage of dissolution. However, during the production process, process-related information also needs to be studied, such as furnace plate collapse and unreasonable process. The comparison of data before and after is shown in Figure8.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointAlumina ceramic tube process.A large number of studies have shown that adding Ni as a binder phase will increase the plasticity of ceramic materials, and the flexibility of ceramic materials has a great relationship with the added"
"figure viewerPowerPointAlumina ceramic tube process.A large number of studies have shown that adding Ni as a binder phase will increase the plasticity of ceramic materials, and the flexibility of ceramic materials has a great relationship with the added value. As the amount of Ni increases, the tensile strength of ceramic materials will also increase. At the same time, the hardness of the ceramic material will gradually decrease. However, if the content of Ni is excessive, brittle phases will be formed in the ceramic material. Therefore, after the experiment is carried out on this basis, the quality of the alumina ceramic tube will be counted for cracks, intercalation, and so on, as shown in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointFinished alumina ceramic tube.The generally constructed quality system framework is based on the life cycle of the product, from the material entering the factory, production, leaving the factory, and delivery links, and lacks the construction of information system for quality management activities. In addition, the construction of a systematic quality system is mainly based on the use of products. Because the existing quality records of the factory have not been fully electronically managed, it is difficult to process paper record information. If you want to count the quality information, you need to manually check a large number of paper files. The quality information on the file data also needs to be manually entered into the computer"
"it is difficult to process paper record information. If you want to count the quality information, you need to manually check a large number of paper files. The quality information on the file data also needs to be manually entered into the computer system to facilitate analysis and statistics, and these tasks will cost a lot of manpower and material resources. The main method of management information quality technology is control. Only when accurate and complete information is grasped in time, project management and decision-making personnel have a reliable basis to implement effective control and management of the project. From the data of reject rate and unqualified quality, the application of quality information management system is generally effective, as shown in Figure10.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe quality of alumina ceramic tube.European and American countries are in a leading position in terms of quality information management systems. Research started early, and practical applications are relatively extensive. Since China's reform and opening up, the western advanced management experience has been gradually applied, and the term information system has also begun to appear in China. With the deployment of computers and the establishment of local corporate networks, a central application platform for quality inspection information is provided.

"of computers and the establishment of local corporate networks, a central application platform for quality inspection information is provided. In order to meet the needs of rapid growth of enterprises and the pursuit of product quality, the quality inspection information system has become an important part of the rapid growth of enterprises. From these 15 tests, the scrap rate of alumina ceramic tubes has decreased from the highest value of 5.82 to 3.17, and the maximum value of unqualified quality has changed from 5.76 to 3.03.4. DiscussionFor quality management, it is a large-scale, complex, and systematic project. At present, there is still a big gap between the alumina ceramic tube production technology and foreign advanced technology. It is on the eve of continuous exploration, improvement, and breakthroughs, and the problems faced are more and more complicated. At the same time, with the rapid development of information technology, the application of computers in the field of quality control has received widespread attention in the world, and it is an important way to improve the efficiency of enterprise quality control. Due to the rapid development of technology and craftsmanship, products have become more and more complex and multiplied.

"complex and multiplied. The failures and failures of these products always bring huge losses to users and society. Speed is needed to improve quality and reduce failure rates. Quality improvement is the foundation for the growth and stability of corporate strategic interests. For enterprises, improving product quality can increase product share and form a virtuous circle. The main areas of project quality control include quality, time, and cost. Project quality assurance is one of the main areas of project management. The quality control of the project is very important to ensure the successful completion of the project in accordance with the requirements set by the model and to enable all tasks of the project to be carried out in accordance with the original quality and quality requirements. Quality management is based on quality and quality control. Quality assurance and quality improvement are the success of the quality assurance system.5. ConclusionWith the development of information technology, computers and networks are slowly used in factories to automatically store process information, and it can be promoted and applied. With the rapid development and progress of science and technology, especially computer and network technology, people continue to adopt more advanced methods to improve work performance, to obtain or maintain competitive opportunities in order to maintain sustainable survival and development capabilities.

"technology, people continue to adopt more advanced methods to improve work performance, to obtain or maintain competitive opportunities in order to maintain sustainable survival and development capabilities. The development of the global economy is a transition from growth to growth. The quality control function of the current system is very weak, and it can only manage and analyze the quality after the fact, and it is difficult to prevent the quality beforehand. It is impossible to achieve continuous improvement of the quality system. The information provided by the quality control system can be used to adjust and manage the production process to ensure that the production meets the required product quality. In general, the most fundamental reason why oxide ceramics are difficult to sinter is that the oxide itself has large lattice energy and a relatively stable structure, so the high activation energy barrier must be overcome during the sintering process. The combination of information technology and the operation of ceramic enterprises has itself become an important part of the improvement of ceramic enterprises' technical capabilities. A degree of sharing, transparency, openness, and exchanging distinguishes the traditional departmental function management structure.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon"

"AbstractA strong basis has been set for the digitization of school management by the growth of big data and the Internet. However, there is not specialised software that can be used in schools to handle teaching materials and carry out teaching activities, particularly in school physical education. Most teachers struggle with significant information management issues in the conventional college sports management information system. Along with people's interest in physical education in colleges and universities, the study of the college sports management information system's development plan has emerged as the primary research area in the present day. The use of data mining in the development strategy of the sports management information system was therefore considered in conjunction with the actual situation of school sports information management. The experiment also introduced and provided a detailed explanation of the algorithm used in data mining. To fully explore the system strategy's development impact was the specific goal. In order to realise the management function of the sports management information system, serve the information management of each school, increase information management efficiency by 6.58%, and improve user satisfaction; data mining was introduced into the development strategy of management information system through the discovery of experimental data.1.

"and improve user satisfaction; data mining was introduced into the development strategy of management information system through the discovery of experimental data.1. IntroductionPeople are paying greater attention to the information management system development strategy in colleges and universities as a result of the advantages of the Internet of Things that are continually emerging. Additionally, there is a growing need for sports information management at colleges and universities. However, the current college information management system's information management efficiency is insufficient to adequately meet users' expectations for sports information management. Analysis of the sports management system's development strategy using data mining technologies is therefore very important from a practical standpoint.The methods used in information system development have been extensively examined. Lu examined the management of physical education teaching in its current state, emphasised the value of data mining in physical education instruction, and suggested a strategy for building a teaching management system [1].

"between accidents, which expanded the scope of the index analysis [2]. In order to create a cloud application platform model based on the quantity of computing resources, Wang evaluated the factors that led to the successful development of the sports education management system and integrated the concept of cloud computing [3]. In order to determine the main development direction of the International Olympic Movement in today's rapidly changing reality, Miakonkov and Enchenko employed a systematic analysis approach to identify key forward trends in the International Olympic Movement, revealing risks associated with the implementation of the goals set by the IOC [4]. Ikeda et al. developed a multimodal strategy board tool to improve Japan's competitiveness in goal kicks. It was a team sport for visually impaired players. The tool consisted of an image processing system that determines the position and movement of the ball, and a strategy board that provides tactical information [5]. A smart phone-based training information management system was created by Wang to make it easier for users to use so that they can obtain various kinds of training knowledge information [6]. To achieve high quality development, it is necessary to establish a team of teachers with a high level of professional and technical guidance.

"to establish a team of teachers with a high level of professional and technical guidance. On the basis of analyzing the lack of depth in the current construction of college teachers, Warsono et al. proposed some strategies for improving the professional management team of college teachers [7]. The research results on sports information management system have been very rich, but in the process of research, many problems have been excavated.Data mining is involved in various fields. 2.5D fighting games will be a challenging task due to the ambiguity of visual appearance such as character height or depth. Helma et al. created an OpenAI-gym-like game environment based on the network and proposed a learning Novel Networks [8]. Each machine learning and data mining technique is briefly described in a tutorial by Buczak and Guven [9]. The security of sensitive personal data is under jeopardy as a result of data mining technology's rising popularity and growth. Data suppliers, data collectors, data miners, and decision makers are the four different user categories that Xu et al. identified as being involved in data mining applications [10]. Chaurasia and Pal examined breast cancer data from the Wisconsin dataset of UCI Machine Learning [11] in order to create precise breast cancer prediction models using data mining techniques.

"[11] in order to create precise breast cancer prediction models using data mining techniques. Through their research, Yan and Zheng discovered that several basic signals continued to be significant predictors of cross-sectional stock returns even when data mining was taken into account [12]. In addition to study areas where analogous tools were being employed by the larger data mining and data science communities, Slater et al. described some of the tools emerging in educational data mining research and practise [13]. To continue combating the increase in malware samples, Ye et al. investigated intelligent malware detection methods [14]. Many people have done a lot of research on data mining technology, but few people realize the important role of applying data mining technology to college sports information management system.Although there is a wealth of study on data mining and management information system development methodologies, outcomes that combine the two are extremely scarce. This paper combines the two in an effort to support information management. The goal of the research on the development of the information management system and its development plan is to boost the system's information management effectiveness and guarantee information security.2.

"and guarantee information security.2. Data Mining Technology2.1. Data Mining StructureThe main purpose of this paper is to use data mining to study the development strategy of sports management information system. However, without understanding the structure of data mining technology [15], it is difficult to use this technology to analyze the development strategy of management system. For this reason, the data mining structure is firstly analyzed, and the specific data is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe data mining structure is divided into three parts: data modeling part, tool utilization part, and data query part. In the data modeling part, firstly, it needs to prepare the relevant data to prepare the data foundation for building the model. After the model is built, it needs to be evaluated and interpreted. Only when the evaluation effect of this model is relatively good can this model be used and consolidated. At the same time, it is also necessary to predefine a sports information management report so that users can query in time. In the tool utilization part, data mining tools and report query tools are mainly used. A professional mining tool can provide solutions to problems in a specific field. When it comes to algorithms, the particularity of data and requirements is fully considered and optimized.

"it comes to algorithms, the particularity of data and requirements is fully considered and optimized. The report query tool can automatically calculate the corresponding statistical report according to the data in the management information system, and can create a report template that reflects the law between the data and the report. The sports information report can be automatically calculated in real time in the application based on the information in the current database as long as the parameters are supplied. Model library, database, and data warehouse are the three key modules that make up the data query portion. The model library is a model storage facility created for query reporting and data mining tools. In addition, this model library can make use of the data in relevant databases and data warehouses. According to the report query tool, the database acts as a kind of transfer station for information data that the data warehouse needs. The following is the general framework of data mining, and the data warehouse supports data mining tools.2.2. Data Mining StrategyData mining has the potential to significantly lower the cost of managing information by properly locating query users, predicting their information demands, and providing user satisfaction. Without knowledge of the specific data mining strategy, the use of data mining theory is limited, and it is impossible to perform experiments on the information management system development strategy using data mining"
"and providing user satisfaction. Without knowledge of the specific data mining strategy, the use of data mining theory is limited, and it is impossible to perform experiments on the information management system development strategy using data mining technology to its fullest potential [16]. As can be seen in Figure2, this research undertakes a thorough analysis of data mining techniques.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure2shows the three main strategies in the data mining strategy, namely: unsupervised clustering [17], guided learning, and shopping basket analysis. Among them, guided learning includes three parts: classification, estimation, and prediction. Unsupervised clustering is a modeling framework in data mining. It can only be clustered into a specified number of classes, but it cannot explain the representative meaning of each class. The peculiarity of this strategy is that the algorithm used is simple and flexible enough to give reasonable results for most problems. Guided learning refers to a method of learning that is systematically guided by prescribed procedures. The information can be classified and estimated in detail according to the system guidance, and the user's query needs can be accurately predicted. Therefore, it can be applied in detail in the development strategy of the college sports information management system.

"Therefore, it can be applied in detail in the development strategy of the college sports information management system. Shopping basket analysis refers to a method for correlation analysis based on big data of user behavior. It can be based on basket data of all customers over a period of time. By analyzing the technical means of data mining, it can be found the hidden correlation law, which can help college sports to manage according to the correlation of its information.2.3. General Process of Data MiningThe data mining technology does not end simply by screening the management information data once, but gradually penetrates into the depths of the data through multiple data screening and review. The specific data mining process is shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure3shows the seven steps of the general process of data mining: information evaluation, information understanding, data understanding, data preparation, data modeling, data evaluation, and policy deployment. First, data mining tools perform information evaluation operations on the collected relevant information. The purpose of this is to prevent some management information that does not belong to sports from being mixed in, so that the subsequent information understanding steps will be wrong. Information understanding is to conduct a deeper analysis of the evaluated information in order to obtain relevant data for research.

"information understanding steps will be wrong. Information understanding is to conduct a deeper analysis of the evaluated information in order to obtain relevant data for research. In the data understanding step, it is necessary to understand the relevant data collected from the information, and the purpose of this is to prevent the occurrence of data collection errors. For example, the information collected in college sports information is a girl's height and weight and what she usually likes to eat, then the data collected are gender, height, and weight. The data on what girls usually like to eat does not belong to the scope of this data collection. Until the data understanding step, the data preparation work is completed. Data preparation, data modeling, data assessment, and policy deployment all build on the previous steps. Only when the first few steps are done well, can the work flow of the latter steps be relatively smooth, which in turn promotes the deployment of the development strategy of the university information management system.2.4. Working Process of Data Mining in the Management SystemThe development plan of a collegiate sports information management system can only be better researched by people who comprehend how data mining technology in sports management systems works [18].

In order to do this, Figure4of this paper's general research on the operation of data mining in the management system is shown.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe data mining analysis layer, the data processing storage layer, and the data acquisition layer are three distinct examples of data mining in the information management system shown in Figure4. The web server serves as the primary foundation for the data mining analysis layer, which also includes tools for data mining and information analysis. The primary foundation for the data processing and storage layer is the data warehouse. This data warehouse includes a model library, knowledge base, method library, and other databases. For more convenient management of the data in the data warehouse, this layer additionally offers a warehouse management function. In the data acquisition layer, internal information systems, internal Internet of Things systems, external systems, and other systems are generally present. These systems provide solid technical support for data extraction, cleaning, processing, conversion, and synthesis. On the whole, the data that has been extracted, cleaned, processed, transformed, and synthesized is the main data source of the data warehouse in the data processing storage layer. And each database in the data processing and storage layer provides analysis targets for the tools in the data mining analysis layer.3. Application of"

And each database in the data processing and storage layer provides analysis targets for the tools in the data mining analysis layer.3. Application of Data Mining in Management SystemAutoregressive models are typical modern parametric models whose autoregressive parameters contain important information about the state of the system. In time series modeling, autoregressive models are the most mature and widely used [19]. Using the autoregressive model to extract features from the data, its autoregressive parameters and residuals can be obtained as eigenvalues. When applying data mining in college sports information management, it mainly starts from this autoregressive model.In the autoregressive model, the first step is to use the fitting formula to perform differential fitting on the time series. And this fitting formula represents the formula that the value at any moment in the random time series can be used to fit [20]:(1)wherexis the autoregressive parameter of the model,Pis the model order, andg(n) is the residual error of the model.The autoregressive model determines its own order based on the final prediction error criterion, and the calculation formula of the final prediction error criterion is:(2)wherenrefers to the length of the sample set.

If thePvalue is too small, it means that the autoregressive model fits the time series better.Principal component analysis is an important method in statistical analysis methods and is currently widely used in feature selection and data dimensionality reduction [21]. For this reason, it is more suitable for the development strategy of college sports information management system.Assuming that the data setMincludesnsamples, each sample containspdimensions, then:(3)A new indicatorF= [F1, ⋯,Fn] is established, which is thep-th principal component of the original variable, then:(4)whereuppis the weighting coefficient, the new indicatorsFare not correlated, and their variances decrease in turn.Getting the contribution rates for each component is essential to understanding the principal component analysis algorithm.

And sometimes in information management, it is necessary to input voice information because of the information, but the current voice input has certain defects, and the dynamic time rounding algorithm can effectively overcome this limitation. The dynamic time rounding algorithm is based on dynamic programming and can effectively measure the similarity between two time series of different lengths.The length of the time series is:(8)The dynamic time rounding path is set to:(9)The dynamic time rounding path must start from 1 and end at the end of the time series.
