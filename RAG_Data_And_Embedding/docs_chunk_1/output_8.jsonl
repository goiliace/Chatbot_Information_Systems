"centralized network management mode performs effective prevention, correction, and other management functions according to the global information of the wireless sensor network. On the basis of the above, WinMS proposes the management function of transmission system resources, that is, sending network resources for other parts. WinMS activity is dependent on the specific sensor network model.MARWIS is a heterogeneous wireless sensor network management architecture, which was proposed by Wagenknecht et al. In a heterogeneous wireless sensor network environment, MARWIS common management tasks are update program code, monitoring, and configuration. At the same time, the backbone network of the system is a mesh structure, which allows the heterogeneous sensor network environment to operate. It belongs to the gateway of each heterogeneous subnet. The subnet contains all kinds of the same sensor nodes. The mesh gateway is a prerequisite for subnet communication.2. Related WorkAt present, the sensor network has designed a research model with reference to the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model of the existing network [22], as shown in Figure1, which can be divided into the following layers: one is the physical layer; the other is the data link layer; the third is the network layer; the fourth is the transport layer; the fifth is the application layer.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointResearch network model of the wireless sensor network.With the in-depth"
"layer; the other is the data link layer; the third is the network layer; the fourth is the transport layer; the fifth is the application layer.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointResearch network model of the wireless sensor network.With the in-depth research, the sensor network system is further refined, as shown in Figure2, which is the wireless sensor network architecture. The new architecture is still composed of network protocol stack and management platform, but two parts of positioning and clock synchronization are added to the protocol part, and topology, QoS, and network management platform are added to the management platform, making the system more in line with wireless sensor networks.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointWireless sensor network architecture.From the analysis of the location level, the clock and positioning synchronization sublayers are in a special position in the protocol stack. They run through the communication protocol (three layers) and rely on data to cooperate with the transmission channel, that is, to synchronize the clock and positioning. On the other hand, it can be a network protocol. Necessary synchronization information and location at all levels in the system should be provided. Each protocol layer should be assisted to realize functions more effectively.The newly added QoS management subplatform is responsible for tasks such as queue management, bandwidth allocation, and service priority configuration in each protocol layer,"
"Each protocol layer should be assisted to realize functions more effectively.The newly added QoS management subplatform is responsible for tasks such as queue management, bandwidth allocation, and service priority configuration in each protocol layer, and the topology control and management subplatform is responsible for the network topology, providing the necessary topology for the physical layer, MAC layer, and network layer [23]. Information, a good network topology will effectively improve the efficiency of the protocol. The construction of network topology depends on the effective operation of physical layer, MAC layer, and network layer protocols. The network management subplatform regularly collects the operating status and traffic information of the protocol, is responsible for the information interfaces embedded in each layer of the protocol, and also undertakes the task of coordinating the operation of each protocol component of the network.As a two-way wireless communication technology, Zigbee technology mainly has the advantages and characteristics of low cost, low power consumption, simplicity, and short distance [24]. It is widely used in the field of remote control and automatic control and is formulated to meet the wireless network of small and cheap equipment.

"the wireless network of small and cheap equipment. Zigbee technology is based on the IEEE802.15.4 standard and has developed an application protocol that can be shared among different manufacturers. In the working state of Zigbee technology, the amount of data that can be transmitted is small and the transmission rate is low, so the time for sending and receiving signals is short. On the contrary, in the nonworking state, Zigbee is in a dormant state. Zigbee has the advantages of low transmission power consumption, high data reliability, and low cost. The characteristics of Zigbee technology make it show great advantages in some aspects. Its starting point is to build a low-cost wireless network that is easy to deploy. The main application fields are industrial control, medical equipment control, military, agriculture, and other fields.3. Financial Management System Template Design3.1. General Ledger SectionThe general ledger section is the core of the accounting module. Basic elements such as accounting subjects, accounting periods, currency, and book sets in the system are set in the general ledger section [25].

Since the financial information of the enterprise will be automatically posted to the general ledger section through the system and other submodules will also share data with the general ledger section, the general ledger section should be the best platform for querying company information, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointWireless sensor network architecture.3.2. Accounts Receivable SegmentThe accounts receivable section is mainly used to manage the customer's current business and business collection and settlement business, including managing and saving customer data and information, issuing sales invoices integrated with the BOSS system, and managing customer accounts receivable and payment collection information, record receipt vouchers, and control the aging of customer arrears [26,27]. At the same time, the accounts receivable section can automatically import the data of the business daily report interface provided by the BOSS system into the business accounts receivable invoice and import the bank receipt information into the accounts receivable section through this interface and then batch verification of invoices received.

Construction of Financial Management SystemIn order to facilitate the administrator to better manage the network and ensure the safe, reliable, and normal operation of the network, especially in the case of a harsh environment, it is very special to develop a reliable and safe network management software, importantly,(1)Configuration function: this function can mainly complete the setting of the network topology and can modify the relevant network parameters, restart the network and other functions, improve the management of the network, and ensure that the network is in a good state.(2)Topology"

This function is able to store not only information related to node data but also status information.(4)Troubleshooting function: this function can have a real-time fault alarm function and can set a fault valve area. If there is an abnormality during the network operation, such as when the node in the network is disconnected, the data packet is lost, the node energy is exhausted, and so on, the software can make corresponding processing according to different faults and notify the relevant management personnel in time or deal with it according to the previously set method.(5)Query function: provide users with a variety of query interfaces, and users can easily grasp the actual situation of the network operation through the software.To sum up, the wireless sensor network management software has the responsibility of maintaining and managing the entire network.

"management software has the responsibility of maintaining and managing the entire network. In other words, it can supervise the entire network to ensure that the entire network can be in a normal operation state at all times, and at the same time, it can collect abnormal information in the network. The following describes the functions of the sensor network management software and other situations.The geographic location of the WSN management software in the entire network is shown in Figure6. The client can directly interact with user information and has the function of displaying and configuring tasks; the server is responsible for collecting and processing data in the network management software. The network management software will not affect the actual application of WSN; it can be completely independent of the application system, but directly read the required data from the base station.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointCore functions and business flowchart of accounts receivable segment.4.1.

Cluster Establishment StageThe selection of cluster heads at this stage should clearly affect the three factors that affect the selection of cluster heads: the first is the remaining energy of the node, the second is the distance of the cluster center, and the third is the current actual communication radius, and the node capability functionFomdbiltshould be fully considered:(4)whereDis the distance, which is used to describe the distance between the cluster center and the node. Here, it is assumed that the location of the network node has been determined by the positioning algorithm;Eis used to describe the remaining energy of the node;Ris the radius of the node's current communication, that is, the node under the current transmitting power. The distance of transmission information,r1,r2, andr3are used to refer to the proportion of each part, and the sum of the three is exactly equal to 1. It is worth mentioning that each proportion needs to be set in advance.4.3. Data Communication PhaseThe algorithm was first proposed by Chandrakasan et al.

"worth mentioning that each proportion needs to be set in advance.4.3. Data Communication PhaseThe algorithm was first proposed by Chandrakasan et al. It is adaptable to the clustering topology algorithm and has the characteristics of low power consumption and periodicity [28]. The idea of this algorithm is to organize nodes into clusters, and each cluster has a cluster head. The other nodes are ordinary nodes; all ordinary nodes can only communicate with the cluster head node of their own cluster, and at the same time, it can collect a large amount of node data. After fusing the data, it is aggregated to a sink node.LEACH proposes the concept of \"round,\" which includes the following two stages.The specific algorithm of cluster head election is as follows: each node randomly generates a number in the [0, 1] interval; if the number is less than the preset thresholdT(m), the node will declare itself as the cluster head node.(5)Among them,pis the probability of becoming a cluster head in a node,ris the current number of rounds,rmod (1/p) refers to the number of selected cluster head nodes in this round, andGrefers to the collection of nodes that have not been selected in each cycle. Its probability can generally be represented byT(m), andT(m)will increase with the increase of the number of rounds; assuming that the node has been elected as the cluster head, the remaining rounds ofT(m)can be set to be equal to zero. In other words, for a node that has not yet been elected as a"
"byT(m), andT(m)will increase with the increase of the number of rounds; assuming that the node has been elected as the cluster head, the remaining rounds ofT(m)can be set to be equal to zero. In other words, for a node that has not yet been elected as a cluster head, it means that after the next round, it has a better chance of becoming a cluster head, and all nodes will eventually have the opportunity to be elected as a cluster head.4.4. Data Communication PhaseThe above analysis needs to involve a problem, how to judge the load capacity of the cluster head node. This calculation shows the introduction of the load evaluation function method:(6)Among them,Drepresents the distance between the node and the center of the cluster, andEresidentrepresents the remaining energy of the node;Floadhas a load thresholdFload0,t1,t2, which needs to be set in advance according to the actual situation. After calculating the loadFloadof the cluster head according to the formula,Fload<Fload0judges the load.Because the wireless sensor network is easily susceptible to external environment interference and other characteristics, due to the problem of instability, it means that the node has a low load capacity and has the characteristics of suddenness and short-lived [29-32]. Based on this, considering the need to avoid mistakes, it is assumed that when the node load od < oan, the number of errors is determined, and the final judgment result is less than the load capacity, the cluster head can be"
"and short-lived [29-32]. Based on this, considering the need to avoid mistakes, it is assumed that when the node load od < oan, the number of errors is determined, and the final judgment result is less than the load capacity, the cluster head can be ready to be abandoned.By comparing the capabilities, the cluster head is formed, which means that the cluster head point formed will have all the capability information of other nodes. Assuming that the load capacity of the cluster head node is too low, it is necessary to combine the information list to determine the replacement cluster. The first node, that is, the excellent node within the selection range. At the same time, in order to prevent the abovementioned problems of the newly selected cluster head node, that is, the problem of too low load capacity, it is necessary to evaluate the load capacity of the replacement cluster head, and this work needs to be carried out before it officially becomes a cluster node. Only by passing the test and verifying that the load capacity of the replacement cluster head meets the requirements, can it become a real cluster head. At this time, the original cluster head node needs to send the information of other nodes in the cluster in the form of a list to the new cluster head node, and the cluster continues to enter the stable data communication stage; otherwise, the original cluster structure needs to be explained first, that is recombination, that is, redetermining all nodes of the"
"the form of a list to the new cluster head node, and the cluster continues to enter the stable data communication stage; otherwise, the original cluster structure needs to be explained first, that is recombination, that is, redetermining all nodes of the cluster by random integers, and thus re-entering a new round of cluster establishment [25,26].5. Simulation Results and AnalysisThis paper sets the area of 100 M ∗ 100 M wireless sensor network model and distributes 100 nodes in the area, and these nodes are randomly generated. In order to make the results more realistic, the experiments in this paper were repeated 400 times. Finally, all the collected results are averaged to obtain the final data. After analysis and comparison, corresponding conclusions are drawn. The simulation parameters are set as given in Table1.Table  1.Setting of simulation parameters.Parameter nameSet parameter valueNumber of nodes100Area size of the wireless sensor network100 M ∗ 100 MPower consumption of transmission amplifier10 Pj/bit/m2Packet size200 BData processing energy consumption5 nj/bitEnergy consumption of sending and receiving data50 nj/bitThe simulation scene of this paper is in a square area with base station coordinates (50, 175), the size of the area is 100 M ∗ 100 M, 100 nodes are randomly distributed, and the initial energy of each node is 2 J.5.1.

"size of the area is 100 M ∗ 100 M, 100 nodes are randomly distributed, and the initial energy of each node is 2 J.5.1. Cluster Head SelectionFirst, according to the process of cluster head selection, this paper uses Marble software to simulate the LEACH algorithm and the LHTCA algorithm. The simulation results are shown in Figure7.orepresents noncluster head ordinary node;∗represents the selected cluster head node. Figure7(a)is the cluster head selection diagram of the LEACH algorithm. We can see that its cluster head selection is unevenly distributed. In some areas, the distribution of cluster heads is concentrated, but there are no cluster heads in some areas and some common nodes. It is far away from the cluster head, and the result is that too much energy is consumed in the process of data transmission, and there are too many ordinary nodes in the area where the cluster head is located, which will lead to the accelerated death or failure of the cluster head node, which will eventually lead to network load distribution, seriously out of balance. Figure7(b)shows the cluster head selection process of the LHTCA algorithm. By comparing the above two sets of figures, we can see that the cluster head distribution of the LHTCA algorithm is more balanced, the probability of node death or failure is greatly reduced, and the network load is balanced. Sex is naturally high.Figure 7(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointCluster head election process of LEACH and LHTCA algorithms. (a)"

LifecycleFrom Figure8, we find that whenatakes different values, the life cycle of the LHTCA algorithm is much higher than that of the LEACH algorithm.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointLife cycle comparison chart.5.3. Energy Consumed by the NetworkFrom Figure9, we can see that in the first 25 seconds of network operation, the network energy consumption of the three algorithms is not very different, but from 25 seconds to 300 seconds, the curve changes between the LHTCA algorithm and the LEACH algorithm and the HEED algorithm. It tends to be more stable, and the network energy consumption of the LHTCA algorithm is much smaller than that of the other two algorithms. The resource utilization of the network system is improved, which indicates that the LHTCA algorithm has higher performance.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointTotal energy consumption of WSN.Through comparative analysis, it can be seen that the improved LHTCA algorithm has many advantages, such"

Performance Management TestingPerformance management is embodied in statistics and collection of performance management information, such as information related to sending and receiving data, delay, packet loss rate, and so on. At the same time, considering the actual situation of statistics, that is, it takes time, so it is usually necessary to design a certain time interval, and this article is suitable for 5 minutes. Through design, statistical analysis of all node performance information of network nodes is performed. Figure10shows the packet loss rate of a specific node.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointHistogram of node packet loss rate collected.The statistical calculation results show that the average private contract rate of 20 nodes reaches 26.9%, of which the highest and lowest are 44% and 13%, respectively.

In addition, it is found through the graph that the node 20 is closest to the gateway, which fully shows that the node delay is related to the gateway distance.6.

"AbstractWhen studying intelligent community and property management system, network service has an important impact on intelligent community construction and property management service. How to use machine learning and other technologies to improve the network service of intelligent community and integrate it into real estate property management is worthy of further research. This paper introduces the basic model of machine learning and proposes a network data prediction model based on time series. For the time dimension, an improved prediction algorithm model of machine learning is proposed. For mobile data allocation, from the perspective of ensuring the current and future continuity of the spectrum after spectrum allocation, this paper proposes a spectrum allocation algorithm based on the joint measurement of time domain and frequency domain. In addition, the VP-tree algorithm is used to construct the spatial vector relationship of the intelligent community. At the same time, in the time trend and periodicity of the mobile data in the intelligent community network, the attention mechanism is introduced to realize the distribution of mobile data and traffic prediction in the intelligent community by machine learning.

"This paper analyzes the requirements of the property management system, designs the property management information system including the field subsystem layer, data acquisition layer, and cloud service layer, introduces the property management module and customer service module in detail, and carries out the system test. The test results show that the system runs well. Finally, aiming at the problems existing in the property management industry, this paper puts forward the development strategy of property management.1. IntroductionThe rapid development of economy in the new era has led to the rise of intelligent communities. Intelligent communities use Internet of things and other technologies to meet people's convenience and intelligent needs for the living environment. For example, in aspects closely related to people, such as broadband mobile data and property management, they have become an important part of the development of intelligent communities [1,2]. The distribution and setting of community mobile data directly affect people's sense of network use. At present, many researchers have carried out experimental research on the mobile data distribution technology of intelligent community [3]. Property management can reflect the service characteristics of urban communities and is also an important part of improving residents' well-being. Real estate property management can not only promote the real estate industry, but also further improve urban community services [4]."
"the service characteristics of urban communities and is also an important part of improving residents' well-being. Real estate property management can not only promote the real estate industry, but also further improve urban community services [4]. While continuously improving the service quality, it can expand from the field of life services to the field of culture and economy. With the continuous renewal of China's real estate economic system, in order to adapt to the market reform and the needs of consumers, real estate property management also presents diversified and industrialized development. However, the current property management enterprises have some problems, such as low service quality, nonstandard workflow, few service projects, and low professionalism of personnel. Therefore, the property management enterprises are small, unable to form large-scale development and poor enterprise benefits. The problems existing in real estate property management not only affect the rights and interests of consumers, but also hinder the development of real estate property management industry and intelligent community [5]. The improvement of consumers' awareness of rights protection and the reform of the real estate industry have gradually exposed the problems of the property management industry to the public. Therefore, the real estate property management industry is in urgent need of reform and development, and the development of intelligent community is also facing a new test"
"gradually exposed the problems of the property management industry to the public. Therefore, the real estate property management industry is in urgent need of reform and development, and the development of intelligent community is also facing a new test [6,7]. Based on the development needs of intelligent community, this paper studies the data distribution of community mobile network, puts forward the distribution data model and evaluation criteria, designs the intelligent community property management system, analyzes the problems existing in the current real estate property management industry, and puts forward the development strategy of intelligent community property management industry, so as to lay a theoretical foundation for the development of intelligent community and property management.2. Related WorkThe explosive growth of data and the improvement of computer technology have promoted the continuous development of intelligent community. Among them, the distribution of community network data and the prediction of traffic have become the focus of research. More and more researchers apply machine learning technology to mobile data distribution and traffic prediction. The literature proposes that the neural network prediction model has higher self-learning and adaptability compared with the traditional data statistics methods, and can adapt to the changing characteristics of large-scale data at any time [8].

"prediction model has higher self-learning and adaptability compared with the traditional data statistics methods, and can adapt to the changing characteristics of large-scale data at any time [8]. Neural network is more practical in the field of traffic prediction, especially in the field of cyclic traffic prediction [9]. Therefore, more and more network traffic prediction methods use neural network. In the field of actual mobile network traffic, in addition to using the time dimension for research, it can also be predicted in the spatial dimension. According to the literature, according to the current characteristics of mobile network base station construction, if only the time characteristics are predicted, there are limitations [10]. Using the spatial sequence characteristics to predict the traffic can better meet the needs of mobile data base station design and planning. At the same time, it can further improve the intelligence of mobile data distribution. The literature proposes to predict and distribute community mobile network data based on machine learning method and spatio-temporal feature analysis [11]. The literature believes that although the time series and spatial series feature prediction models have been widely used, there are still some limitations [12]. It is more scientific to combine the two models to predict the traffic data. In terms of intelligent community property management, the literature believes that property management is an extended industry of"
"used, there are still some limitations [12]. It is more scientific to combine the two models to predict the traffic data. In terms of intelligent community property management, the literature believes that property management is an extended industry of real estate development and sales, and has gradually developed into a tertiary industry with independence and service. Property refers to the real estate industry. It is the management object of property management. The owner or consumer is the service object of property management. The service content includes management, operation, and business. Property management is a paid service activity. Literature holds that property management refers to the management and service of the living environment by consumers through authorization and entrustment and through the relevant management mode or technology adopted by a third-party professional organization or organization [13]. According to the literature, property management is to manage the safety, environmental greening, road maintenance, and sanitary cleaning around consumers, and provide certain services to owners or consumers according to the contents of the contract. It is a service for the whole life cycle of buildings, from the early stage to the middle stage, and from the design and maintenance of buildings to the whole life cycle of buildings. The literature puts forward that property management belongs to organized and regular business activities [14]. The operating"
"from the early stage to the middle stage, and from the design and maintenance of buildings to the whole life cycle of buildings. The literature puts forward that property management belongs to organized and regular business activities [14]. The operating company achieves the purpose of making profits by creating a service value, selling the value to customers, and maintaining the long-term service relationship between property companies and consumers. With the continuous development of market economy and information technology, the marketing means of property management has shifted from offline to online [15]. At the same time, providing network services is also a new direction of property management development. Network service is the integration of traditional property management and emerging information technology, and has become an important service content of property management in intelligent community.3.

The formula is as follows:(3)The classical time series decomposition method based on moving average is realized by using additive model or multiplicative model on the premise that the periodic factors of time series are roughly consistent in each decomposition cycle. Among them, the concept of m-order moving average is used, that is,(4)Sequence decomposition algorithm based on additive model: assuming that the time series isy(t), the additive model of the sequence is expressed as follows:(5)S(t) represents the periodic component of the sequence,t(t) represents the trend term of the sequence,R(t) represents the residual part after sequence decomposition, and the remaining residual is(6)Sequence decomposition algorithm based on multiplicative model: assuming that the sequence isy(t), the additive model is as follows:(7)S(t) represents the periodic component of the time series,T(t) represents the trend term of the time series,R(t) represents the residual part of the time series after decomposition, and the remaining residual is(8)For the decomposed time series, the trend and periodicity of the original time series can be analyzed by adopting specific formulas.

"series can be analyzed by adopting specific formulas. The time series decomposition algorithm of additive model has the following definitions:(9)3.2. Community Mobile Data Distribution AlgorithmFor the mobile network data allocation of the intelligent community, the location where the service can be allocated can be found through the candidate spectrum block, and then the time-domain fragment generated by the current service allocation can be calculated according to the remaining duration of adjacent services. The time fragment measurement formula is as follows:(10)The above formula is used to evaluate the impact of allocating services at the link on the original link in the future frequency domain. If the service is divided in a position that just meets the required number of frequency slots, the service has two adjacent services. At this time, only the TFM with the adjacent service with the longest remaining duration is calculated. The specific situation of TFM can be shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of spectrum allocation considering time dimension.In order to explore the carrying capacity of the link, define the spectrum continuity of the link:(11)Spectrum continuity change measurement SCVM definition:(12)This paper introduces a time-frequency domain joint measurement index of link:(13)Under the condition that the existing spectrum resource occupation information remains unchanged, the service allocation at the end of the link will affect"
"definition:(12)This paper introduces a time-frequency domain joint measurement index of link:(13)Under the condition that the existing spectrum resource occupation information remains unchanged, the service allocation at the end of the link will affect the future carrying capacity of the link to a certain extent, which is specifically reflected in the formation of new spectrum fragments in the future due to the difference of duration, which will affect the future continuity of the link. Therefore, the service should be allocated where the duration is less than that of adjacent services as far as possible, and the continuity of the original link should be affected as little as possible. Therefore, the smaller the TSCM value, the smaller the impact of service allocation on the current link, and the more reasonable the allocation scheme. Generally, spectrum allocation is performed on pathPcontaining multiple links, so the time-frequency domain joint measurement index of pathPis(14)3.3. Prediction Analysis and SimulationThe method proposed in this paper constructs the spatial combination by looking for the adjacent cells within m meters of the target cell. VP-tree is a binary tree structure that measures the space based on the distance information.

"distance information. It mainly uses the distance information between the commanding point and the target point to divide the space. For the calculation of the distance between cells, the longitude and latitude information of the cell can be used. Since the Earth is a spherical surface, the calculation of longitude and latitude should also be considered on a spherical surface, which can be calculated by haversine formula:(15)After forming a cell spatial binary tree by constructing VP-tree, you can quickly find several cells within a specified distance next to any target cell. In fact, the attention mechanism is to add an attention layer after the encoder to calculate the similarity between each expected input of the encoder and each time point of the encoder, to obtain an attention matrix. In the decoding process of the encoder, the predicted output of each time point corresponds to different context variables, so it will reflect a better trend, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointAttention mechanism.The processing of each vector at the encoder and decoder layer is as follows:Encoder:(16)Decoder:(17)The traffic prediction of intelligent community will produce different information sequences due to its own time and space factors, which are closely related, and working days, rest days, or weather factors may affect the prediction of mobile data traffic sequences.

"the operation and management ability can we improve the overall competitiveness of the company. In addition, property companies also need to standardize human management, financial management, and other aspects, further improve personnel management and organizational planning ability, form the company's organizational advantages, and build the company's brand value.The system can help enterprises expand their business scale. Only if they have high abilities in investment analysis and business expansion, and have the ability to analyze and learn market analysis and dynamic research, they can help managers improve the company's business planning ability and further expand the company's business scale.The system has a high level of information technology operation and management. At present, computer technology, Internet of things, and other technologies are developing rapidly. In terms of intelligent community construction and property management, a variety of emerging information technologies need to be used to meet various needs of consumers, especially network services. At the same time, the system also needs to meet the remote communication of multiple offline management institutions, realize real-time communication, give play to the effect of face-to-face communication, and improve the company's cross-regional management ability.4.2.

"the property service can be realized, the problems between property companies, real estate companies, and residents can be handled, and the relationship between consumers and companies can be maintained. At the same time, it can help property management companies realize standardized property management and further improve consumers' sense of happiness and experience.4.3.2. Customer Service ManagementThe service cycle of customer service management is longer, the complexity is higher, and higher professionalism is required. Generally, high-quality customer service can only obtain certain economic benefits after a long period of time, so the company needs a more standardized information system to help the company complete the content of customer service management. Now more and more companies pay attention to customer service management. The customer service management function designed by this system can help enterprises comprehensively and timely grasp the effect of customer service management, and can make reasonable planning and timely adjust the content of customer service management. This module designs a reminder mechanism and collaborative office mechanism, which can help managers obtain real-time customer information, timely understand customers' needs or problems reflected in property management, reply and deal with consumers' questions or suggestions, and establish a feedback mechanism to further improve consumers' trust in property management companies.4.4."

Research on Property Management Strategy of Intelligent Community5.1. Problems in Property Management5.1.1. Overall Service Level and Personnel Quality of the Industry Are LowPeople's living standards are getting higher and higher, and they need high-quality property services to meet people's growing cultural and living needs. However, at present, most property companies can only provide simple property services, which cannot meet people's demand for high-quality"
"higher and higher, and they need high-quality property services to meet people's growing cultural and living needs. However, at present, most property companies can only provide simple property services, which cannot meet people's demand for high-quality property services. The overall service level of the property management industry is low. Some property companies have not found their own positioning, but still believe that property managers are managers rather than service providers, and have no service awareness, nonstandard management, and poor service quality, and there are problems of arbitrary charges. In addition, the property industry belongs to the service industry. The salary income of employees is low, the working hours are high, and the rest time is short. Some posts even need 24-hour operation. Moreover, the society has a certain prejudice against the property service industry, resulting in the relatively low quality of employees in the industry, which is difficult to retain and attract high-level and high-quality talents.5.1.2. Mismatches between Property Management and Management of the Owners' CommitteeAt present, many communities or communities have not established owners' committees, or the owners' committees have formed interest alliances with property companies, resulting in that ordinary residents have no way to choose companies with better property services through democratic methods, resulting in nonstandard property management and inadequate property"
"have formed interest alliances with property companies, resulting in that ordinary residents have no way to choose companies with better property services through democratic methods, resulting in nonstandard property management and inadequate property services. There are more and more contradictions and disputes between property companies and residents, and owners are unwilling to pay property fees, resulting in worse property service levels. Form a vicious circle.5.1.3. Difficult Administrative SupervisionAt present, the administrative department for property management is understaffed and the administrative force is weak, but the supervision task is large, and there are some contradictions. Moreover, most administrative personnel are busy with daily affairs, the regulatory role is not obvious, and the administrative guidance is not in place. In the actual supervision work, the punishment of illegal enterprises is not high, and there is a problem of single management means. Some property companies infringe on the interests of residents, and the administrative departments do not take the initiative to punish the property companies, or there is no basis for relevant laws and regulations. Some of the contradictions between the property company and the owner are that the performance of the contract is not in place, and some are illegal buildings. However, the administrative department has not formed a joint force in property management and supervision, so it is unable to"
"the property company and the owner are that the performance of the contract is not in place, and some are illegal buildings. However, the administrative department has not formed a joint force in property management and supervision, so it is unable to properly solve the contradictions between the property company and the owner.5.1.4. Unpaid Property Fees Affect the Service Management LevelDue to a variety of reasons, most communities are in arrears of property management fees. At present, the government departments have issued guidance standards and rules and regulations related to property services, but in practice, residents may be dissatisfied with the health work of the property company, parking lot management, advertising and investment promotion of public parts, and other problems, and take this as a reason or excuse not to pay the property management fee. There are some residential areas due to the historical problems left over by the developers, the unfinished infrastructure construction, or property right certificate handling of the residential area, and the inadequate supporting equipment will also become the reasons for the owners to owe the property management fee. The property company has no source of income. The owners' arrears of property fees will directly affect the service level and service quality of the property company, and even affect the normal life of residents in serious cases.5.1.5. Owner Has Weak Awareness of Public and Autonomous ManagementAs"
"The owners' arrears of property fees will directly affect the service level and service quality of the property company, and even affect the normal life of residents in serious cases.5.1.5. Owner Has Weak Awareness of Public and Autonomous ManagementAs Party A of property management, the owner has the right to supervise the property management and the obligation to perform the contract. Many owners do not actively participate in the construction of the owners' committee, lack the awareness of active participation, and do not perform the contract signed with the property company, which is prone to disputes with the property company. In addition, some owners have bad behavior habits and their personal quality needs to be improved, such as taking out garbage at will, occupying public passages, parking at random, building in violation of regulations, and damaging house structures. The owner's personal behavior will directly affect the normal development of property services. The owner's civilization and compliance with public regulations will directly affect the service level of the property company.5.2. Property Management Strategy Selection5.2.1. Improve the system and Establish Property Management Laws and RegulationsFirst, we should improve the property service bidding management system and use market rules to regulate and restrict the behavior of property companies. Clarify the content of the property service contract, specify the main responsibilities, rights, obligations,"
"should improve the property service bidding management system and use market rules to regulate and restrict the behavior of property companies. Clarify the content of the property service contract, specify the main responsibilities, rights, obligations, and liabilities for breach of contract of the enterprise and the owner, further refine the property service level, and clarify the work content, service standard, and charging standard for each level of property service.Second, we should establish and improve the legal system of property management. Relevant government departments should establish the archives of property management companies, establish the service quality evaluation system of property management companies, regularly assess the property companies, file the service quality of property companies, carry out standardized management of property management companies, and take the owner's satisfaction as an important reference for the bidding of property management companies.Third, we should establish and improve the property complaint mechanism, clarify the supervision contents, investigate and deal with the nonstandard behaviors of property companies in time, and effectively protect the rights and interests of households and consumers. Property management should clarify the charging scope and charging standard, and the property management company should regularly announce the use of property management fees, such as building repair, road maintenance, public"
"of households and consumers. Property management should clarify the charging scope and charging standard, and the property management company should regularly announce the use of property management fees, such as building repair, road maintenance, public facilities maintenance, security work, cleaning work, and greening maintenance.Fourth, we should improve the punishment mechanism of property companies and implement blacklist management. For those with poor service quality of property companies and more complaints from owners, the property management contract can be terminated in accordance with the regulations, and the satisfaction evaluation results of residents can be directly linked to the property management expenses, so as to further restrict the behavior of property management companies. Government departments should strengthen the investigation and punishment of property companies with poor service quality and cancel the qualification of companies with nonstandard management.5.2.2. Strictly Manage and Guide the Healthy and Sustainable Development of Property Management EnterprisesOn the one hand, the top-level design of policies can help accelerate the development of the property service industry and further standardize industry standards, laws, and regulations. Government agencies can take various measures to cultivate more professional property management talents. Colleges and universities can set up property management-related majors to further do a good job in"
"industry standards, laws, and regulations. Government agencies can take various measures to cultivate more professional property management talents. Colleges and universities can set up property management-related majors to further do a good job in talent training. The property company can establish a school enterprise cooperation mode with colleges and universities. According to the needs of enterprises, the school can train professional talents suitable for the market demand by providing high-quality teaching. Government departments can also play a public welfare management function, set up job skills training related to property management, improve the quality of property practitioners, and carry out property service skills training in a planned and purposeful way every year. Through this targeted job training, the overall service level and professional level of the industry can be improved. Government departments can also set up a property service communication platform to promote learning and exchange between property companies. Property companies in different regions have accumulated a lot of property service experience in the process of practice. Government departments can help companies establish communication bridges, realize experience sharing and resource sharing, and promote the healthy development of the property industry. At the same time, we should guide all companies to establish brand service awareness, pay attention to brand construction and company image,"
"realize experience sharing and resource sharing, and promote the healthy development of the property industry. At the same time, we should guide all companies to establish brand service awareness, pay attention to brand construction and company image, create professional company brands, and promote benign competition among companies.On the other hand, property companies should develop in the direction of specialization. Property companies need to investigate and analyze the owners, further understand the needs of the owners, and be able to provide different property services for different regions, different people, and different geographical locations. At the same time, we should actively listen to the opinions and suggestions of the owners, further sort out the problems existing in our own management, constantly improve innovation, improve service quality, meet the needs of the owners, broaden market channels, and explore potential services.5.2.3. Change the Concept and Expand the Depth and Breadth of Property Management ServicesAt present, most property services stay in the basic aspects of water and electricity maintenance, sanitation, and safety guarantee. These works cannot reflect the depth and breadth of property management, and cannot meet the needs of owners for high-quality property services.

"management, and cannot meet the needs of owners for high-quality property services. Therefore, property companies need to change the traditional management concept and further tap the potential value of property services. The owner's demand for property services is multi-level and all-round. In addition to the basic water, electricity, heating, and parking security, there are more cultural needs. Therefore, the property company can further explore the breadth of property services and expand new projects and services on the basis of traditional service contents. Property management companies need to make progress, update management mode, innovate working methods, develop in the direction of modernization, further provide high-quality services, refine property services, and make enterprises bigger and stronger.6.

"AbstractBusiness management is an important part of social service and governance. With the development of economy and technology, the pressure on enterprises to participate in the market competition is gradually increasing. Therefore, it is particularly important to establish an information-based business management system. However, there are still many problems in the process of informatization development of enterprise business management, which seriously restricts the comprehensive development of enterprises. On the one hand, the existing business management information system lacks effective security and supervision links. On the other hand, there is a lack of professional information technology personnel within the enterprise. Machine learning is a discipline that specializes in how to simulate human learning behavior, and it can continuously learn new knowledge structures to make itself progress and develop. The development of enterprise business management informatization is consistent with the development direction of machine learning itself. Therefore, this paper proposes a business management informatization construction method based on a machine learning algorithm, which aims to further promote the development of enterprises in the direction of informatization and modernization and improve the informatization level of enterprises.

Experiments show that with the support of machine learning technology, the level of enterprise business management informatization can reach 82.31%, fully indicating that machine learning can help enterprises innovate management models and improve the level of information management of enterprises.1. IntroductionIn the era of rapid development of information technology, various emerging information technologies have begun to integrate with various industries. In this process, business management has taken the lead in realizing the integration with information technology because of its unique status and role. However, in the process of integration and development, business management informatization has encountered many problems. First of all, the system of business management informatization is not perfect. In the actual informatization construction, there is a lack of effective supervision within the business administration, which can easily lead to work mistakes and information leakage. Second, in the construction of business management informatization, talents are an important driving force for the development of the industry. But at present, there is a shortage of compound information technology talents. The vitality of industry development is insufficient.

"of the industry. But at present, there is a shortage of compound information technology talents. The vitality of industry development is insufficient. Finally, the informatization development of business management relies too much on information technology, which also brings hidden dangers to the development of the industry to a certain extent. Machine learning is a comprehensive discipline, so it can fit both the field of business administration and the field of information technology, providing assistance for the integration of the two. With the blessing of machine learning, the integration between business management and informatization construction will be closer, and enterprises can also keep pace with the times in the process of development and continuously improve their own management models and structures. The information construction method of modern enterprise business management information can not only effectively reduce the operation and management costs in the normal production and operation process of industry and commerce, but also effectively realize the dynamic enterprise business management.In the development of business management informatization, with the rapid development of technologies such as the Internet, business management plays an increasingly prominent role in corporate decision-making.

"business management plays an increasingly prominent role in corporate decision-making. Many scholars have also turned their attention to this. Starting from the concept of business management, Lazzarini briefly analyzed the methods to improve the level of business management informatization in enterprises. Then he pointed out the problems existing in the current development of enterprise business management informatization on the basis of actual cases [1]. Telli and Aydin pointed out that in the information age, the students of the business administration department and business education department of the university should prepare well in advance so that they can adapt to the development of the times and even become the vanguard of the times after graduation [2]. Sholikhi aimed to study the informatization level of business administration students. To this end, he used descriptive quantitative methods and used 33 questionnaires as research tools. He carried out a series of investigations and experiments with the second semester of UNISBA business administration students as the research objects [3]. Khosravi et al. pointed out that the performance appraisal of business administration has a great influence on the development of society and economy, so a perfect performance appraisal system should be established.

"of society and economy, so a perfect performance appraisal system should be established. Based on this, he linked artificial intelligence with convolutional neural networks and established a corresponding performance research model according to the actual situation [4]. The above experts and scholars analyzed the development of business management informatization from different perspectives and put forward many innovative viewpoints. However, they did not take into account the actual situation of the development of business management informatization, which was out of touch with reality.Machine learning is a comprehensive discipline that simulates human learning behavior. It can simulate real-world situations to the greatest extent and derive optimal solutions based on it. For this reason, this paper refers to a series of related literature. Zhang et al. proposed to use machine learning algorithms to predict the hourly solar irradiance, for which he designed a solar irradiance prediction model based on machine learning. At the same time, he also designed a comparative experimental model of solar irradiance prediction based on multi-layer feedforward neural network, support vector regression, fuzzy inference system, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to test the performance of the prediction model [5]. Sahoo et al. developed an ensemble modeling framework based on machine learning and uncertainty analysis specifically to predict changes in groundwater levels. In the"
"neuro-fuzzy inference system to test the performance of the prediction model [5]. Sahoo et al. developed an ensemble modeling framework based on machine learning and uncertainty analysis specifically to predict changes in groundwater levels. In the process, he selected an input dataset by using a combination of mutual information, genetic algorithms, and lag analysis, and then used the selected dataset in a multi-layer perceptron network architecture to simulate seasonal groundwater level changes [6]. Khosravi et al. used machine learning algorithms to predict wind speed data from the Osorio wind farm. In the process, he also utilized a multi-layer feedforward neural network to predict time-series wind speeds. In order to improve the accuracy of wind speed measurement, he specially trained a machine learning algorithm and added a time domain feature model to it [7]. Wahid et al. pointed out that machine learning can be used to identify and measure the electrical activity of skeletal muscle. He then performed the recognition test 10 to 12 times on 10 adult male subjects aged 20-37, and in the process, he extracted four basic temporal features [8]. The above experts and scholars have analyzed the application of machine learning from different perspectives, but they have not studied the application of machine learning in the information construction of business administration.After a series of experimental analysis, it can be known that SVM and BPNN have significant advantages"
"from different perspectives, but they have not studied the application of machine learning in the information construction of business administration.After a series of experimental analysis, it can be known that SVM and BPNN have significant advantages in dealing with fraud and impersonation attacks and routing attacks, and the detection and defense capabilities can basically reach 90%. However, its effect in dealing with DOS attacks is not ideal. The level of detection and defense is only 80%. In contrast, machine learning can guarantee a detection rate of more than 85% when dealing with the above attacks. It can also maintain a certain degree of alertness under Dos attacks, the detection time of which is only 3.5 seconds. The performance of talent training based on machine learning can reach 89.1% in terms of information technology capabilities and 92.3% in terms of responsibility. Its comprehensive capacity reaches 93.3%. This fully shows that the talent training model of machine learning can cultivate a large number of qualified informatization talents for enterprises and promote the informatization level of business management of enterprises.2.

"and Information DevelopmentInformatization is an emerging productivity, which is mainly represented by intelligent tools. Among these intelligent tools, computers are one of the most widely used and common tools at present [9]. When tools and the human brain combine and collide, the tools can bring the corresponding productivity to the society. The productivity generated in this collision process is a typical product of information technology, so it is called information productivity, which can benefit the society once it is well used [10]. The three major technologies have been polished over time, enabling the rapid development of enterprise informatization. At the same time, it provides a great guarantee and technical support for the enterprise, so that the sub-brands of the enterprise can slowly achieve sustainable development, thereby further improving its competitiveness in the market. Meanwhile, informatization has an irreplaceable role in promoting economic development. It can change the traditional management mode of enterprises and effectively control and manage various processes of enterprises.The construction of information technology is never-ending, so it attracts many capable people to explore it. Under the joint research of many experts and scholars, people have finally reached a series of consensus about informatization [11]. First, the process of using and exploring information technology is actually the basis of information technology construction [12]."
"joint research of many experts and scholars, people have finally reached a series of consensus about informatization [11]. First, the process of using and exploring information technology is actually the basis of information technology construction [12]. Second, the core of informatization construction is to improve the efficiency of information resources utilization and reduce unnecessary information energy consumption. Finally, the construction of information technology cannot be separated from the support and backing of the real industry, so all the epitaxial products are important cornerstones of the construction of information technology. During the practice of informatization construction, informatization is gradually extracted from people and new concepts of informatization are derived. At the same time, these concepts of informatization collide with each other and continuously form the six main elements. At the same time, these elements can be summarized as: information network, information resources, information technology, information industry, information regulatory environment, and information talents. One of the six elements of the information technology relationship diagram is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointBusiness administration was originally a management and economic discipline, but with the progress of the economy and the times, the discipline of business administration is slowly being given more contemporary requirements.

"viewerPowerPointBusiness administration was originally a management and economic discipline, but with the progress of the economy and the times, the discipline of business administration is slowly being given more contemporary requirements. Moreover, with the advent of the information age, business administration practitioners and experts can only better see the dynamic status quo faced by enterprises in society by constantly keeping up with the times, continuously promoting the construction of information technology, and improving the information management level of enterprises and even society. In the context of the era of business administration informatization, only by continuously deepening the reform of business administration informatization can enterprises stand on the tide in the process of development, constantly discover the problems in management and give solutions, and then promote the overall development of enterprises [13]. In addition, with the further development of business administration informatization, the employment and information costs of enterprises will be significantly reduced, further reducing the operating costs of enterprises and increasing the actual benefits and competitiveness of enterprises in the market, which also establishes confidence for enterprises to carry out a new round of informatization construction.

"due to the effects of many internal and external factors [15]. First of all, the capital investment in the information construction of business management is insufficient. In the process of informatization construction, enterprises often need to invest a lot of capital, technology, and manpower, but this also hinders the current development of enterprises to a certain extent, so informatization construction often faces a dilemma [16]. On the one hand, enterprises hope to develop informatization and realize the upgrading of management capabilities. On the other hand, enterprises are reluctant to invest a lot of money and resources in informatization construction, because the process of informatization construction is often long and the time limit for enterprises to obtain benefits from it is also relatively long. In addition, because the enterprise is the first to carry out information construction, so the construction process is often inexperienced. At the same time, without scientific guidance, it is impossible to convince the board of directors to invest solely on the experience of enterprise managers, which further confirms the problem of shortage of funds. In the process of construction, the company also lacks professional information technology talents, and cannot provide assistance for its subsequent informatization construction.

Finally, there are functional deficiencies in the business management informatization system established by the enterprise, so the information service of the enterprise cannot be guaranteed at all. One of the basic elements for the healthy and rapid development of informatization in the business administration department is to have a set of correct and scientific informatization development plans. The current business management information system structure established by the enterprise is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the information system structure of business management, the business management information system mainly includes the basic information architecture, computer security, information services, information management, and information technology [17]. In this structure, the business management information system can cooperate with other parts to exchange and communicate information. Meanwhile, it can also minimize the waste of resources. However, the system lacks an obvious supervision and security system, which cannot provide a guarantee for the informatization construction of enterprises.2.2.

"of enterprises.2.2. Machine LearningMachine learning is a comprehensive discipline that studies human learning and behavior. Machine learning is at the heart of the field of big data and artificial intelligence, and it is one of the main ways to achieve intelligence [18]. Machine learning focuses on how to simulate human behavior through computers. In other words, machine learning can obtain the optimal solution set that meets the problem through continuous training and prediction, which can further improve the accuracy of the prediction and judgment process [19]. Machine learning involves several research fields, which mainly include linear algebra, probability theory, information theory, algorithm theory, and numerical computation [20]. It is a relatively crosscutting discipline. It is because it covers several disciplines and fields, so its application scope is also very wide, among which the basic application areas of machine learning are shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the development of informatization, network security is one of the most common and influential problems. But in the eyes of machine learning, like general problems, can be solved by continuous training and prediction.

"network failure will not bring a fatal blow to the informatization construction of the enterprise, the occurrence of the network failure will hinder the process of the informatization construction of the business management of the enterprise to a certain extent. Network failure is a branch of network security problems, so this article will take this as an example to analyze the general idea of machine learning in dealing with informatization problems [21]. Among them, the machine learning network fault diagnosis process is shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the process of diagnosing network faults, the data need to be obtained first to discover the general manifestations of network faults. Then countermeasures can be found according to the symptoms. Next, on the basis of the problem, feature extraction is performed on the data, and then a preprocessing model is built to lay the foundation for machine learning. At the end, what to do is to use machine learning to train, analyze, and output results.With the deepening of the development of informatization, the relationship between informatization construction and the network is getting closer and closer. Therefore, to ensure the smooth progress of informatization construction, the security of network links must be ensured. On the basis of ensuring network security, the integration of business management and informatization can also be further promoted. Machine models can effectively predict and capture network"
"construction, the security of network links must be ensured. On the basis of ensuring network security, the integration of business management and informatization can also be further promoted.

At this time, according to the classification principle, it can be known that the samples located in category A on the left side of the midline will be wrongly assigned to category B.

The schematic diagram of the misclassification is shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointTherefore, in order to solve this problem, the data need to be processed before training so that it obeys a uniform distribution. Assuming that the data are randomly given, the homogenization process of the data is as formulas (6) and (7):(6)(7)Among them,g(x) represents the probability distribution function, which obeys the quadratic distribution.Prepresents the degree of homogenization of the data, and its value ranges from 0 to 1. If its value is closer to 1, it means that the distribution of the data is more uniform; otherwise, it means that the distribution of the data is not uniform. In order to solve for coefficientωand offset b of the data, it needs to be differentiated.(8)(9)(10)Among them,h(x) represents the function after derivation, andJ(ω,b) represents the gradient descent function, which can realize iterative updates of parameters.

Its geometric meaning can be expressed as follows:(16)It can be seen from formula (16) that the geometric meaning of the sample data represents the distance between the sample point and the plane. In this process, the parameters of the data samples can be obtained and used to determine the relationship between multiple targets, so as to achieve multi-target classification.Then, after collecting certain data and information, network security problems can be detected and checked to prevent network intrusion or other network failures.(17)(18)In formulas (17) and (18),Trepresents the path in the network and Δtrepresents the information increment on the path.

"according to the above optimal matching parameters, a network security detection model can be initially formed.(19)(20)In formulas (19) and (20), (C,σ) represents the detection parameters, andPrepresents the correct rate of detection. In this process, the network guarantee of information services has been basically established. The comprehensive management of network security has also been strengthened. Also based on the above concept, the method can further be expanded to make it protect the business administration information construction.2.3. Countermeasures for the Development of Business Management Informatization under the Background of Machine LearningIn the process of development and construction of business administration information technology, it is found that there are many problems in it. Based on this, the above machine learning algorithm is used to improve the construction of business administration informatization, aiming to propose effective countermeasures for the above problems [22]. First, machine learning can simulate human learning to the greatest extent, so it can be used to train information technology talents to continuously meet the business administration information construction of enterprises. At the same time, if enterprises want to occupy a place in the fierce market competition, then they should constantly strengthen the technical training of practitioners and vigorously build a systematic information management structure to achieve the"
"At the same time, if enterprises want to occupy a place in the fierce market competition, then they should constantly strengthen the technical training of practitioners and vigorously build a systematic information management structure to achieve the improvement in the efficiency of the use of information equipment, improve the function of information systems, and ensure the efficient operation of all information management work in enterprises. In this process, the emergence of information technology talents can also accelerate the pace of upgrading the management structure of enterprises, which in turn will further promote the training of talents.Second, based on the theory and practice related to machine learning, enterprises can continuously improve the construction of business administration information technology networks [23]. In the actual development process, network security issues and network failure problems are important factors that restrict the development of information technology in enterprises. Therefore, based on machine learning enterprises can detect and predict the network problems that appear in the information technology construction in a timely manner in order to guarantee the security of the enterprise business administration information technology construction. In other words, only by building a safe and scientific business management information platform can an enterprise further improve the quality and level of the business management process, and"
"business administration information technology construction. In other words, only by building a safe and scientific business management information platform can an enterprise further improve the quality and level of the business management process, and ultimately ensure the information security of the enterprise. In addition, enterprises can also strengthen the supervision within the information technology construction through the established business administration information technology network [24]. The combination of the informatization department and the business administration department can, to a certain extent, promote enterprises to carry out modernization as well as improve the modern supervision system [25]. For example, when relevant enterprises build or upgrade their own information technology network systems, they should also simultaneously improve and upgrade the public area network effectively, and continuously optimize the content of the information technology management platform to provide better help for business administration and related supervision work. Finally, although the business administration informatization system previously established by the enterprise can collaborate with other departments and industries for information interaction, the structure of its established business administration informatization system has functional deficiencies.

"and industries for information interaction, the structure of its established business administration informatization system has functional deficiencies. Therefore, in order to improve the structure of information technology construction and avoid a series of security risks, a machine learning-based information technology security and supervision system are re-established, as shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the previous business management informatization architecture, there is a lack of an effective supervision system within the informatization construction, so a machine learning-based security and supervision system is added. In this system, the acquisition of information resources and the distribution of resources must pass the verification of the security assurance module to ensure the security of information. At the same time, in this system, it is also interfaced with information management standards with a view to realizing real-time updates and maintaining the innovative nature of information construction in business administration. On this basis, the establishment of information security and supervision system can further promote the upgrading of the social information management system.3.

"Construction of Business Management under the Background of Machine LearningThe construction of enterprise informatization is inseparable from the network. Therefore, to maintain the achievements of enterprise informatization construction, the security of the enterprise network should be ensured first. Maintaining network security requires enterprises to start with basic network fault maintenance. The basic network fault detection of different models is shown in Table2.2.Basic network fault detection of different models.ModelsDetection rateFalse detection rateCBC0.8920.762GCM0.9120.695HNN0.9260.744Ours0.9520.885The problem of a network failure will directly affect the information construction process of business management. Table2shows that the HNN model has a good effect in the process of basic network fault detection, and its detection accuracy basically reaches 92.6%. But at the same time, it is also found that its false detection rate also ranked first, reaching 15.6%. In contrast, the network assurance model based on machine learning has a detection rate of 95.2% for basic network failures, and its false detection rate is also relatively low, only 11.5%. This shows that the guarantee model based on machine learning can promote the informatization construction of business administration and guarantee the informatization process of business administration.After the network security issues are guaranteed, enterprises can carry out business management informatization"
"can promote the informatization construction of business administration and guarantee the informatization process of business administration.After the network security issues are guaranteed, enterprises can carry out business management informatization construction without any worries. In this process, different methods create different values for enterprises. Among them, the early results of business management informatization construction are shown in Table3.3.Early achievements of business management informatization construction.AlgorithmManagement efficiencyOperating efficiencyInformation levelOriginal0.6120.63146.78Improved0.6230.65852.92HNN0.7210.77266.68Table3shows that in the early stage of business management informatization construction, the management efficiency of enterprises was relatively low, only 61.2%, and the informatization level of enterprises was only 46.78%. Therefore, in this process, enterprises have adopted many ways to carry out informatization construction. Among them, the informatization construction of business management based on HNN has improved the informatization degree and management efficiency of enterprise business management to a certain extent, reaching 66.68% and 72.1%, respectively.However, with the emergence of the wave of informatization construction, more and more enterprises have begun to explore new methods of informatization construction of business management.

"with the emergence of the wave of informatization construction, more and more enterprises have begun to explore new methods of informatization construction of business management. Under the background of this era, enterprises must vigorously develop informatization if they want to achieve their own development. Among them, the information construction of business management based on machine learning is shown in Table4.4.Informatization construction of business management based on machine learning.ProjectsInfrastructureEquipmentSecurityConvenienceSVM56.2359.6561.5662.55HNN61.3662.6369.6271.22Ours66.5463.9676.9879.68Logistic63.5962.1168.6568.29Table4shows that during the construction of information infrastructure, the degree of informatization based on machine learning has reached 63.59%, far exceeding other methods. Among them, in the process of information security construction, the information security level based on HNN reached 69.62%, and the security level based on LOGISTIC reached 68.65%. In contrast, the information security level based on machine learning reaches 76.98%, far exceeding the other three methods.

"in the construction of informatization infrastructure and in the degree of informatization security.The development of informatization ultimately depends on the cultivation of information technology talents, so this paper aims to explore the cultivation of talents in the construction of enterprise business management informatization. For this reason, this article comprehensively considers the personnel's information technology ability, sense of responsibility, comprehensive coordination ability and comprehensive quality, and hoping to cultivate qualified information talents for enterprises. Among them, the training of business management informatization talents based on machine learning is shown in Table5.5.Training of business management informatization talents based on machine learning.QualityInformation technologyResponsibilityCoordinationComprehensive abilityMachine learning8.919.239.129.33Neural networks8.268.658.929.02Logistic8.358.928.628.90Table5shows that the performance of talent training based on machine learning can reach 89.1% in information technology ability, 92.3% in responsibility level, and 93.3% in comprehensive ability.

"large number of qualified informatization talents for enterprises and promote the informatization level of business management of enterprises.4. Results of the Construction of Business Management InformatizationIn the process of promoting the construction of business management informatization, it can be found that there are differences in the degree of informatization in different regions, which affects the informatization process of the business management industry to a certain extent. In order to further narrow the informatization difference between regions, different algorithms are used to simulate the informatization level of different regions. The informatization construction based on machine learning can comprehensively improve the informatization level of regional business management and promote the coordinated development of the region. The regional differences in the level of business management informatization are shown in Figure7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure7shows that the level of business management informatization in different regions tends to be different. Among them, the level of informatization in economically developed areas is relatively high, reaching 74.99%. The level of informatization in economically underdeveloped areas is low, reaching only 49.65%. This fully shows that the construction of business management informatization based on machine learning can promote the coordinated development of regions and narrow regional differences.In the"
"underdeveloped areas is low, reaching only 49.65%. This fully shows that the construction of business management informatization based on machine learning can promote the coordinated development of regions and narrow regional differences.In the construction of informatization, the cultivation of information technology talents is the top priority. In this process, enterprises often adopt different methods to cultivate talents, but the effects of different methods are not the same. Among them, the information technology personnel training under different algorithms is shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure8shows that HNN, machine learning, and SVM algorithms can promote the cultivation of information technology talents and contribute to the construction of enterprise business management informatization. But under the same time, the number of information technology talents trained by machine learning algorithms reached 80, while the number of talents trained based on the neural network was 60. The number of people based on SVM was 70. This shows that the advantages of machine learning algorithms are obvious in the efficiency of talent training.However, the process of enterprise business management informatization construction is often not smooth, and many problems are often encountered.

"construction is often not smooth, and many problems are often encountered. Network security is a major challenge in the process of informatization construction. In order to ensure the security of informatization construction and ensure enterprise information security, this paper proposes a security assurance and supervision system based on machine learning. Among them, the network security guarantee in the context of machine learning is shown in Figure9.Open in figure viewerPowerPointNetwork intrusion is the core of the network security problem. Figure9shows that SVM and BPNN have significant advantages in dealing with fraud and impersonation attacks and routing attacks, and the detection and defense capabilities can basically reach 90%. But their effect in dealing with DOS attacks is not ideal, the level of detection and defense of which is only 80%. In contrast, machine learning can guarantee a detection rate of more than 85% when dealing with the above attacks. It can also maintain a certain degree of alertness under Dos attacks, and the detection time is only 3.5 seconds.In order to further explore the effect of machine learning on the improvement of the level of business management informatization, the article compares the level of business management informatization of the same enterprise in different periods.

The informatization degree of business management based on machine learning is shown in Figure10.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure10shows that in the early stage of informatization construction of business management, the level of informatization construction of enterprises is not high, which is only 60%. With the support of machine learning technology, the informatization level of business management of enterprises has been significantly improved. In particular, in the middle stage of development, the level of business management informatization based on machine learning reaches 70.53%, while the level of business management informatization based on other methods is the highest at 64.84%. In addition, in the later stage of business management informatization construction, the level of business management informatization based on machine learning reaches 82.31%. This fully shows that machine learning can promote the improvement of the informatization of business management of enterprises, which can help enterprises achieve better and faster development.5.

"important position in both enterprises and society. For this reason, it is necessary to continuously carry out informatization construction to meet the needs of the ever-developing era. Starting from the informatization of business management, the article first analyzes the concept of informatization and a series of problems existing in the construction of informatization. Then, the article introduces business administration and analyzes the advantages of combining business administration with informatization. Second, starting from the concept of machine learning, the article focuses on analyzing the utility of machine learning in promoting the integration of business management and informatization. At the same time, the article also puts forward relevant countermeasures to promote the development of business management informatization from the perspective of machine learning. However, due to time reasons, the article does not expand the informatization to other fields or realize the analogy. In the future, the article will start from the bottom layer of information technology and continue to explore the new trend of information development.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.Open ResearchData AvailabilityNo data were used to support this study.References1Lazzarini S.

"AbstractDeveloping countries have commonly adopted financial management information systems developed by prominent international organizations or developed countries to modernize their fiscal functions. However, these systems face limitations in effectively meeting the specific needs of recipient countries and maintaining their built-in functionalities. This field report aims to investigate the module based adoption of South Korea's Integrated Financial Management Information System as a customized strategy that aligns with the demands and capacities of recipient countries. The implications of this report provide practical pathways to integrate the push for modernization efforts of donor countries and the pull for localization goals of recipient countries, improving the effectiveness of financial management systems in developing countries and promoting self-sufficiency and adaptability.1 INTRODUCTIONThe Korean government's financial management information system has undergone several generations of development. The immediate previous version in its third generation is called the Digital Budget and Accounting System (DBAS), also known as dBrain, which stands for \"digital Brain\" to manage the comprehensive public finance system in the digital era. The launch of dBrain in 2007 seeks to revamp the national financial management system with the objectives of strengthening budget credibility and integrating several fiscal information systems, including the first and second"
"system in the digital era. The launch of dBrain in 2007 seeks to revamp the national financial management system with the objectives of strengthening budget credibility and integrating several fiscal information systems, including the first and second generations of fiscal management systems. The implementation of the dBrain system has aligned with the Korean central government's vision of improving efficiency, transparency, and citizen participation (Jeong & Oh,2019). This alignment is attained by employing a new fiscal management framework that focuses on the development of national financial operation plans, the adoption of top-down budgeting, and the implementation of performance management. By integrating these approaches, the dBrain system facilitates streamlined financial management practices. The latest version of the fourth generation, called dBrain plus, enables policy analysis using artificial intelligence functions in the DBAS framework. This advanced version was officially launched in January 2022.Building upon the successful experiences of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in effectively operating and consolidating of national fiscal management, the Korean government has planned to expand the implementation of these financial management systems to developing countries through official development assistance projects. Moreover, recognizing the advantages offered by the fourth generation financial management systems, the Korean"
"to expand the implementation of these financial management systems to developing countries through official development assistance projects. Moreover, recognizing the advantages offered by the fourth generation financial management systems, the Korean government is confident that the dBrain system can serve as an appropriate system for managing capital flows in recipient countries.However, despite the Korean government's successful track in establishing and implementing IFMIS, caution should be warranted when considering an export plan of the dBrain system to recipient countries. The predefined target goals set by the Korean government may not effectively translate into improving financial management performance of recipient countries due to the lack of localized strategies that align with their unique needs and capacities for managing the dBrain system. To overcome these challenges, the purpose of this field report is to provide tailored strategies that are necessary to facilitate a successful transition to the appropriate adoption of the dBrain system in developing countries. This approach is expected to ensure the effective incorporation of their requirements and promote improved financial management capacities.Recent studies (e.g., Grossi et al.,2023; Hopper et al.,2017) have demonstrated that the existing literature has primarily focused on the development discourses of public sector accounting systems promoted by international organizations and dominantly reviewed"
"studies (e.g., Grossi et al.,2023; Hopper et al.,2017) have demonstrated that the existing literature has primarily focused on the development discourses of public sector accounting systems promoted by international organizations and dominantly reviewed these systems designed by English-speaking countries and Europe over the past decades. In most cases, international organizations such as the World Bank have received significant scholarly attention, particularly in the context of the adoption of public sector accounting technologies by emerging economies. However, Grossi et al. (2023) argue that government accounting systems framed by market-driven principles do not guarantee their successful implementation in emerging economies. In this scholarly landscape, this field study underscores the need to shift the focus to state-driven financial systems, as exemplified by the Korean government financial information system when recipient countries consider adopting financial information systems from developed countries rather than market-driven approaches provided by international organizations.2 THE EVOLVING FISCAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM LANDSCAPE IN SOUTH KOREASouth Korea has made notable changes in its public finance systems following the implementation of the Treasury Act in 1951 and the Budget and Accounts Act in 1961.

"the implementation of the Treasury Act in 1951 and the Budget and Accounts Act in 1961. Over time, driven by economic growth and the introduction of international standards in public financial management, particularly in response to financial aid received from international organizations, the Korean government has been committed to modernizing its financial systems and creating its own financial management information system. In an effort to make public finances more efficient and accountable, the Korean government's financial management systems have been progressing through three generations of development.The first generation of the Korean central government's financial management system was implemented in 1999 and comprises two distinct operating systems. The first system, SALIMI, was an accounting management system managed by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The second system, Fiscal Information Management System (FIMSys), served as a budget management system managed by the Ministry of Strategic Planning and Finance. In 2003, SALIMI was renamed as the National Finance Information System (NaFIS), representing an upgraded version of its predecessor. While SALIMI facilitated a simple fiscal system that executed integrated settlements of cash-based standards, NaFIS adopted a more specific approach to execute integrated settlements of accrual standards (Jeong,2017). The introduction of accrual accounting in NaFIS enabled the provision of capital assets and long-term"
"settlements of cash-based standards, NaFIS adopted a more specific approach to execute integrated settlements of accrual standards (Jeong,2017). The introduction of accrual accounting in NaFIS enabled the provision of capital assets and long-term solvency, effectively addressing the limitations of cash-based systems in tracking expenditure efficiency (Chan,2003). In the context of government accounting reforms, countries working with international organizations to develop their public financial management systems have been encouraged to adopt an accrual basis accounting (Torres,2004). Building on the findings of Martí and Kasperskaya (2015), the incorporation of accrual accounting standards in the finances of the Korean central governments has been beneficial in improving internal and external transparency, leading to improved decision-making processes in resource allocation.The second-generation fiscal management system maintained the FIMSys system while introducing additional budget tools. These tools include the budget information requisition/management business server, the internal information management server, and the system management server. In the case of NaFIS, it consists of a standard finance code information server, a finance electronic bill presentation and payment transmission server, electronic funds transfer servers, financial organization transfer servers, and an integrated settlement server.Before the mid-2000s, there existed a fragmented financial"
"server, a finance electronic bill presentation and payment transmission server, electronic funds transfer servers, financial organization transfer servers, and an integrated settlement server.Before the mid-2000s, there existed a fragmented financial structure, where multiple financial information systems operated independently, impeding the effective sharing of needed information at the national level. This setup not only constrained the Korean central government's ability to promptly respond to the rapidly changing internal and external environments but also presented challenges in systematically sharing financial information among different agencies. Several pressing needs emerged that necessitated the development of an improved financial management system. These needs reflected the growth in the scale of public finance, the shift in fiscal management paradigm focusing on performance-based approaches, increased participation of civil organizations, the transition from a divisional item budget system to a divisional program budget system, alignment with international standards in financial regulations, and integration of finance information systems (Bae et al.,2013).In line with these needs and the international trends of establishing IFMISs, the Korean government also introduced the third generation fiscal management system, known as DBAS, in April 2004, which became fully operational in January 2007. Considering the well-acknowledged success factors of integrating"
