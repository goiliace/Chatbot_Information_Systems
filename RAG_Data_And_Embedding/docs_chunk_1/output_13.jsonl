The latter realises the correct positioning of the BIM data in the system software by establishing the corresponding relationship between the coordinate value of the Revit model measurement point and the coordinate value of the actual measurement point, and realises the unification of the spatial datum of the two.The specific process of unifying spatial coordinate reference of model data is as follows:(1)Set the spatial coordinate system adopted by the system software, and get the actual measurement reference point coordinates of the comprehensive pipe gallery.(2)Obtain the actual geographical coordinates and attitude of the entity object of the comprehensive pipe gallery model in the 3D GIS scene, and then construct the coordinate transformation matrix of pipe gallery model.(3)Import the BIM data of the comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects with local coordinate system into the 3D GIS scene with consistent coordinate system by translating, rotating, and scaling the BIM model with the coordinate transformation matrix.It was found that due to the large amount of geometric data of the sub-component model after BIM model transformation, it took a long time for all models to carry out coordinate transformation.

"was found that due to the large amount of geometric data of the sub-component model after BIM model transformation, it took a long time for all models to carry out coordinate transformation. First of all, the offset of the centre point coordinate of the comprehensive pipe gallery model (BIM) data to the centre coordinate of the model in the 3D geographic environment of the system software, as well as the rotation and scaling amount of the model were stored in the newly created POS file. Then, when importing the BIM data into the 3D GIS scene, the position of the original model is transformed by the POS file information, so as to realise the coordinate matching and seamless integration of the BIM data in the 3D GIS scene.When all the model data of multiple comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects (or several stages and sections of one project) have been unified into the same coordinate system by using the same coordinate transformation method, the spatial position and rotation posture of BIM data in the 3D GIS scene were better consistent with the real situation, and the relative spatial position relationship between adjacent BIM data were ensured to be correct. The error caused by coordinate transformation can be ignored.4.3.2 Development of data exchanging tool for modelTo import the BIM data into the 3D GIS scene, it needs to convert the data of comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects from BIM format to the data format supported by the 3D GIS platform.

"Development of data exchanging tool for modelTo import the BIM data into the 3D GIS scene, it needs to convert the data of comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects from BIM format to the data format supported by the 3D GIS platform. The FBX File format is a popular 3D file format, which is often used by many data exchanging tools for BIM data. Most 3DGIS software supports the import and export of FBX format files.In this research, a comprehensive pipe gallery BIM data export tool plug-in is developed. The tool can export the BIM data file to FBX format data file by calling the data interface in Revit software. The logic structure and operation flow chart of the BIM data export tool plug-in is shown in Figure5. The content filtering and content renaming dialog window of the tool plug-in is shown in Figure6.

The technical flow chart of releasing these data is shown in Figure9.FIGURE 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointImplementation process of releasing comprehensive pipe gallery model data.Researchers developed the self-developed wizard function and realised the basic framework of high cohesion and low coupling through plug-in. Without losing the accuracy of structure, texture and attributes of the model data, the model data of the comprehensive pipe gallery projects can be converted to the general format of the system, to be compiled and be released. The breakpoint release function has been realised, which effectively solved the problem that the data release process may be interrupted due to unexpected events such as sudden power failure. The performance and efficiency of this tool have been optimised and solved the also solved the problems of low efficiency and poor user experience when releasing large amounts of data.5 DEVELOPING DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM5.1 Research on data fusion technology of multi-source spatial dataIn this research, there are many differences in multi-source spatial data, such"

The technical route of multi-source spatial data fusion is shown in Figure10.FIGURE 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointTechnical route of multi-source spatial data fusion.The fusion of multi-source spatial data needs to unify different data sources in a dynamic way. It consists of two steps. First, the fusion of non-spatial data is realised, and then the fusion of non-spatial data and spatial data is realised. The data fusion mainly goes through the following steps: unifying file format of the data, identifying the same entity and link related entities with relevant information, identifying data conflicts and coordinating the conflict data, tracing the origin of data, entity identification, and conflict resolution process and tracking the evolution of data.5.2 Research on data fusion management"

The system software has realised the comprehensive management of BIM and GIS data, realised 3D visual display of BIM data of comprehensive pipe gallery projects in the 3D GIS environment. When the comprehensive pipe gallery model data are released, the system software can load the released model data and integrate them in the scene of the urban three-dimensional geographical environment, query these pipe gallery model data in 3D visualisation.In this research, the data of comprehensive pipe gallery model are all from the comprehensive pipe gallery construction project. And the data of comprehensive pipe gallery model in the system software are organised and managed according to construction projects and different stages of the project, such as planning declaration stage, planning approval stage and completion verification stage etc. The data of each stage of each comprehensive pipe gallery project can be selected and loaded in the system software.

And several functions such as plan approval of the design scheme of the project, collaborative management and comparative analyse of multiple schemes of the same project are developed. The 3D visual display of the comprehensive pipe gallery project is shown in Figure11.FIGURE 11Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3D visual display of the comprehensive pipe gallery project.5.3 Research on integrated management technology of 3D spatial dataIn this research, the management of three-dimensional urban full space data is realised, including the big data of the whole process of pipeline (include pipe gallery) project, such as the survey data of underground pipe network, pipe network planning data, pipe network planning approval data and pipe network completion verification data. At the same time, the system software can further integrate urban basic geographic data, 3D engineering geological data, hydrogeological data and land subsidence monitoring data. Finally, users of the system software can view all the above-ground and underground data, two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial data of the urban in an all-round way, view the design scheme data and surrounding terrain image data of the comprehensive pipe gallery project at different stages and versions, and realise the integrated management and"

At the same time, multiple stage nodes such as project approval data, project planning approval data, and project planning verification data are connected under the project name node. Nodes with different version numbers are connected under each stage node, which corresponds to the data of the project, the stage, and the version. Thus, all data of the project can be easily accessed in the system, and the planning and full-cycle management of the project can be realised.5.5 Research on efficient massive spatial data management technologyIt is one of the key tasks to implement efficient massive spatial data management and improve the data access performance of the system software.

"Research on efficient massive spatial data management technologyIt is one of the key tasks to implement efficient massive spatial data management and improve the data access performance of the system software. The researchers have integrated the real-time occlusion data clipping algorithm, the LOD model of quadtree structure and the data dynamic loading technology to quickly display the massive 3D data. And the researchers have optimised and innovated the data processing and loading process and algorithm, simulated the natural observation mode of human to express the 3D urban model with rich geometric details and photo texture. It enables users to obtain visual experience and spatial perception that are close to the real world.5.5.1 Research on data dynamic loading technologyThe researchers adopted algorithms based on data layering, blocking and dynamic updating of data pages to realise multi-level and large-scale urban scenes real-time rendering. In order to reduce the \"delay\" of data display, the multi-thread operation mechanism is used to make full use of the CPU resources of the computers. During the horizontal roaming and the vertical level of detail transition, the data to be updated is read from the hard disk into the memory ahead of time according to the direction trend of the viewpoint movement, then the actual data update is realised in the memory, as shown in Figure12.FIGURE 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointEstablishment of dynamic data page based on block"

Firstly, a simple visibility test is carried out by using several occlusion objects (which are selected according to the prior knowledge of viewpoint movement, for example, buildings near the street can be used as occlusion objects when walking along the street) to identify whether some areas of the scene (spatial convex shell range, i.e. bounding box of hierarchical structure) are completely or partially occluded. Secondly, preprocessing is performed for large-scale occlusion recognition near all instantaneous viewpoints. Finally, a hierarchical visibility test is repeated to ensure that as few dynamic occlusion target arrays as possible and close to the viewpoints are processed, as shown in Figure13.FIGURE 13Open in figure viewerPowerPointData clipping of perspective display.5.5.3 Research on multi-resolution LOD technology based on quadtree structureThe LOD simplification method based on visual correlation is to reasonably select the multi-resolution map representation according to the position and direction of the viewpoint."
"Research on multi-resolution LOD technology based on quadtree structureThe LOD simplification method based on visual correlation is to reasonably select the multi-resolution map representation according to the position and direction of the viewpoint. The terrain around the viewpoint is represented by the level of high detail, and the area far from the viewpoint is represented by the level of rough detail.The multi-resolution LOD technology based on the quadtree structure is realised by dividing the quadtree. The terrain is divided into many blocks of different sizes. The closer the distance is, the larger the block is, and the farther the distance is, the smaller the block is. These square blocks of different sizes are rendered in the system software to realise different LOD levels rendering, and effectively simplify the complexity of the 3D scene. In this research, this method is used to improve the performance of displaying urban 3D model. The specific processing flow chart is shown in Figure14.FIGURE 14Open in figure viewerPowerPointMulti-resolution LOD technology based on quadtree structure.First, the original map data is processed to generate intermediate data. In this process, the projection parameters and processing level need to be set. In this step, the data will be resampled and the pyramid will be built as the viewpoint moves.

Secondly, the intermediate data is processed, including calling and setting background data for fusion. Finally, the processed intermediate data will be packaged which the system can directly load.6 APPLICATION CASEIn the application case of Beijing, the researchers collected a large amount of spatial data in the region, including basic geographic data, three-dimensional urban current data, urban overall planning results data, urban regulatory detailed planning results data, project design scheme data, project construction scheme data, project completion verification data, three-dimensional geological data, settlement monitoring data etc. Among these data, there are BIM data files of several comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects. A series of processing have been done on these data, unifying spatial coordinate reference system, light weighting the data in BIM format and importing the BIM data into the 3D GIS scene, creating 3D Models of comprehensive pipe gallery, releasing the comprehensive pipe gallery model data. The researchers further fused and integrated these data into a unified software system, and used a data resource directory tree control in the system to organise and manage these data uniformly.

The three-dimensional visualisation of the data of the integrated pipe gallery in the area where the case is located is shown in Figure16, The cross section of the comprehensive pipe gallery is shown in Figure17.FIGURE 15Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe integration and display of urban aboveground and underground data.FIGURE 16Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe three-dimensional visualisation of the data of the integrated pipe gallery.FIGURE 17Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe cross section of the comprehensive pipe gallery.The system software has well realised the function of batch creating urban three-dimensional underground pipe network model from two-dimensional underground pipeline data and the BIM data of comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects, and realised the functions of data loading, three-dimensional data browsing of urban ground and underground full data, creating new project, querying project data, locating the project scope on the map, calculating project planning index, verifying project planning index etc. Through the system, users"

It provides a good technical support service for the safety analysis and disaster prevention planning decision application of urban comprehensive pipe network system.7 CONCLUSIONThe integration and application of data is one of the core contents of the construction of information management system. The creation of 3D visualisation model of integrated pipe gallery model (BIM) data and its integration in GIS platform is the focus of this research, especially to solve the integration and fusion of multi-source data of different scales.In this research on data integration and application technology of urban comprehensive pipe gallery based on 3D GIS platform, the researchers have well solved the integration and application of BIM and GIS data based on 3D GIS platform and applied to the system software named 3D intelligent system for full-cycle management and approval analysis of urban comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects.

"to show their compliance with CAP-Ecoschemes, organic certification or private sustainability schemes in the supply chain by handing in relevant data to government agencies and certification bodies. This trend will strengthen with Europe's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive's requirement that large retailers and food processors report their scope-3 sustainability (which includes emissions of their inputs), the Sustainable Finance Act and a trend to a more performance-oriented CAP. Farms that contribute to the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) also have to provide more data with its broadening to a Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN). To reduce administrative burdens, we posit that smart reporting is needed to meet all these demands. This will require innovation in the farm office and we offer a clear pathway for implementation of such innovations.Some of the checks on a farm's performance can be done by monitoring from the outside, e.g. by remote sensing or earth observation systems. But even though satellite data have become more and more detailed, not everything is observable from space. Data on key performance indicators, like the use of pesticides and antibiotics, or material balances for energy and nitrate, need data from the ground. This is also the case for product mass balances that are obligatory in the certification of organic farms.

Preferably such data are already available in the farm office for farm management purposes (Vrolijket al.,2017).In designing systems for the farm office that can deliver the required sustainability data, three important design criteria have to be taken into account: (1) minimise the administrative burden, (2) create systems and indicators that can also be used in farm management, and (3) guarantee a certain level of auditability. The first is important as farmers' time is precious and paperwork is seldom a favourite pastime (Reissiget al.,2022). Using indicators that play a role in farm decision-making is important to help reduce the administrative burden but also to help incentivise the farmer to act on the sustainability information in his management. Auditability becomes more important when the sustainability performance is linked to government payments or higher product prices. An exceptional case of fraud can discredit an entire system that is based on self-reporting.In this paper, partly based on the European MEF4CAP (Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks for the CAP) project, we propose a way forward for innovation in the farm office to enable smart reporting to produce the required sustainability indicators - and what governments can do to foster it.Filling in formsAn obvious first step for collecting monitoring data is to ask farmers"
"a way forward for innovation in the farm office to enable smart reporting to produce the required sustainability indicators - and what governments can do to foster it.Filling in formsAn obvious first step for collecting monitoring data is to ask farmers to fill in a paper form or provide farms with a form on a website and have the data entered by the farmer using his mobile phone or computer. Online applications for the CAP payments or the registration of animal movements are examples in use that illustrate how governments build their compliance systems. As a next step a digital Farm (Field) Book can be provided by the government in which the farmer records each application of a pesticide including quantity, timing and crop or even the field.Such a solution is a nice start, but an administrative burden. Farms that use a Farm Management Information System (FMIS) would appreciate the option to upload the required data directly from their software. This reduces double manual data entry and the chance of mistakes (criterion 1). The administrative burden can also be an incentive for farmers to start using a (commercial) FMIS. This satisfies design criterion 2, to integrate sustainability indicators in farm planning and farm decision-making.

"FMIS are developing into central farm management tools for precision agriculture by integrating data flows from satellites and machinery. Precision farming technologies demand data (e.g. prescription maps to generate instructions for spraying machinery), and the machines and robots also generate large amounts of data at a detailed geographical scale (Poppeet al.,2023). An integration between web forms and FMIS helps farmers to follow a technological pathway, in which administrative burdens are decreasing (the y-axis in Figure1) and management is supported with more data (the x-axis in Figure1) with the introduction of new digital solutions.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointInnovation options and design criteriaA Spanish demonstration case in the MEF4CAP project (https://mef4cap.eu/) illustrated this way forward by a public-private development of systems that help farmers to upload data from FMIS including data from tractors. A Dutch demonstration case showed how data on environmental emissions (e.g. ammonia, CO2, fine particles) could be collected from on-farm sensors and added to an FMIS or farm accounting system. However, there is still work to do to distinguish individual farm emissions from the ambient levels, and such sensors are not cheap.Robotic accountingThe reporting of sustainability data from an FMIS does not lead to extra manual input at the reporting phase, but much data still needs to be manually entered in the FMIS itself.

"and such sensors are not cheap.Robotic accountingThe reporting of sustainability data from an FMIS does not lead to extra manual input at the reporting phase, but much data still needs to be manually entered in the FMIS itself. This solution also faces limitations for design criterion 3 as the data are not auditable - it is easy to 'forget' to enter the buying or spraying of a pesticide. The solution to the challenge of manual data entry can be tackled by digitising invoices and delivery notes, that are currently often on paper or at best in pdf format. These are not computer-readable and force the farmer to type the data into web forms or the FMIS. Farmers or the accountant then also need to enter the data in the Farm Financial Accounting (FFA) software for their VAT application and on the website of their bank to conduct the payment.Accounting offices are experimenting with scanning software to read invoices on paper or pdf, but for the moment this is sub-optimal. Some accounting offices send the hard to read invoices to low-income countries for manual data entry. Furthermore, scanning works for the total amount of an invoice, but details on the individual items (i.e. quantity, quality, unit price) are discarded in the process.

"Introducing fully digital invoices and delivery notes would solve this; software could take up such messages as easily as a meeting request in a mailbox, and process it with robotic algorithms for inclusion in FMIS and FFA (and make an instruction to a bank to pay). Although technically not too difficult as standards already exist, this asks for a coordinated effort in a food chain where all companies join such a move towards digital invoices in a relatively short time span (Poppeet al.,2022). The European E-invoicing directive could speed up the transition as several Member States require the use of digital invoices in business-to-business transactions in the coming years. As most invoices are made by larger input suppliers and (on farm sales) by food processors, it makes sense to include agriculture in such an obligation.Integrate FMIS and FFACompliance monitoring with web forms or an FMIS is based on self-reporting and is not easily auditable. The solution to this problem can be found in FFA. Or more precisely: in an interaction and cross-check between FMIS and FFA. Although the two systems share a history in accounting, they drifted apart in the last century, first in their paper form and then also in their computerised form.

"form. Accounting was mainly tax accounting and often went to special advisors who deal with tax, financial management and estate planning. FMIS stayed on the farm or with a technical advisory service.If a farm purchases an input that is potentially environmentally damaging (e.g. a pesticide), this should in principle be recorded in FMIS. At the same time, this purchase should also be recorded in FFA in order to claim VAT and to subtract the cost in the income statement. In this way, FFA can be used as a cross-check on FMIS. Of course, farmers could decide not to report the purchase in either system, but in that case the farm is essentially imposing on itself a tax equal to the VAT rate that is not claimed. The consistency between the two systems can thus be checked in an audit (Breembroeket al.,1996).From the viewpoint of administrative burden, it would be even more attractive if there was only a single system. In large companies Enterprise Resource Packages (ERP systems, like SAP) fulfil this role of a combined FMIS and FFA. Farmers do not need all the functionality of such a complex system (with functionality for buying, inventory and sales processes). However, a light version that integrates FMIS with FFA and repairs the historic separation, would be welcome to reduce the administrative burden and improve the quality and auditability of self-reported sustainability data.

"historic separation, would be welcome to reduce the administrative burden and improve the quality and auditability of self-reported sustainability data. For example, it might be possible to add a module to the FMIS that handles invoices and delivery notes for a VAT application and is integrated with banking software (Poppeet al.,2021,2023).Central databasesThere are also examples, especially in the dairy sector, where existing central databases with animal registrations and milk recordings are extended with digital data from input suppliers like feed companies and veterinarians. This seems attractive from the point of view of lessening the administrative burden in the short run, although farmers still have to enter data in their FMIS, digital banking software and FFA. More importantly, it does not satisfy the design criteria on management support (criterion 2) and auditability (criterion 3) as much as an integration of FMIS and FFA. In such cases farmers have to provide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant authorisations to the companies to transfer the data to a central database. The data transfer is typically done only a few times a year, which makes it more difficult to use the data in operational farm management. Data from some input suppliers might not be provided - especially a risk when products are bought across the border by internet sales or because the border is close.

"Data from some input suppliers might not be provided - especially a risk when products are bought across the border by internet sales or because the border is close. Some farmers are also wary of approaches involving large databases as they fear less autonomy and too much government control of their data.Policy implicationsPolicymakers who argue for more performance-oriented policies and food companies that become responsible for the sustainability of their inputs have an interest in data-intensive relationships with farmers (Ehlerset al.,2021,2022). For governments a number of points deserve attention:Information requests should be digital and should allow uploading of data from commercial software (FMIS and FFA).Digitalisation of invoices and delivery notes would reduce the administrative burden, but does and will require a collective approach. Precedents exist: for example, governments often require their own suppliers to provide digital invoices and banks are obliged to provide banking data in digital format.The European Commission is upgrading the FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) to FSDN (Farm Sustainability Data Network), to include a broader set of sustainability indicators. Indicators used by the government and those used by food processors and retailers on the same sustainability theme should not differ in their definition as the data have to come from the same source in the farm office.

"those used by food processors and retailers on the same sustainability theme should not differ in their definition as the data have to come from the same source in the farm office. Algorithms to calculate sustainability indicators can be standardised and be provided as open source to software companies. Innovative solutions can be built in collaboration with commercial FMIS or FFA software providers and advisory services. Once data are available in FSDN, benchmarks can be published to be used by farmers, advisors, banks and others to increase the sustainability of farming.In a performance-oriented CAP, the provision of data on sustainability indicators does not have to be a bottleneck if innovation in the farm office is taken seriously. Again, there are precedents for making data provision mandatory, e.g. the introduction of the VAT system and the requirement of farm accounting introduced in the 1970s for farms that applied for interest subsidies under the CAP. Very small farms (with an annual turnover of less than € 25,000 for example) could be exempted (Poppe,2023).A trust issue might arise where some farmers are reluctant to supply data. Governments, therefore, should make clear that it is better to have policies based on data on environmental performance than stronger policy instruments like the maximum number of animals per hectare, or a total ban on a chemical input.

"on data on environmental performance than stronger policy instruments like the maximum number of animals per hectare, or a total ban on a chemical input. Using an arbitrarily high default value, in the case where a farm-level specific indicator is not supplied, might convince farmers to overcome their doubts. A trusted party, e.g. a certification body, as in organic farming, between farmers and the big brother government can be a solution: such an organisation only has to transfer the end result (certified yes/no) to the government or a food chain company. It is equally important to create IT systems in which data are under control of farmers in a digital wallet and are exchanged only with authorisations.In some smaller sectors and specific languages, some collective or public action to create smart reporting software may be needed; currently a market solution with good competition between IT companies and their software packages / services is not guaranteed.Support for innovation in the farm office to enable smart reporting is important and must be an important point of attention in programs for precision farming, digitalisation and sustainability management.

"to show their compliance with CAP-Ecoschemes, organic certification or private sustainability schemes in the supply chain by handing in relevant data to government agencies and certification bodies. This trend will strengthen with Europe's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive's requirement that large retailers and food processors report their scope-3 sustainability (which includes emissions of their inputs), the Sustainable Finance Act and a trend to a more performance-oriented CAP. Farms that contribute to the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) also have to provide more data with its broadening to a Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN). To reduce administrative burdens, we posit that smart reporting is needed to meet all these demands. This will require innovation in the farm office and we offer a clear pathway for implementation of such innovations.Some of the checks on a farm's performance can be done by monitoring from the outside, e.g. by remote sensing or earth observation systems. But even though satellite data have become more and more detailed, not everything is observable from space. Data on key performance indicators, like the use of pesticides and antibiotics, or material balances for energy and nitrate, need data from the ground.

Farmers do not need all the functionality of such a complex system (with functionality for buying, inventory and sales processes).

For example, it might be possible to add a module to the FMIS that handles invoices and delivery notes for a VAT application and is integrated with banking software (Poppeet al.,2021,2023).Central databasesThere are also examples, especially in the dairy sector, where existing central databases with animal registrations and milk recordings are extended with digital data from input suppliers like feed companies and veterinarians. This seems attractive from the point of view of lessening the administrative burden in the short run, although farmers still have to enter data in their FMIS, digital banking software and FFA. More importantly, it does not satisfy the design criteria on management support (criterion 2) and auditability (criterion 3) as much as an integration of FMIS and FFA. In such cases farmers have to provide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant authorisations to the companies to transfer the data to a central database. The data transfer is typically done only a few times a year, which makes it more difficult to use the data in operational farm management.

For governments a number of points deserve attention:Information requests should be digital and should allow uploading of data from commercial software (FMIS and FFA).Digitalisation of invoices and delivery notes would reduce the administrative burden, but does and will require a collective approach.

"to show their compliance with CAP-Ecoschemes, organic certification or private sustainability schemes in the supply chain by handing in relevant data to government agencies and certification bodies. This trend will strengthen with Europe's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive's requirement that large retailers and food processors report their scope-3 sustainability (which includes emissions of their inputs), the Sustainable Finance Act and a trend to a more performance-oriented CAP. Farms that contribute to the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) also have to provide more data with its broadening to a Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN). To reduce administrative burdens, we posit that smart reporting is needed to meet all these demands. This will require innovation in the farm office and we offer a clear pathway for implementation of such innovations.Some of the checks on a farm's performance can be done by monitoring from the outside, e.g. by remote sensing or earth observation systems. But even though satellite data have become more and more detailed, not everything is observable from space. Data on key performance indicators, like the use of pesticides and antibiotics, or material balances for energy and nitrate, need data from the ground. This is also the case for product mass balances that are obligatory in the certification of organic farms. Preferably such data are already available in the farm office for farm management purposes (Vrolijket al.,2017).In"
"need data from the ground. This is also the case for product mass balances that are obligatory in the certification of organic farms. Preferably such data are already available in the farm office for farm management purposes (Vrolijket al.,2017).In designing systems for the farm office that can deliver the required sustainability data, three important design criteria have to be taken into account: (1) minimise the administrative burden, (2) create systems and indicators that can also be used in farm management, and (3) guarantee a certain level of auditability. The first is important as farmers' time is precious and paperwork is seldom a favourite pastime (Reissiget al.,2022). Using indicators that play a role in farm decision-making is important to help reduce the administrative burden but also to help incentivise the farmer to act on the sustainability information in his management. Auditability becomes more important when the sustainability performance is linked to government payments or higher product prices. An exceptional case of fraud can discredit an entire system that is based on self-reporting.In this paper, partly based on the European MEF4CAP (Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks for the CAP) project, we propose a way forward for innovation in the farm office to enable smart reporting to produce the required sustainability indicators - and what governments can do to foster it.Filling in formsAn obvious first step for collecting monitoring data is to ask farmers"
"a way forward for innovation in the farm office to enable smart reporting to produce the required sustainability indicators - and what governments can do to foster it.Filling in formsAn obvious first step for collecting monitoring data is to ask farmers to fill in a paper form or provide farms with a form on a website and have the data entered by the farmer using his mobile phone or computer. Online applications for the CAP payments or the registration of animal movements are examples in use that illustrate how governments build their compliance systems. As a next step a digital Farm (Field) Book can be provided by the government in which the farmer records each application of a pesticide including quantity, timing and crop or even the field.Such a solution is a nice start, but an administrative burden. Farms that use a Farm Management Information System (FMIS) would appreciate the option to upload the required data directly from their software. This reduces double manual data entry and the chance of mistakes (criterion 1). The administrative burden can also be an incentive for farmers to start using a (commercial) FMIS. This satisfies design criterion 2, to integrate sustainability indicators in farm planning and farm decision-making. FMIS are developing into central farm management tools for precision agriculture by integrating data flows from satellites and machinery.

"FMIS are developing into central farm management tools for precision agriculture by integrating data flows from satellites and machinery. Precision farming technologies demand data (e.g. prescription maps to generate instructions for spraying machinery), and the machines and robots also generate large amounts of data at a detailed geographical scale (Poppeet al.,2023). An integration between web forms and FMIS helps farmers to follow a technological pathway, in which administrative burdens are decreasing (the y-axis in Figure1) and management is supported with more data (the x-axis in Figure1) with the introduction of new digital solutions.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointInnovation options and design criteriaA Spanish demonstration case in the MEF4CAP project (https://mef4cap.eu/) illustrated this way forward by a public-private development of systems that help farmers to upload data from FMIS including data from tractors. A Dutch demonstration case showed how data on environmental emissions (e.g. ammonia, CO2, fine particles) could be collected from on-farm sensors and added to an FMIS or farm accounting system. However, there is still work to do to distinguish individual farm emissions from the ambient levels, and such sensors are not cheap.Robotic accountingThe reporting of sustainability data from an FMIS does not lead to extra manual input at the reporting phase, but much data still needs to be manually entered in the FMIS itself. This solution also faces"
"and such sensors are not cheap.Robotic accountingThe reporting of sustainability data from an FMIS does not lead to extra manual input at the reporting phase, but much data still needs to be manually entered in the FMIS itself. This solution also faces limitations for design criterion 3 as the data are not auditable - it is easy to 'forget' to enter the buying or spraying of a pesticide. The solution to the challenge of manual data entry can be tackled by digitising invoices and delivery notes, that are currently often on paper or at best in pdf format. These are not computer-readable and force the farmer to type the data into web forms or the FMIS. Farmers or the accountant then also need to enter the data in the Farm Financial Accounting (FFA) software for their VAT application and on the website of their bank to conduct the payment.Accounting offices are experimenting with scanning software to read invoices on paper or pdf, but for the moment this is sub-optimal. Some accounting offices send the hard to read invoices to low-income countries for manual data entry. Furthermore, scanning works for the total amount of an invoice, but details on the individual items (i.e. quantity, quality, unit price) are discarded in the process. Introducing fully digital invoices and delivery notes would solve this; software could take up such messages as easily as a meeting request in a mailbox, and process it with robotic algorithms for inclusion in FMIS and FFA (and make an instruction"
"Introducing fully digital invoices and delivery notes would solve this; software could take up such messages as easily as a meeting request in a mailbox, and process it with robotic algorithms for inclusion in FMIS and FFA (and make an instruction to a bank to pay). Although technically not too difficult as standards already exist, this asks for a coordinated effort in a food chain where all companies join such a move towards digital invoices in a relatively short time span (Poppeet al.,2022). The European E-invoicing directive could speed up the transition as several Member States require the use of digital invoices in business-to-business transactions in the coming years. As most invoices are made by larger input suppliers and (on farm sales) by food processors, it makes sense to include agriculture in such an obligation.Integrate FMIS and FFACompliance monitoring with web forms or an FMIS is based on self-reporting and is not easily auditable. The solution to this problem can be found in FFA. Or more precisely: in an interaction and cross-check between FMIS and FFA. Although the two systems share a history in accounting, they drifted apart in the last century, first in their paper form and then also in their computerised form. Accounting was mainly tax accounting and often went to special advisors who deal with tax, financial management and estate planning. FMIS stayed on the farm or with a technical advisory service.If a farm purchases an input that is potentially"
"form. Accounting was mainly tax accounting and often went to special advisors who deal with tax, financial management and estate planning. FMIS stayed on the farm or with a technical advisory service.If a farm purchases an input that is potentially environmentally damaging (e.g. a pesticide), this should in principle be recorded in FMIS. At the same time, this purchase should also be recorded in FFA in order to claim VAT and to subtract the cost in the income statement. In this way, FFA can be used as a cross-check on FMIS. Of course, farmers could decide not to report the purchase in either system, but in that case the farm is essentially imposing on itself a tax equal to the VAT rate that is not claimed. The consistency between the two systems can thus be checked in an audit (Breembroeket al.,1996).From the viewpoint of administrative burden, it would be even more attractive if there was only a single system. In large companies Enterprise Resource Packages (ERP systems, like SAP) fulfil this role of a combined FMIS and FFA.

"AbstractWith the rapid development of network technology and database technology, computers have been able to store large-scale and massive data. On the other hand, traditional data analysis and processing tools such as management information system can only process these data on the surface, but the deeper data analysis ability is not satisfactory. The contradiction between data supply ability and data analysis ability is becoming more and more prominent, so there is an urgent need for an automation technology that can deeply process data. Data mining technology came into being. Cluster analysis, as an important topic in data mining, is a data mining method that divides data into natural groups and gives the description of the characteristics of each group. It is a basic method of data mining and knowledge discovery. Cluster analysis is a data mining technology for unsupervised classification of data without prior knowledge and guidance. Through the appropriate use of advanced algorithms, it can explore the hidden valuable information, improve the quality of data analysis and interpretation, and provide a scientific judgment basis for the reprocessing or understanding of data by other data analysis and sorting tools.

Then it expounds the principle of R-means clustering algorithm, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of basic R-means clustering algorithm, and expounds several existing improvement methods. An improved R-means clustering algorithm and a clustering analysis model based on R-means clustering algorithm are proposed, and the corresponding algorithm flow and implementation are given.1. IntroductionHuman society has entered a period of high-speed civilization. Especially since the 1990s, information technology and Internet technology, people have accumulated very rich data in various fields of production and life. These massive data not only promote the development of database technology but also make it easy for people to obtain a large amount of data. However, on the other hand, in the face of large-scale massive data, people are no longer satisfied with data query and processing. They urgently hope to further analyze these data, find out the correlation between the data, and put forward useful information to help people make decision analysis and scientific research. To meet these requirements, traditional database technology is obviously powerless.

"traditional database technology is obviously powerless. Therefore, people urgently need a technology and tool that can intelligently and automatically convert data into useful information and knowledge. In this way, data mining technology came into being and gradually became a research hot spot in the field of computer science, attracted many experts and scholars, and showed strong vitality. As an important subject in data mining technology, cluster analysis has attracted more and more attention of researchers in recent years. It is a data mining method that divides data into natural groups and gives the description of the characteristics of each group. It is a basic method of data mining and knowledge discovery. Measuring the effect of government activities in the public sector is a concept including multiple objectives. In the research at home and abroad, productivity, quantity, proportion, effect, and value are often used as indicators to measure performance [1-5].Data mining is a process of mining potential and useful information and knowledge from a large number of irregular and disordered data. It is also called data mining or data mining. It covers a wide range of fields, including artificial intelligence, statistical technology, database, and other related technical fields.

"technology, database, and other related technical fields. As a multidisciplinary field, the commonly used technologies of data mining include decision tree, association rules, neural network, cluster analysis, classification, prediction, visualization, and so on. Among them, cluster analysis (hereinafter referred to as \"clustering\") is one of the most widely used and mature data mining technologies. It is an effective technical method for people to explore and extract the internal relationship between things. Its main function is to divide the data set into several different groups according to certain rules so that the data objects in the same group are as similar as possible. The data objects in different groups are different as much as possible. The similarity between data objects is calculated by describing the attributes of objects. Different from classification, clustering is a typical unsupervised learning process, which does not need to know the object characteristics in advance, so it is widely used in the data preprocessing process. In addition, clustering has important applications in machine learning, spatial data analysis, pattern recognition, business decision-making, image processing, web document classification, and data compression [6-12].The research on clustering has lasted for decades, during which clustering algorithms emerge in endlessly.

"classification, and data compression [6-12].The research on clustering has lasted for decades, during which clustering algorithms emerge in endlessly. Generally speaking, the main basic clustering algorithms can be divided into the following categories: partition-based methods, hierarchy-based methods, density-based methods, grid-based methods, and model-based methods. K-means clustering algorithm is one of the most commonly used typical partition-based algorithms, which uses the sum of error square criterion function as the clustering criterion. It has the advantages of simple operation, fast, efficient, and scalable processing of large data sets, but the algorithm also has the following defects: the clustering results are sensitive to the selection of the initial center value, the K value in the algorithm needs to be specified in advance, it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution, and only spherical clusters can be found. So far, a large number of literatures have put forward many effective specific improvement measures for the above problems, but they all have some limitations. Therefore, it is still of great significance to continue to improve and improve the K-means clustering algorithm [13-16].For initialization sensitive issues, Kaufman et al. proposed a heuristic method to select the initial clustering center of K-means by estimating the density of data samples.

"sensitive issues, Kaufman et al. proposed a heuristic method to select the initial clustering center of K-means by estimating the density of data samples. Steinbach et al. proved that k-means algorithm has a good clustering effect, and the clustering time is linear with the number. Yao Minli and others regard the cluster center set as population particles, introduce GSA to search the initial cluster center with the best clustering quality, and propose an improved k-means clustering based on GSA algorithm. Duan Longzhen et al. proposed an improved density peak clustering algorithm combined with genetic K-means to solve the problem of cluster misclassification caused by manual selection of cluster center when processing multidensity peak data sets by density peak clustering algorithm [17]. In Zhang et al. [18], development of cognitive computing and three-way decision-making makes it possible to deeply understand sequential patterns through the temporal correlation analysis. The main challenge is to obtain concise models that express the rich semantics of multiple time-series (MTS) analysis. In Wu et al. [19], a new dynamic infinite hybrid model with self-definable step size is proposed to deduce the eeg fatigue signal dynamics.

"The instantaneous spectral features provided by integrated wavelet transform and Hilbert transform were extracted to form four fatigue indexes. Li et al. [20] proposed a spherical K-means clustering method. Its purpose is to divide a given point of unit length intoksets to minimize the intracluster sum of cosine dissimilarity. Sinaga and Yang [21] proposed a new unsupervisedK-means (U-K-means) clustering algorithm, which can automatically find the optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of U-K-means clustering algorithm is analyzed. It is compared with the existing U-K mean method. Lakshmi and Baskar [22] proposed a new initial centroid selection method ofK-means document clustering algorithm, namely, DIC doc-K-means initial centroid selection based on dissimilarity, to improve the performance of text document clustering.As shown in Figure1, select the number of cluster centers. The randomness of K-means clustering algorithm in the selection of the number of initial cluster centers affects the clustering effect. When the number of clusters is not appropriate and the selected points are isolated points or noise points, it is often prone to local optimal solutions, which affects the effect of clustering.

"optimal solutions, which affects the effect of clustering. In order to solve the problem of the number of cluster centers, Sohil et al. proposed a robust clustering algorithm (robust). Continuous clustering (RCC), which does not need to know the number of clusters in advance, calculates the number of cluster centers by iteratively updating the objective function, and achieves good results in experiments, which greatly improves the clustering performance. Some scholars also determine the number of clusters according to the effectiveness index of clustering, such as CH index, DB index, and KL index [23-30].Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointData mining process.On high-dimensional nonlinear separable data, due to the diversity and high dimension of current data, it is difficult for general clustering algorithms to obtain good experimental results on high-dimensional data sets. The eigenvalue decomposition method is applied to solve the approximate solution of relaxation problem, but the solution obtained by eigenvalue decomposition may seriously deviate from the real solution in some cases. Based on clustering analysis, the data are divided into natural group and characteristic description of each group.

"is a kind of data mining technology, and through the appropriate use of the advanced algorithm, it can dig the hidden valuable information, which helps us to improve the quality of the data analysis and interpretation, Q:2. Introduction to Relevant TheoriesClustering is the process of dividing data samples into several subsets. Definition of clustering: the data in the same cluster are similar, but the data in different clusters are not similar. Cluster is the convergence of points in the test space. The distance between data points in the same cluster is smaller than that between any two data points in different clusters. The basic idea of clustering is to divide the data objects according to the similarity of attributes, divide the data objects with high similarity into the same cluster, and divide the data with low similarity into different clusters. Researchers observe the actual distribution of data objects through the final division results.The main idea of R-means clustering algorithm is to map the original data set to the high-dimensional space to make it linearly separable in the high-dimensional space, which effectively alleviates the problem of nonlinear separability of data. However, these algorithms often have some shortcomings: first, the selection of functions is a difficult problem at present.

"some shortcomings: first, the selection of functions is a difficult problem at present. Due to the wide variety of functions, it is more important to select appropriate functions. Second, the complexity of the existing clustering algorithm is high, and it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution in the solution process. Finally, in order to improve the performance of clustering algorithms, most proposed clustering algorithms have more model constraints and more parameters. Most model parameters are three parameters or more, but parameter adjustment is a complex process, and many models are highly sensitive to parameters. For most data sets, in order to achieve good clustering effect, it takes a lot of time and labor cost to adjust the parameters.By selecting the appropriate function and using the nonlinear mapping ability of the function, while improving the clustering performance, the high-dimensional nonlinear separable data become linearly separable after being mapped to the space. In this process, due to the nonconvexity of the proposed model, it is often easy to fall into the local optimal solution in the process of solving. The global optimal solution is obtained by alternating iterations. The model is verified by a large number of experiments.As an unsupervised learning method, clustering algorithm has been developed rapidly.

"by a large number of experiments.As an unsupervised learning method, clustering algorithm has been developed rapidly. Before partition, it is not necessary to give a specific data label in advance, and the data are automatically divided into different clusters through the characteristic attributes of the data. Different clustering algorithms are suitable for different data types. In the process of practical use, the corresponding clustering algorithm needs to be selected according to the type of data set.On the issue of clustering, there is no way to intuitively express the division of clustering. In different divisions, the class mark only plays the role of an indicator and has no practical significance [31-38].Given a data set,(1)wherenrepresents the number of data samples,mrepresents the dimension of data, which is preclustered intokdisjoint clustersC= {C1, ...,Ck}, let usCjis the clustering center. The purpose of R-means algorithm is to find a reasonable division and make the square error between data points and clustering centers as small as possible by choosing Euclidean distance as the judgment criterion.The aim of mean algorithm is to find a reasonable division and make the square error between data point and cluster center as small as possible by choosing Euclidean distance as the judgment criterion.

The data in the above figure show the clustering process of the mean algorithm as an example. First assume that the number of clusters is 3, and the clustering process is shown in Figure3. The square in the figure represents the center of the cluster. Each figure represents the clustering results after iteration. The clustering center changes after each iteration. When the center of the cluster, that is, the mean vector, no longer changes or reaches the maximum number of iterations, the clustering algorithm ends here.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointMean clustering simulation data.Figure 3(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointDemonstration process of mean algorithm.

Data AcquisitionWith the development of the Internet, the amount of network information increases rapidly. In order to help people select useful information efficiently and quickly in the case of information overload, clustering algorithm came into being and has made great progress. The traditional clustering algorithm solves the problem of information overload to a certain extent, especially the classical mean algorithm, which has the advantages of simple operation, fast time, and high efficiency on small low-dimensional data sets. However, it cannot achieve ideal results in high-dimensional, nonlinear, and separable data. Therefore, the emergence of kernel mean algorithm alleviates this problem to a certain extent. The main idea of kernel mean clustering algorithm is to map the original data set to high-dimensional space to make it linearly separable in high-dimensional space, which effectively alleviates the problem of nonlinear separability of data.At present,"

Kernel mean algorithm is a hot issue in the research of high-dimensional data, but these algorithms often have some shortcomings: first, the selection of kernel function is a difficult problem at present. Due to the variety of kernel functions, it is more important to select an appropriate kernel function. Second, the complexity of the existing kernel-based clustering algorithms is high, and it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution in the process of solving. Finally, in order to improve the performance of clustering algorithms, most proposed clustering algorithms have more model constraints and more parameters. Most model parameters are three parameters or more, but parameter adjustment is a complex process, and many models are highly sensitive to parameters. For most data sets, in order to achieve good clustering effect, it takes a lot of time and labor cost to adjust the parameters.In the study of the problems existing in the human resource management system of H Group, questionnaires are mainly used to select the in-service employees of H Group's science and technology logistics, tourism,"

"the key reasons, leading to the problems in the human resource management system of H Group.In order to realize the early warning function of the human resource performance management information system, the evaluation system of the early warning index should be the subsystem of the performance appraisal index system, which is the decomposition index of the performance appraisal index. The establishment of the early warning index system in the stage of performance planning is the basis to realize the early warning function. Second, reasonable processing methods of early warning data are needed; that is, reasonable processing models of early warning data are set, such as binary logic model, fuzzy judgment model, etc., and processing models are selected according to the types of relevant indicators, so as to judge the current performance level through the early warning data processing model. Finally, the ultimate purpose of the early warning function is to ensure the completion of performance objectives. When abnormal performance early warning occurs, the system will analyze the warning results and formulate countermeasures to correct performance errors for employees and managers in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointEarly warning processing process.In the human resources performance management information system using big data, employees can view their own performance data in real time.

According to the nature of clustering, the smaller the intraclass distance is, the closer the data objects in the same cluster are, and the better the clustering quality is. The larger the inner distance, the looser the data objects in the same cluster, and the worse the clustering quality. Therefore, the experimental data verify that the mean clustering algorithm and improved algorithm based on differential evolution have made great progress in improving the stability and effectiveness of clustering results, and significantly improved the clustering quality. The results show that the clustering results and quality of the improved algorithm proposed in this paper are significantly better than the original mean clustering algorithm based on the standard differential evolution algorithm.We randomly selected 500 samples from five years of data from 90 companies, and the remaining 100 samples were used as test sequences to test r-mean clustering. It can be seen that the r-mean clustering reaches convergence after 13 iterations, and the error decreases to the target value, and the network training ends. In the r-means clustering prediction, the sample regression is analysed.The experimental results in Figures6-8show that the average convergence speed of the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is significantly faster than the mean clustering algorithm based on differential evolution on the test data"
