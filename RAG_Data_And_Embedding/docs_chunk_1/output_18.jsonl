"AbstractIn order to improve the effectiveness of college student management and promote the integration of college student management information, this paper applies intelligent sensor algorithms to student management. Moreover, this paper combines uncertainty theory with multisensor data fusion technology to establish a complete set of multisensor data processing tools for student information and provides a complete mathematical theoretical framework for the principles of student management information fusion. In addition, in view of the problem of comparing a large number of mixed data of information sources, it is necessary to transfer the information fragments obtained by each sensor to a common set so that the information fragments expressed in different sets can be integrated. Finally, this paper constructs an intelligent student management model and conducts research in combination with simulation experiments. Through simulation research, it can be known that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the effect of student management.1.

"as the pace of reform in various industries in our country has accelerated, the reform of higher education has also been accelerating year by year, the scale of enrollment has been increasing, and the number of students has also increased steadily. The level of high-level talent training should not only be expressed in quantity, but more importantly, in high standards of quality. This inevitably puts forward higher requirements on management. Many colleges and universities across the country have researched and developed their own student information management systems, but there is no very flexible and practical student information management system software on the market. Therefore, the student information management system based on intelligent sensor algorithms studied in this paper has a certain market value.Management Information System (MIS) is a system composed of people, computers, and other peripheral equipment. It can collect, transmit, store, process, maintain, and use information. The main task of the system is to use computer and network communication technology to maximize the information management of the enterprise. Moreover, it obtains true and accurate data through the investigation and analysis of the resource conditions of the enterprise's human, financial, material, equipment, and technology, which are processed and compiled into various information materials to provide a decision-making basis for managers [1].The design and development of any software"
"conditions of the enterprise's human, financial, material, equipment, and technology, which are processed and compiled into various information materials to provide a decision-making basis for managers [1].The design and development of any software system must follow the general rules of software development in order to ensure better software quality and obtain higher development efficiency [2]. The general process of typical software system development can be divided into five stages: system requirements analysis, design, programming, testing, and maintenance. System requirement analysis is the first stage of software system development, and it is also a very important stage. The result of requirement analysis is the basis of the other four stages, and the analysis result directly affects software system development [3]. The main task of the requirement analysis stage is to put forward the goal that the system is going to achieve and the complete, clear, and specific requirements of the software system that need to be constrained in terms of function, performance, and design [4]. Requirements analysis includes two aspects: functional requirements analysis and nonfunctional requirements analysis. Functional requirements refer to the functions that the software must complete and are business requirements.

"to the functions that the software must complete and are business requirements. Through the functions provided by the software system, users can complete established tasks. Nonfunctional requirements are good expectations for system safety and operating status, including development constraints of software systems, response time, continuous working time, error recovery time, and error prompts [5].With the gradual transformation of China's higher education from \"elite education\" to \"mass education,\" higher education has developed rapidly. The number of enrolled students in colleges and universities has continued to increase, and the scale of running schools has continued to expand. The number of students in the school has grown from a few thousand at the beginning to tens of thousands of people now. The increase in the number of students has also increased the management pressure of the school on various management affairs. In addition, the expansion of the school scale has made the limited educational resources of the school even more scarce. Only by establishing an effective management mechanism, uniformly deploying existing educational resources, and increasing the utilization rate of resources can the needs of school development be met. The student integrated information management system can realize the information and scientific comprehensive management of all aspects of student management, which not only improves the efficiency of school management but also creates"
"development be met. The student integrated information management system can realize the information and scientific comprehensive management of all aspects of student management, which not only improves the efficiency of school management but also creates opportunities for the efficient scheduling of school education resources and the improvement of management quality.Based on the abovementioned analysis, this paper combines the intelligent sensor algorithm to construct the student management information system, analyzes the information fusion process of the intelligent sensor algorithm to propose an improved algorithm, and verifies the performance of the system in this paper.2. Related WorkIn the era of the information society and the knowledge economy, the construction of informatization and digital campuses is a hot spot in the construction of universities at home and abroad. The concept of a digital campus was first proposed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. After years of hard work, a more mature digital campus model has been constructed. Generally, foreign universities have their own correspondingly stable technical teams for information systems. The users provide services and technical support. As a branch of the educational administration and teaching management system, the student information management system is relatively mature in terms of business and technical performance [6]. In addition, foreign universities have always paid attention"
"As a branch of the educational administration and teaching management system, the student information management system is relatively mature in terms of business and technical performance [6]. In addition, foreign universities have always paid attention to the establishment of laws and regulations in the process of building management systems. Software designers have their own copyrights. By assigning different permissions to different software applications, users can legally share information to improve work efficiency and reduce software costs [7]. Among them, the representative research result is the SIF (schools interoperability framework) education information technology standard. It was originally initiated and formulated by some American companies and related educational organizations. The goal is to solve the current resource sharing problem in American universities. Educational information technology standard solutions enable different application programs of various university management to be operated by each other and achieve the purpose of data resource sharing through this authorized interactive operation [8].Although the management level of student information has gradually transitioned to computer software system management and some colleges and universities have corresponding material inputs and have arranged special personnel for management, they lack supporting software development, and software management is often a mere formality.

"system management and some colleges and universities have corresponding material inputs and have arranged special personnel for management, they lack supporting software development, and software management is often a mere formality. Other colleges and universities are committed to independent research and development, and actively set up special departments to be responsible for the development and promotion of the school′s internal management software. Although the developed software has powerful functions and can fully meet the needs of student information management, due to the lack of communication and coordination with various functional departments in the school, the developed software cannot adapt to the specific management of each functional department requirements, resulting in software being abandoned by managers after a period of use, and formalism, which to a large extent caused a waste of resources [9]. The theory of digital campus has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Colleges and universities have begun to invest in the construction of various hardware equipment and software systems according to their actual needs, including the construction of campus wired and wireless networks; various teaching, scientific research, office management, and other application system software development and introduction have formed their own informatization construction systems [10].Literature [11] uses Visual Basic 6.0 as the program development language and the"
"scientific research, office management, and other application system software development and introduction have formed their own informatization construction systems [10].Literature [11] uses Visual Basic 6.0 as the program development language and the Access database as the realization of a relational database. It has developed a set of features for teaching and student management in colleges and universities. The functions include student employment management, grade management, course management, student status management, and a student information management system for class management. Literature [12] designed a set of postgraduate information management systems, using Microsoft's NET technology and XML-based mature technology as the technical guarantee; SQL Server000 as the system database; different users are assigned different roles to improve management efficiency, and standardize the purpose of graduate student information management. Literature [13] adopts a multilayer application software architecture and a development route based on distributed object technology and component technology.

At present, the key structure and some subsystems have been developed, and the inspiring new look brought by the new architecture and technology to the management information system is beginning to appear, and it also provides new ideas for the design of the information system. Literature [14] uses the MVC design pattern to design and implement a student management system on the J2EE platform and uses the popular open source framework Struts for development. Literature [15] through the research on the college student management system based on the C/S and B/S mixed modes, realized college student status management, student daily management, student-related management, counselor management, office management, student information query and statistics. It expounds the advantages of the C/S and B/S hybrid development models, and puts forward the idea of \"establishing a university student management data center shared by the whole school.\"The analysis of the abovementioned data found that for the university student management system, the successful experience can only be used as a reference and reference.

"is not feasible to copy a certain advanced experience and management system completely. It is necessary for each university to develop a suitable one according to its actual situation. The management information system based on its own management mode is also the purpose of the development of this system.3. Research on the Multisensor Data Fusion Method of Student Management InformationThe essence of students' daily information management is actually the integrated navigation of multiple students. The essence of integrated navigation is multisensor data fusion, which realizes accurate positioning of the carrier position through the loose and tight coupling of MIMU/GPS, MEMS inertial sensor, magnetometer, and GPS combination ways to achieve accurate measurement of the carrier's attitude. Common sensor data fusion methods are mainly based on filtering.For the comparison of a large number of mixed data sources, it is necessary to transfer the student management information fragments obtained by each sensor to a common set, so that the student management information fragments expressed in different sets can be integrated. Before processing student management information fragments, it is necessary to use a function to project the provided knowledge fragments into a different collection, and then it is necessary to connect these collections and express their relationships.Combine two sets of operations through the subdivision and coarsening, adjustment, and imbalance of the"
"the provided knowledge fragments into a different collection, and then it is necessary to connect these collections and express their relationships.Combine two sets of operations through the subdivision and coarsening, adjustment, and imbalance of the recognition frame, the student management information fragment can be transferred between any two sets of credibilityPl(⋅). The following will focus on introducing a special extended operation based on these two types of operations. Similarly, this extension can also transfer the credibility of any recognition framework to other recognition spaces.Specific steps are as follows:(1)The algorithm determines an incompletely defined likelihood functionPle(.) within the scope of the recognition frameE.(2)The algorithm calculatesPls(./B⊆Ee), that is, the incomplete likelihood function oncwhen subset B ofEeis truly valid.(3)The algorithm calculatesEr,Er⊆Ee, which belongs to a set of elementEeand is associated with any given element ofEs. Elements inEsthat are incompatible withEeare eliminated throughPls(./B⊆Ee) = 0. Conversely, elements inEethat are incompatible withEsare identified byEe−Er.(4)With the conclusion data of the first three steps, the algorithm begins to build an extended operation, which is divided into three steps. First, the algorithm uses the formula [16]:(1)To find the value of the likelihood functionPlsr(A×B) ofEs×Er.

Then, a specific algorithm is used to determine the mass functionmsr(.) with the least specificity corresponding to its likelihood value. Finally, the formula is used [17]:(2)To determine the mass distribution functionms(.) on the recognition frame Es.The essence of the algorithm with the smallest specific mass function is to determine the mass functionm(.) associated with the incompletely defined likelihood functionPl(.) on the recognition spaceE. Because of the uncertainty of this quality function, it is necessary to find the function with the highest evidence strength. We define the specific function Sp (m) as(3)In order to limit student management information outside the facts, it is necessary to find the smallest Sp (m). The algorithm update flowchart is shown in Figure1[18].Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe smallest specificm(.) algorithm.During the update process, it should be noted that the initializationm(.) process must makem(E) = 1. After processing a likelihood subset,m(E) needs to be set to an uncertain partial quality. When choosingBj⊂E, we need to consider the order in order to reduce the cardinality. If the cardinality of the two sets is equal, it will not be considered first.

When Δj> 0 is judged, it is necessary to examine the main element [19] A ofm(.), which must satisfy formula (3).(4)Finally, it is worth noting that the solutions derived from different problem conditions are not unique. The process of student information recognition is set as the recognition frameEcis as follows:(5)Among them,(6)According to the abovementioned identification framework,Hi(i= 1-6) is the situational variable. Now, it is necessary to determine the attribute uj corresponding to each scenario variable. The attributes are the longitude, latitude, altitude, roll angle, pitch angle, and yaw angle of the carrier, a total of six variables, which are recorded as follows [19]:(7)The collection is as follows:(8)In the set,nrepresents thenkinds of calculation methods, which are selected according to the actual situation. Each attribute may have less than or equal tonkinds of solution methods, and some attributes are still coupled for a certain solution method. For the convenience of building the model, the dimension is uniformly set ton. It is worth noting that taking the largest dimension does not violate the actual situation, because each attribute is directly or indirectly coupled.In addition, we identify several important vectors [20]:(9)Among them,Acis the student management information of the three-axis magnetometer;Agis the student management"
"violate the actual situation, because each attribute is directly or indirectly coupled.In addition, we identify several important vectors [20]:(9)Among them,Acis the student management information of the three-axis magnetometer;Agis the student management information of the three-axis accelerometer;Aois the student management information of the three-axis gyroscope; andAris the student management information of the GPS satellite receiver.Start with the observation data. The vectorAc,Ag,Ao,Aritself is not a set, so it is necessary to transform the four sets of vectors into a set. The abovementioned four sets of vectors can be transformed to the set (8), that is, each single element in the set is composed of four sets of vectors calculated by the navigation algorithm.This section mainly analyzes the collection management. The research object is the collection (8). The application of the four sets of vectors of the collection (9) will be explained in detail in the next section. We use the attributeλas an example.Step 1.The algorithm calculates the likelihood function of each subsetλi. The specific calculation is shown as follows [21]:(10)In the formula, [λ] is the standard value. Because this value cannot be collected in real time, one or more sensors with the highest reliability can be determined in advance according to the way of scenario simulation, and the [λ] calculated by using these reliable sensors is the standard output.The second step is as follows: according to the"
"time, one or more sensors with the highest reliability can be determined in advance according to the way of scenario simulation, and the [λ] calculated by using these reliable sensors is the standard output.The second step is as follows: according to the reliability analysis of each sensor variable, the algorithm removes the unreliable sensor attributes; the mass functionmij(.) of each set is calculated according to the minimum specific mass function method, and the reliability is eliminated.The third step is as follows: the algorithm updates the student management information. When the student management informationλkat the previous moment is transformed into the student management informationλk+1at the next moment, the student management information at the two moments needs to be merged. Among them, simple weighting is one way. After that, we solve the expansion operation which is as follows:(1)Ekis the collection of student management information at the previous moment(2)Ek+1is the collection of student management information x.z at a later time(3)Plk(.) is the Bayesian simple integration of the likelihood function distribution at the previous moment(4)Plk+1(./B⊆Ek) is the distribution of the likelihood function at a later time of Bayesian simple integration, which may have a value of 0 or 1(5)According to the mass distribution function of the specific set of attributes, the algorithm determines the corresponding conversion modelThe reliability management of knowledge"
"later time of Bayesian simple integration, which may have a value of 0 or 1(5)According to the mass distribution function of the specific set of attributes, the algorithm determines the corresponding conversion modelThe reliability management of knowledge fragments is an important foundation in the process of sensor data fusion. For the problem of ensuring the stability (robustness) of the output signal in the solution process of the integrated navigation system, the reliability management of the student management information is extremely important. The combination stage usually encourages the use of a simple weighted combination of the management information of each sensor student, but the shortcomings are also obvious. It is very sensitive to the selected parameters, which often leads to low robustness of the output signal and susceptibility to external interference.In the reliability function theory, if the source identification frame isEe, then the mass function onEeism(A), where ∀A⊂Ee. If the reliability of the source is knownq∈ [0,1], the unreliable part can be eliminated to obtain(11)The function of reliability function rejection is to reduce the performance of the uncertainty part of the sensor by a factor (1−q). That is, it reduces the mass distribution of all elements and redistributes the mass on the recognition frame.

"That is, it reduces the mass distribution of all elements and redistributes the mass on the recognition frame. Moreover, the overall credibility is reduced by (1−q), so the uncertainty of the overall Ee is increased. This elimination operation retains the original evaluation and improves the evaluation between total uncertainties. In addition, for the likelihood function, a similar method is used here, as shown in the following formula:(12)Here is the application process of multisensor student management information reliability management in the overall system, as shown in Figure2.If the MTI data is ax,y, or o, and the IMU data is ae, ay, or loz, the reliability expression is as follows:(13)Among them,irepresents the student management information sequence, andjrepresents the sensor sequence. The essence of this kind of reliability expression is the expression of the accuracy of the sensor under the management information of different students when the sensor is not damaged. Therefore, the expression defects are also obvious:(1)It can only bind offline, and it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the binding. The first point is that when the reliability database is used for binding, the accuracy of the expression itself cannot be measured according to formula (13), that is, the reliability of the algorithm needs to be verified.(2)When it is applied, it must be searched by the interpolation method, and the accuracy is further degraded.(3)The most important point is that"
"cannot be measured according to formula (13), that is, the reliability of the algorithm needs to be verified.(2)When it is applied, it must be searched by the interpolation method, and the accuracy is further degraded.(3)The most important point is that it is impossible to determine the true operating status of the sensor, which introduces hidden dangers to the update of student management information in a real application environment.There is no doubt that how to optimally combine student management information from different sensors is the core content of data fusion, but this function is also the most difficult part to achieve. The influencing factors mainly include the following: the difference of sensors, the diversity of the identification framework that can express the available student management information, the rigorous mathematical modeling expression of the problem, and the handling of conflicts between signal sources. Numerous identification frameworks provide a large number of combination rules. Therefore, how to select the optimal combination has become the most difficult and most critical problem.Here, the D-S evidence theory is used for synthesis, and this synthesis rule reflects the combined effect of evidence. We give several trust functions based on different evidence on the same identification framework. If several batches of evidence are incompletely conflicting, you can use the D-S evidence theory to calculate a new trust function.This trust function"
"We give several trust functions based on different evidence on the same identification framework. If several batches of evidence are incompletely conflicting, you can use the D-S evidence theory to calculate a new trust function.This trust function can be used as the trust function under the joint action of the several batches of evidence, and the trust function is called the orthogonal sum of the original trust functions.(14)where(15)The factorKis called the conflict coefficient, which represents the inconsistency of data fusion, that is, a measure of the degree of conflict between different quality functions.We assume that the setEkof student management information at the previous moment and the setEk+1of student management informationAk+1at the next moment are two different independent signal sources and that the two sets of signal sources can determine the reliability distribution of the signal.The identification framework is as follows:Ek= {λ1k,λ2k,λ3k, ...,λnk},Ek+1= {λ1k+1,λ2k+1,λ3k+1, ...,λnk+1};The mass function assignment isAccording to Dempster combination rules (14) and (15), the probability assignment of each attribute is calculated as follows:m({λi})(16)Finally, the calculatedm(A) is the basic probability assignment (BPA) of attribute 3.The overall framework of the established model is shown in Figure3.The model summarizes the contents of the first three sections, and the overall framework is divided into two ways.

Moreover, it can enable the head teacher and subject teachers to discover the problems of each student in a relatively short period of time and take immediate measures to control the spread of the problems. At the same time, all queries are open to students so that all students can grasp their true situation. With the help of all teachers, they can control their words and deeds during school so as to gradually cultivate personal self-discipline and learn to abide by rules. The information in the system can also be notified to parents of students in time through the home-school communication system, so that parents can keep track of their children's performance at school. This is convenient to enhance the understanding of students and is more conducive to communication with the head teacher and the school.

"ConclusionWhen colleges and universities conduct student management under the traditional management mode and the stand-alone mode of computer information systems, most of the time of each stage of the work of the management personnel is used to manually search for data and statistical information from various tables. Even if a computer information system is used in management work, it is limited to simple data processing, and there is no connection between different management tasks on the computer. Moreover, the role of the computer only improves the efficiency of management staff in handling daily business. The data of management work is communicated in a static way, and the data is completely relied on manual mutual verification and collaborative work, which causes the school's management links to be disconnected from each other and affects the overall management order of the school. This paper combines the intelligent sensor algorithm to construct the student management information system, analyzes the information fusion process of the intelligent sensor algorithm, proposes an improved algorithm, and verifies the performance of the system in this paper. Through simulation research, we can see that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the management effect of students.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis study was sponsored by Chifeng University.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe labeled dataset used to"

"AbstractIn order to explore the quality management efficiency of applying big data and artificial intelligence in nursing quality index, a method of building a nursing management platform integrating nursing indicators and nursing events is proposed. Based on the investigation of the application demand of nursing information system, the method achieves timely data sharing and transmission through WLAN technology and realizes nursing management monitoring, nursing quality index enquiry, and automatic statistical analysis under the vertical management mode of nursing. The results showed that 77 people (73%) thought the time decreased, 19 people (18%) thought the time was the same, and 9 people (7%) thought the time increased. In terms of intelligent application and big data of nursing information management system, there is a significant difference in nursing management efficiency before and after using nursing management information system (P< 0.001). The nursing management control platform is designed and applied, and the nursing quality control method and actual management process are improved, which is very good for strengthening nursing quality management. The overall optimization of the quality control process is realized, which helps to mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of nursing staff and continuously improve the effectiveness of nursing management and nursing efficiency.1.

"which helps to mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of nursing staff and continuously improve the effectiveness of nursing management and nursing efficiency.1. IntroductionWith the development and progress of the society, people's demand for medical treatment has been upgraded from the treatment of diseases to the integration of medical care. Nursing quality evaluation is an objective indicator reflecting this demand and is the key link and important basis of nursing quality management [1]. Scientific, reasonable, unified, and standardized nursing quality indicators are the main tools for evaluating nursing quality, with the help of which nursing services can be evaluated and supervised throughout the whole process [2]. Correct and effective use and analysis of nursing quality index data can timely find out the problems existing in nursing quality and safety management and provide a basis for managers to make decisions. In the context of the era of big data, nursing information discipline, which organically combines nursing science, computer science, and information science, emerges at the historic moment [3]. Nursing informatics will identify and process the collected data to provide the basis and direction for managers to make decisions or behaviors. The nursing quality management information system refers to the nursing quality score mark. Input the data into the computer, establish the database, store the information with the computer, carry out statistical analysis,"
"to make decisions or behaviors. The nursing quality management information system refers to the nursing quality score mark. Input the data into the computer, establish the database, store the information with the computer, carry out statistical analysis, and output the nursing work quality of each department, so as to accurately evaluate the quality of nursing work, find defects, and promote the continuous improvement of nursing quality [4]. How to use big data and artificial intelligence to optimize the function of nursing quality management information system is a topic that needs to be actively explored and solved by nursing management personnel. Some hospitals in China have started to use the hospital information system (HIS) based on mobile network equipment and distributed software development to improve the working efficiency and service quality. The nursing department cooperates with software companies [5]. We design and apply the nursing quality management system with smart phone as the terminal and big data analysis and nursing quality control platform as the core, adopt the mode of pilot before rolling out, and apply it in all nursing units of the hospital; it has promoted the informatization construction of nursing quality management and achieved good results in shortening the time of nursing quality control, optimizing the flow of nursing quality control and strengthening the quality control and tracking management in the process of nursing service [6].Guleng et"
"quality management and achieved good results in shortening the time of nursing quality control, optimizing the flow of nursing quality control and strengthening the quality control and tracking management in the process of nursing service [6].Guleng et al. proposed to update the national nursing sensitive quality index database and identified 9 indicators, including 2 structural indicators: the ratio of specialized nurses to other nursing staff and the number of nursing hours per day of patients, 2 process indicators: nursing staff satisfaction and patient satisfaction with health education, and 5 outcome indicators: skin integrity care, falls, incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infection, patients' satisfaction with general nursing, and patients' satisfaction with pain management [7]. Through the development, testing, and implementation of the nursing sensitivity index database, Cz et al. effectively collected nursing staffing, patient flow adverse events, hand hygiene, and other management data, which can be used to measure nursing performance, evaluate patient prognosis, and determine the quality and safety of nursing practice. In order to improve the quality of nursing, the \"web version of nursing quality evaluation and improvement system\" was developed, and the nursing quality database included 260 nursing indicators [8]. Dey et al. integrated the traditional strategies of Walker and Avante based on the concept matrix of Holzemer's model of health care research"
"and improvement system\" was developed, and the nursing quality database included 260 nursing indicators [8]. Dey et al. integrated the traditional strategies of Walker and Avante based on the concept matrix of Holzemer's model of health care research results. Four structural indicators were finally determined: 24 h patient nursing hours and nurse staffing (personnel mix, skill mix, and personnel ratio), and four outcome indicators were determined: the incidence of pressure sores, the incidence of falls (injuries), hospital-acquired infections, and patient (family) nursing satisfaction [9]. By investigating six non-university teaching hospitals in different regions, Zhou established five nursing sensitivity quality indicators, including screening for mental disorders, observation of mental disorders, malnutrition, and standardized pain assessment for patients after surgery in the rehabilitation room and hospital units. Risk identification of patients in hospital can be realized to effectively measure the quality of nursing [10].On the basis of current research, a nursing management platform combining nursing indexes and nursing events was proposed. Based on the survey of application needs of nursing information system, the method achieves data sharing and transmission in time through WLAN technology and realizes nursing management monitoring, nursing quality index inquiry, and automatic statistical analysis under vertical nursing management mode.

"method achieves data sharing and transmission in time through WLAN technology and realizes nursing management monitoring, nursing quality index inquiry, and automatic statistical analysis under vertical nursing management mode. The experimental results showed that there was a significant difference in nursing management efficiency before and after artificial intelligence and big data were applied to nursing information management system (P< 0.001). The design and application of nursing management and control platform can comprehensively improve the nursing quality management and control methods and actual processes, which is very beneficial to strengthen nursing quality management. The overall optimization of quality control process will help to fully mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of employees, and continuously improve the effectiveness of nursing management and nursing efficiency.2. Application of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data2.1. Establishing a Medical Care Quality Management SystemIn order to meet the application requirements of nursing information system, the nursing information system has timely data sharing and transmission with his database, big data platform, and medical information docking system through WLAN technology and realized the functions of nursing management monitoring, statistical analysis of nursing quality indicators, quality control, and automatic feedback under the vertical nursing management mode. The hospital has established a"
"through WLAN technology and realized the functions of nursing management monitoring, statistical analysis of nursing quality indicators, quality control, and automatic feedback under the vertical nursing management mode. The hospital has established a nursing informatization research and development team, which is composed of the director of nursing management, director of nursing department, some head nurses, nursing backbone, and engineers, and holds regular special meetings to jointly develop and improve system functions. The information flow of the nursing quality indicator information system is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation flow of the nursing quality indicator information system.Through the data cleaning and processing, the relevant data of nursing quality indicators are presented in the form of a variety of visual charts. Diversified charts show problems with quality of care from a variety of perspectives, so that weaknesses can be quickly identified and corrected to reduce the occurrence of quality of care problems. The \"number of cases of event type and department\" in adverse events is taken as an example for specific explanation. According to the selected year, quarter, month, and day, the number of cases of department of event type is presented in the form of data table and histogram. The types of reported events were presented in the form of pie chart, line chart, and Platonic chart, and the number of cases of event types and"
"and day, the number of cases of department of event type is presented in the form of data table and histogram. The types of reported events were presented in the form of pie chart, line chart, and Platonic chart, and the number of cases of event types and departments were compared in the form of year-on-year trend chart according to different conditions [11]. At the same time, the data of the content of adverse events were extracted, the fishbone diagram was drawn, and the major cause, medium cause, and minor cause were analyzed. In addition, the presentation of some data correlated the nurses involved in the indicators with the patients, and the responsibility was transferred to people to avoid the occurrence of buck passing. Nursing managers can use PDCA or failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) management mode to manage nursing staff who present nursing quality problems and problems related to them from all angles and levels [12].2.1.1. The Application of Medical Care Quality Management System(i)System Login. The computer of the nurse station can be equipped with medical and nursing quality management software, and all nurses can log in through the work number, which can facilitate the nurses to query the feedback information and nursing quality inspection information, and the steering group can also query the nursing management quality at any time.(ii)Set Inspection Standards.

"information and nursing quality inspection information, and the steering group can also query the nursing management quality at any time.(ii)Set Inspection Standards. We improve the nursing quality information base and input the index items and quality standards to be monitored into the system, so as to form a more standardized and reasonable structured information, which is helpful for the inspection team to check, for example, in the nursing department, nursing data collection items have been added to the reporting system of bad nursing problems, such as the cause of patients' falls, treatment measures and the degree of injury, etc., and the system can automatically generate indexes such as the rate of patients' falls and the number of accidents.(iii)Quality Control of Smart Phones. Nursing quality monitoring personnel realize quality monitoring at the bedside of patients through smart phones and take the inspection standard as the control index to timely input, store, and report the existing nursing problems; if the submission is not completed in time, the system will send a reminder message. At present, the hospital has achieved bedside monitoring, such as nursing document management, ICU nursing quality, graded nursing, patient satisfaction, quality nursing quality control, and emergency nursing management. Comparison of the incidence (%) of falls/falls in the nursing safety management application information system is shown in Table1. Comparison of the incidence of"
"patient satisfaction, quality nursing quality control, and emergency nursing management. Comparison of the incidence (%) of falls/falls in the nursing safety management application information system is shown in Table1. Comparison of the incidence of stress injury (%) of nursing safety management application information system is shown in Table2.It is mainly composed of nursing sensitive index and clinical basic quality index, which is involved in the reporting, review, control, and tracking of nursing quality indicators. The system can automatically extract the relevant data of statistical query and decision analysis module, nursing adverse event reporting system, nursing electronic evaluation sheet, and other modules, realizing the function of systematic query, automatic statistics, analysis, and feedback of nursing indicators. The nursing department and quality control staff can check the indicators and quality control progress of the whole hospital and various departments at any time through the nursing management platform and the dashboard of the nursing management end of the medical letter smart phone. It is sensitive to the actual nursery-patient ratio, the incidence of falling and falling, and the incidence of unplanned extubation. For example, the incidence rate of unplanned extubation in the whole hospital in every quarter can be queried and analyzed.Table  1.Comparison of the incidence (%) of falls/falls in nursing safety management application information"

For example, the incidence rate of unplanned extubation in the whole hospital in every quarter can be queried and analyzed.Table  1.Comparison of the incidence (%) of falls/falls in nursing safety management application information system.QuarterlyNumber of cases occurring (example)Number of inpatients (person)Incidencex2ThePvaluePublic beforeQ 1585670.07853.2610.017After the misfortuneQ 2498560.0652Q 3386320.0432Q 4397650.0311Table  2.Comparison of the incidence (%) of stress injury in nursing safety management application information system.QuarterlyNumber of cases occurring (example)Number of inpatients (person)Incidencex2ThePvaluePublic beforeQ 1585670.05826.3110.041After the misfortuneQ 2498560.0456Q 3386320.0321Q 4397650.0211As can be seen from Tables1and2, after the trend chi-square test, there were significant differences in the incidence of fall/fall and stress injury in the four quarters (P< 0.05). Specifically, the incidence of falls/falls and stress injuries decreased significantly from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.2.2. The Application Effect of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Medical Care Quality ManagementThrough the application of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in medical care quality management, 79% of nursing staff said that the system greatly saves the time of nursing quality control, and nursing staff can realize the automatic generation of nursing quality management reports"
"intelligence and big data in medical care quality management, 79% of nursing staff said that the system greatly saves the time of nursing quality control, and nursing staff can realize the automatic generation of nursing quality management reports through the input of nursing quality management problems in the system, and automatic statistics of nursing problems can help save the statistical time of nursing management personnel, which can not only shorten the time of nursing quality control but also improve the efficiency of nursing [13]. This is shown in Table3.Table  3.Comparative analysis of nursing management efficiency before and after the application of information system (min/month, ±S).EyesBad care eventsNumber of nurses under controlData collation and control accounting analysisSampling inspection data sorting and control accounting analysisIntroduction: computer data collation and control accounting analysisPublic before9982.66 ± 15.269998.22 ± 33.789980.11 ± 16.08After the misfortune68.55 ± 1.0164.33 ± 6.74141.22 ± 9.01x21995.675980.2113272.343ThePvalue<0.001<0.001<0.001As can be seen from Table3, the comparative analysis of nursing management efficiency before and after the application of nursing management information system has significant difference (P< 0.001), which shows that the nursing management efficiency has been significantly improved after implementation.The accuracy, completeness, and objective authenticity of traditional manual statistics are"
"information system has significant difference (P< 0.001), which shows that the nursing management efficiency has been significantly improved after implementation.The accuracy, completeness, and objective authenticity of traditional manual statistics are difficult to be guaranteed, which affects the management effect. The big data platform integrates the previously dispersed, isolated, and static information into complete, continuous, and shareable dynamic information, which improves the accuracy, objectivity, and continuity of nursing quality management. As long as the quality inspection data in the nursing quality management information system supported by the big data platform are timely input, the background can automatically and accurately calculate the scores, analyze the proportion of various problems, and realize the objective quantification of the quality index data. The system accurately analyzes the daily work quality of each nurse and checks the details that can be traced, so that the behavior of nursing staff can be more standardized, to ensure and improve the quality of nursing safety.3.

"the system to improve the nursing quality standard information base.Analysis of hospital data after using the system is shown in Table4; 73% of nurses believe that the use of the system can shorten the time consumption of nursing quality control. Nurses only need to input the complete quality control problems into the system. The system can automatically classify and count various reports and nursing problems in nursing quality management, which can effectively reduce the time used by nursing managers for input and statistics. At the same time, it can also inquire and supervise the nursing quality problems in real time, which greatly saves the time of nursing quality control and improves the work efficiency.Table  4.Comparison of analysis time of nursing quality problems input before and after using the nursing quality management information system by nurses.ProjectNumber of peoplePercentageTime reduction7773The time is equal1918Time increases97Traditional Manual Statistics.

"AbstractIn modern times, with the development of industrialized society and the invention of clocks and watches, people have become more and more concerned about institutionalization, and higher education time and space have also shown the characteristics of institutionalization. In modern times, educational informatization has brought challenges and opportunities for educational reform and development. The vigorous development of education informatization has also produced changes in higher education spatiotemporally. For example, the rise of catechism and online learning, the importance of fragmented time, the development of space toward virtualization, and the expansion of interactive space for interpersonal interactions. In addition, the enrichment and sharing of educational materials, the informatization, and big data of educational management also contribute to the improvement of time efficiency and optimization of time structure in higher education. With the background of education under the new normal, this paper briefly analyzes the current situation of education informatization construction in colleges and universities from the perspective of education managers, and addresses the current situation and problems of teaching management informatization construction, such as organizational structure dominated by pyramidal functional departments, inefficiency, inability to connect work, difficulty in work gap, difficulty in horizontal coordination, and closed information."
"management informatization construction, such as organizational structure dominated by pyramidal functional departments, inefficiency, inability to connect work, difficulty in work gap, difficulty in horizontal coordination, and closed information. A work breakdown structure (WBS) based project management theory and work structure decomposition method are proposed. This paper finds that the improved association rule mining algorithm can improve the efficiency of teaching management practice in colleges and universities by more than 14.58%, which is an important reference value for college management informatization.1. IntroductionVocational education is an integral part of China's education system and is a special form of education [1]. In the field of development, vocational education crosses the three boundaries of industry, occupation, and education; and in the division of education levels, vocational education is divided into primary, secondary, as well as higher levels [2]. In 2005, the Ministry of Education issued the Decision of the State Council on Vigorously Developing Vocational Education, which pointed out that \"the construction of education informatization should be strengthened and the application of modern educational technology in education teaching should be promoted,\" which initially put the development of informatization on the charter of vocational education development and vigorously promoted the development of vocational education informatization [3]."
"technology in education teaching should be promoted,\" which initially put the development of informatization on the charter of vocational education development and vigorously promoted the development of vocational education informatization [3]. Since the release of the Ten-Year Development Plan for Education Informatization (2011-2020), China's education informatization has stepped into a new stage of development, and the strategic status of education informatization has reached an unprecedented new height [4]. Education informatization has become an important part of the process of education modernization, and it has become a strategic goal to promote the reform and development of education in China by accelerating the process of informatization and driving education modernization with education informatization [5]. From 2011 to 2015, China issued the Opinions of the Ministry of Education on Accelerating the Development of Vocational Education Informatization (2012), the Construction Plan of Modern Vocational Education System (2014-2020), the Decision of the State Council on Accelerating the Development of Modern Vocational Education (2013), the Specifications for the Construction of Digital Campus in Vocational Colleges and Universities (2014), and the Plan on Deepening Several Opinions on Deepening Teaching Reform of Vocational Education and Comprehensively Improving Talent Cultivation Quality (2014), \"Guidance on Comprehensively and Deeply Promoting Education"
"Colleges and Universities (2014), and the Plan on Deepening Several Opinions on Deepening Teaching Reform of Vocational Education and Comprehensively Improving Talent Cultivation Quality (2014), \"Guidance on Comprehensively and Deeply Promoting Education Informatization during the 13th Five-Year Plan\" (2015), \"Action Plan for the New Development of Higher Vocational Education Plan (2015-2018)\" and other policies [6,7]. The development of vocational education informatization has gradually shifted from the primary development stage to the in-depth development stage, which is not only a major development opportunity but also a great challenge for higher vocational institutions [8].At present, there are some achievements in the research related to education informatization in China, but it is still in the initial stage [9]. The research in vocational education informatization lags behind the research in basic education informatization and higher education informatization [10]. With the continuous development of China's economy and technology, the original system, structure, and talent training mode of vocational education can no longer adapt to the rapidly developing Chinese economy and the rapidly changing industrial structure, and the original vocational education must be reformed and developed, otherwise it will be difficult to adapt to the development needs of modern society [11].

"and the original vocational education must be reformed and developed, otherwise it will be difficult to adapt to the development needs of modern society [11]. Vocational education informatization is a huge push to promote the reform and development of vocational education. To make the work of vocational education informatization develop in a fast, appropriate and steady direction, it is necessary to continuously understand the current development level of vocational education informatization in each region to provide a reference basis for the promotion of vocational education informatization nationwide [12]. With the ultimate goal of better promoting the construction of educational informatization in higher vocational colleges in our region, this study takes the requirements put forward in the Opinions of the Ministry of Education on Accelerating the Development of Vocational Education Informatization as the purpose, combines the local characteristics of regional vocational education, analyzes the current situation and problems of educational informatization in higher vocational colleges, puts forward improvement measures and suggestions, and provides better educational informatization construction work for each higher vocational college reference [13].2.

"college reference [13].2. Related WorkAn important prerequisite for any concept to be of use is that it has a relatively clear connotation and extension. The concept of education informatization was first introduced in the United States in the 1990s [14]. In the 1990s, the U.S. government proposed the \"information superhighway\" plan in the \"National Information Infrastructure\" (N11 for short) [15]. The plan is to promote the development of an integrated information service system with the Internet as the core and to promote the extensive application of information technology in various fields of society, especially the application of information technology in education and the deep integration of information technology and subject teaching as an important way of education reform [16].At present, the term education informatization has been widely used in China and is recognized by experts and scholars. However, the connotation of the concept of educational informatization is diverse, and domestic experts and scholars who have studied educational informatization have put forward their own understanding [17]. Throughout, various scholars have defined the concept of educational informatization from their own perspectives, and the central idea is the same, that is, the application of information technology to education [18]. Specifically, from the technical level, educational informatization can be the integration of digital, networked, intelligent, and multimedia education; from"
"central idea is the same, that is, the application of information technology to education [18]. Specifically, from the technical level, educational informatization can be the integration of digital, networked, intelligent, and multimedia education; from the educational level, educational informatization is a new educational concept with openness, sharing, interactivity, and collaboration, and we can regard educational informatization as a process of pursuing information-based education [19]. In summary, educational informatization aims at the development of students' abilities, the improvement of teachers' professional abilities and teaching standards, the sharing and use of global educational resources, and the overall development of schools [20]. The statistics of word frequencies revealed that infrastructure, informatization resources, teachers' informatization ability, management, and input, teaching, and talents were used more frequently, indicating that the research content of the existing studies was mostly investigated from these aspects.Vocational education informatization is an important foundation and component of education informatization and national informatization, and [21] defined vocational education informatization as \"the process in which teachers and students of vocational education use information technology to promote the teaching reform and development of vocational education on the basis of the network environment, so as to modernize vocational"
"informatization as \"the process in which teachers and students of vocational education use information technology to promote the teaching reform and development of vocational education on the basis of the network environment, so as to modernize vocational education and meet the needs of the times and society.\" [22] argued that vocational education informatization should be based on complete computer equipment and the Internet, and that vocational education informatization is oriented to vocational education, and its purpose is to improve the application of information technology among teachers and students in vocational institutions, so as to promote the development of vocational education teaching and reform. According to [23], the connotation of vocational education informatization mainly includes: vocational education informatization should be based on complete computer equipment and the Internet; vocational education informatization is oriented to vocational education, and its task is to improve the application of information technology so as to promote the development of vocational education teaching and reform; the quality of teachers in the information environment is the key to the success or failure of vocational education informatization; educational information resources.

"education informatization; educational information resources. The development and construction of educational information resources is the basis and the main task to realize the continuous improvement of educational research level and educational teaching effect. [24] pointed out that \"vocational education informatization refers to the use of multimedia and network information technology in the field of vocational education to promote the comprehensive reform of vocational education and adapt it to the new requirements for the development of vocational education in the informatized society.\" It is believed that the purpose of vocational education informatization is to promote educational reform; therefore, from regulations, policies, resources, talents, etc. related to vocational education informatization are all aspects of the development of education informatization. [25] interpreted informatization and education informatization from the perspective of information flow, analyzed the concept of informatization and the evolution of its connotation, and analyzed the differences between the concepts of education informatization and higher education informatization, and he believed that \"higher education informatization refers to the use of contemporary information technology to transform the higher education system.\"As shown above, it can be said that the informatization of vocational education is a process that is reflected in all aspects of vocational education and teaching."
"to the use of contemporary information technology to transform the higher education system.\"As shown above, it can be said that the informatization of vocational education is a process that is reflected in all aspects of vocational education and teaching. Specifically, it is a systematic project to modernize vocational education by using advanced educational concepts as guidance, applying modern information technology, and focusing on developing and utilizing information resources in order to cultivate innovative talents who can adapt to the requirements of the information society and accelerate the realization of vocational education.3.

By realizing the digitalization of everything from the environment (including equipment, classrooms, etc.), resources (such as books, lecture notes, courseware), to applications (including teaching, learning, management, service, office, etc.), digital space is constructed on the basis of the traditional campus to expand the time and space dimensions of the real campus, enhance the operational efficiency of the traditional campus, expand the business functions of the traditional campus, and finally realize the comprehensive informatization of the educational process in order to achieve the purpose of"

Therefore, the ultimate goal of digital campus construction is to realize education informatization, and digital campus construction is the means for higher education and vocational institutions to realize education informatization.The platform has established 13 subsystems, including the multimedia information release subsystem, asset management subsystem, teaching task inquiry subsystem, classroom inquiry subsystem, online assessment subsystem, and life service system, which can meet different usage needs in the face of different users. Students, teachers, and evil managers of the college can use the platform to manage their own learning, teaching, and business matters.

Inlthe cycle, a setAlof candidatelitemset is generated, and the role of each set inAtis to generate candidate set of frequency sets, and the generation of each set is done by connecting (l− 2) frequency sets with only one different item byKl−1, and the final generated frequency setKlmust be some subset ofAt. It is necessary to verify each element inAtin database to determine whether each element can be added toKl, and it is necessary to scan the database several times during verification. Therefore, the disadvantage of the Apriori algorithm is that generation of the candidate set is too large and the scanning time is too long due to repeatedly scanning database, which is the bottleneck of the Apriori algorithm.To improve the Apriori algorithm and enhance its efficiency, the pruning technique is added to the algorithm to reduce the size of candidate setAlvolume. The pruning technique is added to an algorithm based on the property that an item set belongs to a frequency set and all its subsets are frequency sets, and if there is a (l− 2) subset of a candidate item set inAlthat does not belong to a frequency set (Kl−1), this"

It preliminarily meets the survey and design requirements.Figure6shows the frequency of using devices in teaching of 73 teachers surveyed, from 1 indicating none to 5, indicating that the frequency of use is very often. From the above figure, it can be seen that teachers use information technology equipment very frequently, basically above 3.5 points. However, the frequency of using interactive whiteboards, digital cameras and video cameras, computer labs, and speech rooms is less than 3.5. This means that teachers are not very proficient in using the latest information technology teaching equipment, and the school's training in this area is not very effective. Moreover, the frequency of using computer labs and speech rooms is not high, which also indicates that in the process of implementing information technology teaching, many times it is only for competition, not really for teaching reform, and reform is just a formality.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure7is a multiple-choice question that investigates the purpose of using information technology for teaching and learning among 73 teachers.

However, in the process of implementing information technology teaching, the number of people who thought it could \"promote students' inquiry learning\" and \"promote collaborative group learning\" was less than 35 people, indicating that teachers did not consider \"cooperative learning\" and \"collaborative learning\" when implementing information technology teaching. This means that teachers do not take into account theories of \"cooperative learning\" and \"inquiry learning\" when implementing information technology teaching, so the effect of information technology teaching will be reduced and the quality of students' information technology learning will not be guaranteed.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure8shows a survey of 73 teachers' opinions on the use of information technology in classroom teaching and learning, which is a multiple-choice question.

The survey shows that 83.66% of students, or 476 students, have installed learning software, but 16.34% of students still have not installed learning software. The installation of learning software facilitates teaching, learning, feedback, and answering questions in many ways. The fact that students do not install them means that teachers and school administrators do not have a policy or guidance for students to effectively use information technology for learning. Therefore, I believe that at the school management level and at the level of student education, measures should be taken to allow students to use all information technology tools to learn, rather than all information technology tools just for competition.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFigure13shows a survey of 569 students on online learning to get answers.

ConclusionManagement informatization, as an effective means to deepen management reform and improve the governance ability of universities, brings opportunities and challenges for the high-quality development of universities. However, we clearly realize that there are still many constraints that need to be solved. Management informatization in higher education is a long and complicated systematic construction project, which requires continuous research and exploration. Based on the theories of university management informatization, new public management, and digital governance, this paper starts from the current situation of universities, identifies the problems that restrict their development, then analyzes the cause-effect relationship of those problems, and finally proposes the solution countermeasures, which provides a case worthy of reference and discussion for the development of university management informatization.This paper mainly forms the following conclusions for the promotion of the management informatization process in colleges and universities:(1)Management informatization should strengthen the top-level design.

Management informatization faces many serious challenges in colleges and universities, such as systemic, sustainability, and complexity, and must be planned for the overall situation and in the long term in order to continuously promote healthy and sustainable development.(2)Management informatization needs users' participation in construction. Only by understanding the needs of teachers and students and strengthening multiparty public governance can we grasp the direction of system construction and development and realize the modernization of university governance capacity.(3)Managers should establish the awareness of management informatization and service consciousness, break the thought of \"emphasizing technology but not management,\" fine management, and active service, and realize the \"one network for all\" of university education management system by building a one-stop service hall.(4)To establish a supervision and evaluation mechanism with the participation of many parties and common construction and governance, as well as an evaluation index system for the development of management informationization.

"AbstractWith the development of the social economy and the acceleration of economic globalization, human resources of enterprises have become an important factor restricting the development of enterprises. This paper creates an enterprise human resource management platform application based on twin network and mobile edge computing. By allocating computing and storage resources to the network edge close to users or data sources, mobile edge computing supports mobile to complete the computing offload of wireless access network applications. This process significantly reduces the end-to-end delay of the network and effectively reduces the processing load of the core network and data center. The simulation results can see that the average user benefit of all algorithms increases with the increase of network transmission speed and VCPU processing power. In addition to the introduction and popularization of information technology, the construction of enterprise human resources informatization also requires continuous and comprehensive monitoring and analysis of existing internal data, information, and data. The use of network communication technology to build a management information system, through information management, can significantly optimize and improve the efficiency of enterprise human resource management.1.

"optimize and improve the efficiency of enterprise human resource management.1. IntroductionThe research object of this paper is a relatively large enterprise group. In recent years, the number and scale of enterprise subsidiaries have increased year by year; enterprise personnel have gradually increased; and there are more daily management work, which makes the management more difficult, and the problems have increased. The first is the poor interoperability of personnel information and data between the head office and its subsidiaries. The second is the high personnel cost, large investment in personnel departments, and low efficiency. Combined with the above aspects, the enterprise human resource management platform investigated in this paper is based on the enterprise human resource management needs and the design ideas and application conditions of the application of the existing domestic human resource management platform [1]. In this paper, we will consider the structure of an enterprise human resource management platform based on a twin network, which is system engineering with a large project investment. Moving edge computing, a relatively mature computing technology at home and abroad, is also used to ensure the progress and integrity of the design. Task scheduling and resource management are two key factors to be considered in the decision-making process of MEC unloading.

"progress and integrity of the design. Task scheduling and resource management are two key factors to be considered in the decision-making process of MEC unloading. On the one hand, the MEC environment is essentially a decentralized heterogeneous parallel computing environment. Only by properly planning tasks can we make full use of the performance advantages of the computing environment. When considering the dynamic changes in the network environment, you should also make planning decisions about when to uninstall tasks. On the other hand, the resources at the edge of the network are limited, so we should appropriately allocate the full potential of these resources so that they can give full play to their greatest advantages and improve their efficiency as much as possible. When there are a large number of users, you should also decide whether to allow them to uninstall (i.e., make permission decisions) to avoid excessive resource contention. In this context, this paper focuses on graph-oriented task unloading planning, dynamic task unloading planning for complex task queues, and access decision and resource allocation considering user mobility from the perspective of users; considers the impact of various application unloading models in static and dynamic environments; and considers optimizing MEC computing unloading planning and resource management strategy to ensure the stable and continuous operation of the group management platform, so as to protect the existing"

This design also considers the development trend of existing technology so that the enterprise's human resources platform can adapt to future technological development and changes and better solve the technical problems caused by the upgrading of the enterprise's human resources platform. In the process of realizing the enterprise human resources management platform to meet the relevant business needs of the enterprise human resources department to the greatest extent, the main principle of the platform is practicality, and the main goal of the platform construction is to find and timely deal with the problems related to personnel and human resources management.Some research introduces an algorithm for predicting the appearance characteristics of moving targets. The algorithm uses memory-enhanced convolution long- and short-term memory networks to predict the changes in the appearance characteristics of targets and estimate the appearance characteristics of future targets.

The tracker uses occlusion simulation to improve training and manage historical information to model the long sequence of dynamically changing targets and reliably predict the characteristics of the next frame [2]. This paper introduces the combination of kernel density feature map and edge detection algorithm, automatically generates ternary map to extract target contour information, and regenerates the tracking results according to the contour boundary. The literature introduces the use and application of personnel management platforms. The robust twin network tracking algorithm is introduced in the literature, which solves the problems of target scaling in the tracking process and makes the tracking algorithm more robust [3]. The literature introduces the generated image kernel density response diagram, which displays the weight of each pixel in the image.2.

Target Positioning Realization FrameworkIn most cases, the target will not be deformed in actual tracking, so the process of combining the tracking algorithm with the target appearance prediction can sufficiently reduce the appearance prediction part of the target. This section proposes a dual neural network tracking algorithm that will determine the deformation of the target and predict the appearance of the target. The specific framework is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAmong them, the tracking part is based on the algorithm structure of SiamRPN++; the input is the original target template andt+ 1 image; and the output of the tracking part is the detection frame information and the pattern similarity value [4].

At the same time, an external memory is needed to store the target images captured fromt-ntot, and input them into ConvLSTM as the preorder sequence for predicting the appearance of the target [5]. Finally, the predicted target feature is retrieved as an auxiliary template and re-entered into the twin network to calculate the new tracking result.2.1.3. Research on Robust Optimization of Target Tracking AlgorithmTaking into account the various environmental interference factors encountered in the process of target positioning, this section combines the tracking displacement, target feature prediction, and tracking frame generation optimization methods proposed in this section to propose a robust tracking algorithm based on dual neural networks [6]. The algorithm shown in Figure2is divided into three main parts: the tracking part, the mixed decision part, and the tracking frame optimization part. This algorithm solves the inaccurate tracking performance of the traditional twin network tracking algorithm due to video jitter, blur, occlusion, fast movement, deformation, overscaling, and so on. from"
