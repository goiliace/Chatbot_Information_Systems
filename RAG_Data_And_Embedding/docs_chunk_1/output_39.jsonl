Information System Selection MethodRelief algorithm was first proposed by Kara, aiming at two classification problems, and its theoretical basis is as follows: a good feature should make the similar sample of the nearest neighbour characteristic values between the same or similar, and the nearest neighbour value differences between the different classes of samples or difference are very big, therefore giving each feature corresponding weights for sorting; the greater the weight of characteristic, the stronger the feature classification ability; on the contrary, the feature classification ability is weak. By setting the feature weight threshold or the number of feature subsets, the corresponding feature selection can be carried out, and the feature can be evaluated according to the feature's ability to distinguish the close samples. The main idea behind Relief's algorithm is that good features should keep samples of the same class close and samples of different classes away. Assume that the interval is defined as the maximum distance that the decision surface can move without changing the sample classification, which can be expressed as(1)whereYxmeans similar toxandhxwithxmeans nonhomogeneous nearest neighbour.The weight of the update attributePof sampleXcan be expressed as(2)Koromiko extended the Relief algorithm"

When dealing with multiclass problems, the Relief algorithm does not uniformly select the nearest neighbour samples from all sample sets of different classes but selects the nearest neighbour samples from each sample set of different classes and selectsknearest neighbour samples. The weight update formula is(3)Artificial Fish Swarms Algorithm is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on fish swarm behaviour proposed by domestic scholars Ian Jixi and Li Xiao lei et al. According to the bionic characteristics of fish swarm, it simulates foraging, clustering, and tailgating behaviours of fish swarm by constructing artificial fish [18], so as to realize optimization. Artificial fish include the following behaviours. Foraging behaviour: assume that the current state of the artificial fish isXi, and select a statexwithin its field of vision at random.

Intelligent Triage Disease Grading FactorsPatients with acute and critical illness are mainly aged, and by referring to the previous data of researchers, three levels of proportions are summarized, among which patients with grade over 60 years old account for 58.45% of the total number of patients, and patients with grade A only account for 41.55%. It can be seen that the elderly population is typical potential acute patients, and the elderly patients with grade A are the focus group in the dynamic triage process.The correlation of blood pressure indexes in patients with II grade critical illness was gradually enhanced with the increase of blood pressure, suggesting that blood pressure was of great significance in the recognition of the disease in patients with the normal grade, while there was no significant correlation in patients with the mild or moderate grade. The possible reasons for the correlation were as follows: III grade acute patients with more acute symptoms, but the vital signs are stable, although there is a risk of deterioration, but there is no risk of life-threatening or disability, so the abnormal blood pressure exposure is not obvious; IV grade nonemergency patients mostly have no acute symptoms, and almost no exposure to abnormal blood pressure, or after brief exposure, it can be relieved and disappear after rest.Breathing and blood oxygen"
"blood pressure exposure is not obvious; IV grade nonemergency patients mostly have no acute symptoms, and almost no exposure to abnormal blood pressure, or after brief exposure, it can be relieved and disappear after rest.Breathing and blood oxygen saturation index reaction is a more sensitive index for the human body, breathing >20 times/min, the total number of I∼III levels accounted for 89%, and 60.98% were III level; therefore the postoperative respiratory management of critically ill patients directly affects the survival and quality of patients, which is acute and potentially dangerous. Paying close attention to changes in breathing is important for early recognition and correct treatment.On the basis of preliminary construction of emergency patients nursing difficulty evaluation index system, the results summed up four categories of influencing factors: patient factor, nurse factor, organizational factor, and nursing equipment condition factor. Among the patient factors, 7 factors were extracted, including age, severity of disease, self-care ability, mental and psychological status, social support system, compliance, and expectation [19].Patient expectation refers to the degree to which patients place their expectations and wishes on medical institutions before treatment, which is mainly reflected in treatment effect, treatment cost, medical service quality, length of hospital stay, and pain in the process of diagnosis and treatment. The influencing factors include"
"and wishes on medical institutions before treatment, which is mainly reflected in treatment effect, treatment cost, medical service quality, length of hospital stay, and pain in the process of diagnosis and treatment. The influencing factors include individual needs of patients, commitment of medical institutions, medical experience of patients, and severity of diseases [20]. The first-level indicators are broken down as follows: the general condition of patients covers the age and complications of patients. Severity of disease in emergency patients, self-care ability: according to the industry recommended standard published by the National Health and Family Planning Commission Barthes Index Evaluation Table, the evaluation can be divided into four grades, which are, respectively, heavy dependence, moderate dependence, mild dependence, and complete self-care. Mental health status: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a self-rating scale [21], including 2 subscales of anxiety and depression, respectively, for 7 questions of anxiety (A) and depression (D). 0-7 are asymptomatic; 8-10 are suspicious. 11∼21 categories definitely have anxiety. Social and economic status: social and economic status is mainly evaluated by three indicators: social support, economic income, and education level.

Compliance: observe the patient's compliance to treatment, nursing, and examination and comprehensively evaluate the patient's overall compliance by asking the patient's doctor in charge and the responsible nurse, which can be divided into five grades: very cooperative, cooperative, basic cooperative, noncooperative, and very noncooperative.4.3. Test Process and ResultsIn the completion of the design and coding of intelligent nursing information system, in order to ensure that the software shows fatal functional errors, improve the reliability and efficiency of the implementation of the software. Software validation is required according to software functional requirements. When testing the software, make sure you can deploy the appropriate operating system to the business server and install the basic operation profile and execution file.In this paper, 20 emergency patients were randomly selected and 5 outstanding nursing staff were selected to complete the basic operation, statistical function, and operational function tests of the software functional modules, and the test results of the functional modules were collected and recorded.

ConclusionIn this paper, an intelligent information zed nursing system is constructed to realize the information sharing in the whole domain, and intelligent auxiliary diagnosis and treatment information is provided to facilitate nursing inquiries of diagnosis and treatment information, which is of great help to patients' follow-up medical activities such as condition analysis, medical history grasp and supplement, and disease diagnosis. The data information stored completely through barcode intelligent information makes it more convenient for medical staff to collect cases and carry out nursing management. At the same time, nursing management online and bar code information collection, without manual transcription and triage, make nursing management faster, more accurate, and more reliable. This shortens the time for emergency nurses to complete the special care record form and effectively reduces the workload of medical staff. It maximizes the integration and utilization of quality-related information through emergency care terminal services.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.Open"

"AbstractOrganizations make use of important information in day-to-day business. Protecting sensitive information is imperative and must be managed. Companies in many parts of the world protect sensitive information using the international standard known as the information security management system (ISMS). ISO 27000 series is the international standard ISMS used to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. While an ISMS based on ISO 27000 series has no particular flaws for general information systems, it is unfit to manage sensitive information for industrial control systems (ICSs) because the first priority of industrial control is safety of the system. Therefore, a new information security management system based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability as well as safety is required for ICSs. This new ISMS must be mutually exclusive of an ICS. This paper provides a new paradigm of ISMS for ICSs, which will be shown to be more suitable than the existing ISMS.1. IntroductionIn general information systems, almost all security groups use the international information security management system (ISMS) standard which is ISO 27000 series. ISO 27000 series focuses on protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information [1-3].

"integrity, and availability of information [1-3]. This ISMS is appropriate for general information systems, where the main threats are dynamic and variable, like malicious hacking.However, industrial control systems (ICSs) are different from general information systems. While protection from dynamic, variable threats is important on an ICS, safety is most crucial in industrial control [4-6].When national infrastructures, like nuclear power plants, deploy an ICS, the ICS is evaluated on the basis of safety [7]. In the field, safety is evaluated by IEC 61508 and IEC 61511. IEC 61508 is the international standard for Functional Safety of Electrical-Electronic-Programmable Electronic Safety-Related Systems and IEC 61511 is the technical standard that defines practices in the engineering of systems that ensures safety of an industrial process (see Figure1).Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between IEC 61508 and IEC 61511.ISMS is based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and the security needs of ICS are not mutually exclusive because the nature of such businesses is different from general information systems. ICS is of significance in the control of national infrastructures. These systems have unquestionable value, and they must be safe [7,8]. For this reason, ICSs require safety first, rather than other ISMS based attributes.

In the field, process owners for ICSs in fact follow the safety standards IEC 61508 and IEC 61511.In short, it should be configured to a new ISMS based on views of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as safety (see Figure2).Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe goal of new information security management system for industrial control system.The ISMS is framework which has presented three views which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability to protect information [1]. However, this paper casts doubt on sufficiency for the three views of existing ISMS to protect assets from internal and external threats and vulnerabilities in ICS.In case of ICS, social impact due to threats and vulnerabilities like hacking, natural disaster, and internal problems for system cannot compare with general information systems and has great damage that brings out severe economic and social dislocation [4,5,8]. Thus, safety becomes the main keyword in ICS.The requirements of IEC 61511 are based on safety, whereas the requirements and controls of ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 are based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability [7]. When it comes to the safety in ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, it is just a part of availability, so the safety of IEC 61511 is different from the safety of NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001.As a result, this paper suggests"
"integrity, and availability [7]. When it comes to the safety in ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, it is just a part of availability, so the safety of IEC 61511 is different from the safety of NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001.As a result, this paper suggests that safety presented IEC 61511 should be considered as a part of new ISMS with confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The reason is that information in ICSs could be exposed, leaked, or tweaked if internal safety for system is not guaranteed for unexpected environmental changes like fluctuation of temperature and humidity in ICSs and absence of safety from external threats and vulnerabilities like hacking and natural disaster have a great ripple effect socioeconomically [8,9].Therefore, safety should be acknowledged as essential value in ISMS of equal level with confidentiality, integrity, and availability in ICS.In order to prove this point, we will compare and analyze security controls or requirements of three international standards, namely, ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, and IEC 61511. If the safety requirements of IEC 61511, which is followed by people in the ICS field, barely match the security controls that include 21 requirements of ISO 27001, or the security controls of NIST SP 800-53, the ISMS for ICSs, in its present form, is faulty and ineffective [1,10,11].This paper will also compare and analyze common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 that were successfully carried out by the South Korea energy group"
"controls of NIST SP 800-53, the ISMS for ICSs, in its present form, is faulty and ineffective [1,10,11].This paper will also compare and analyze common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 that were successfully carried out by the South Korea energy group (thermal, gas, nuclear, combined cycle, electricity, and power exchange) using safety requirements of IEC 61511. The reason for using common security controls to compare with requirements of IEC 61511 is that common security controls are sufficient for every ICS, regardless of the specific application. For these reasons, comparing common security controls and safety requirements of IEC 61511 is essential to further generalize this for every ICS. If the result of matching is the same with the above result of comparison for safety requirements of IEC 61511, security controls of ISO 27001, and security controls of NIST Special Publication 800-53, this analysis can also prove that the ISMS is presently faulty and ineffective in a general ICS environment. In other words, the ISMS that focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information based on ISO 27000 series is unfit to manage sensitive information on an ICS.2.

The first chapter is called \"framework, definitions, system, hardware and software requirements\"; the second chapter is called \"guidelines for the application of IEC 61511-1\"; and the third chapter is called \"guidance for the determination of the required safety integrity levels.\" The safety requirements of IEC 61511 are divided into five safety parts and the safety parts consist of development, allocation, design, installation, commissioning, validation, operation, modification, and decommissioning for an ICS. The safety requirements of IEC 61511 are composed of 15 domains and the total number of controls is 215 pieces. The domain for requirements and overall framework of IEC 61511 are shown in Figures5and6[7].Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDomains for safety requirements of IEC 61511.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall framework of IEC 61511.3.

"of International StandardsEach part of IEC 61511 has several requirements that include the security controls of NIST SP 800-53 or the security controls of ISO 27001.In order to prove this point, we compare and analyze the security controls/requirements of three international standards, namely ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, and IEC 61511, below.3.1. Preparation of Matching Analysis for Security Controls and Requirements of International StandardsWe present a comparative security controls list for IEC 61511, ISO 27001, and NIST SP 800-53. The example for list up is presented in Table1[1,7].Table  1.The example of security controls list up for international standard.Domain numberIEC 61511Domain numberISO 270015.2.2.1Persons, departments, organizations, or other units which are responsible for carrying out and reviewing each of the safety life-cycle phases shall be identified and be informed of the responsibilities assigned to them (including, where relevant, licensing authorities or safety regulatory bodies).A.6.1.1All information security responsibilities shall be defined and allocated.3.2. Result of Matching Analysis for Security Controls and Requirements of International StandardsIn order to find out whether security controls for international standards match, we compare the requirements of IEC 61511 with security controls of NIST SP 800-53 and security controls of ISO 27001.There are two results based on this comparison.

"international standards match, we compare the requirements of IEC 61511 with security controls of NIST SP 800-53 and security controls of ISO 27001.There are two results based on this comparison. Firstly, the percentage of matching security controls of ISO 27001 with safety requirements of IEC 61511 is 15%. Specifically, the total number of security controls for ISO 27001 is 140 pieces and 21 pieces of these matched with safety requirements of IEC 61511.Secondly, the percentage of matching security controls for NIST SP 800-53 with safety requirements of IEC 61511 is 16.49%. Specifically, the total number of security controls of NIST SP 800-53 is 194 pieces and 34 pieces of these matched with safety requirements of IEC 61511.In short, the percentage of matching requirements of IEC 61511, with both security controls of NIST SP 800-53 and security controls of ISO 27001, is quite low. These results mean that ISMS based on ISO 27001 or NIST SP 800-53 is insufficient for a real industrial control system's environment because the ISMS does not reflect specificity for the nature of ICS. The specificity is safety, which is a core value on the IEC 61511 (see Table2and Figure7).Table  2.The matching analysis for requirements or security controls of international standards.Comparison targetsISO 27001NIST SP 800-53The total number of security controls and requirements140(requirements: 21, security controls: 114)194The total number of matching security controls for comparison target with"

Extracting Items from IEC 61511 to Append New ISMSThe extracting items from IEC 61511 to append new ISMS are selected by certain conditions as follows. The first step is to choose nonmatching requirements of all for IEC 61511 with requirements and controls for NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001. The next step is to choose general requirements in each ICS life-cycle types of the nonmatching requirements for IEC 61511 with requirements and controls of NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001 and the general requirements are the extracting items. The reason to select general requirements of nonmatching requirements is to maintain a level of requirements and controls with ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 and assure safety for new ISMS [12,13].The recommended extracting items of safety from IEC 61511 to develop new ISMS are shown in Table3.Table  3.The example of recommended extracting items from IEC 61511.Recommended extracting itemsIEC 61511The safety requirements shall be derived from the allocation of safety"

"and, where necessary, modifications made such that the required safety is maintained. This shall include monitoring the following:(i) the actions taken following a demand on the system;(ii) the failures of equipment forming part of the SIS established during routine testing or actual demand;(iii) the cause of the demands;(iv) the cause of false trips.The procedures shall include a clear method of identifying and requesting the work to be done and the hazards which may be affected (modification and decommissioning).Modification shall be performed with qualified personnel who have been properly trained. All affected and appropriate personnel should be notified of the change and trained with regard to the change.This paper presents that the safety has two meanings broadly. The first meaning is safety against external factors like hacking and natural disaster; another is safety against internal factors like internal failure for system.The requirements of IEC 61511 and the requirements of ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 do not present direct requirements against internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to hinder safety in ICS. Instead, requirements of IEC 61511 present safety requirements in each ICS life-cycle types that guarantee safety from the internal and external threats and vulnerabilities, and the safety requirements aim to improve safety for ICS that is core to manage well risk from the internal and external threats and vulnerabilities.4.

Matching Analysis for Common Security Controls of NIST SP 800-53 in South Korea Energy Industry and Safety Requirements of IEC 61511Each part of IEC 61511 has several requirements that include the security controls of NIST SP 800-53. In this section, we will not compare and analyze whole security controls of international standards, but instead we will compare and analyze common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 that were successfully carried out by the South Korea energy group (thermal, gas, nuclear, combined cycle, electricity, and power exchange) with safety requirements of IEC 61511. This is because entire security controls of NIST SP 800-53 do not apply to the South Korea energy group.In order to find out the common security controls from the entire security controls of NIST SP 800-53, we constructed evaluation frame that has security controls of NIST SP 800-53. We asked the South Korea energy group, that is, power exchange, electricity, gas, combined cycle, nuclear, and thermal groups, to fill out a questionnaire [10,11,14] (see Table4).Table  4.The domain and subdomain of NIST SP 800-53 for an ICS.DomainSubdomainD.1 Access ControlD.1.2 Account ManagementD.1.3 Access EnforcementD.1.5 Separation of DutiesD.1.6 Least PrivilegeD.1.7"

"Results of Matching Analysis for Common Security Controls of NIST SP 800-53 in South Korea Energy Groups and Requirements IEC 61511The safety requirements of IEC 61511 match common security controls of NIST SP 800-53. In fact, it may be more difficult to match the safety requirements of IEC 61511 with common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 due to the nature of the standard. The standard generalizes requirements, while the value for common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 compare well enough with the safety requirements of IEC 61511 (see Table6).Table  6.Comparison for common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 and safety requirements of IEC 61511.NumberMain domain nameCode of security control for common security controls in South Korea Energy IndustrySafety requirements of IEC 615111Access controlAC-2〈R.11.7.2.4〉Enabling and disabling the read-write access shall be carried out only by a configuration or programming process using the maintenance/engineering interface with appropriate documentation and security measures.2AC-53AC-64Media protectionMP-2--5MP-3.a6MP-3.b7MP-4.a8MP-4.b9MP-5.a10MP-5.c11Physical and environmental protectionPE-2〈D.11.2.11〉For subsystems that on loss of power do not fail to the safe state, all of the following requirements shall be met and action taken according to 11.3:(i) loss of circuit integrity is detected (for example, end-of-line monitoring);(ii) power supply integrity is ensured using supplemental power supply (for example, battery"

These results mean that ISMS based on ISO 27001 or NIST SP 800-53 is insufficient to make for real ICSs because the ISMS does not reflect specificity of the nature of ICSs (see Figure9).Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparative analysis for controls of international standards.The second methodology involved analysis of matching of the common security controls of NIST SP 800-53 that were successfully carried out by the South Korea energy group (thermal, gas, nuclear, combined cycle, electricity, and power exchange) with the safety requirements of IEC 61511.

This paper proves that safety is very significant for ICSs, and safety should be included in an ISMS based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.In brief, a new ISMS based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability as well as safety is required in ICSs. This new information security management system is mutually exclusive to the nature of industrial control system.We expect that the performance of information security for ICSs will be improved through our work.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by a grant from Korea University.References1International Organization for Standardization, ISO 27001, 2013.Google Scholar2Beckers K.,Goal-based establishment of an information security management system compliant to ISO 27001,Theory and Practice of Computer.

Under this background, this paper selects the research methods of theory guiding practice and practice updating theory to guide the application of information technology. Based on the actual engineering cases, this paper discusses the scientific process of information management construction of construction projects from the perspective of BIM Technology by taking the specific construction details as the starting point. Firstly, this paper systematically introduces the key technologies of BIM and the related concepts and basic contents of construction project management informatization, expounds and analyzes the three construction modes that should be followed by construction project collaborative management informatization, and puts forward the key and main contents of standardization construction.

"as an engineering case, this paper analyzes the application of building information modeling (BIM) in the architectural design of New York freedom building. Relevant research can provide theoretical and practical references for realizing and ensuring the combination of project management and information technology.1. BackgroundIn recent years, in order to accelerate the process of informatization management of construction projects, my country has successively issued the \"Twelfth Five-Year Development Plan for the Construction Industry\" and the \"2011-2015 Outline for the Development of the Construction Industry Informatization,\" both of which clearly pointed out the following: emerging intelligent management tools, such as BIM Technology, Internet of Things technology, 5G mobile communication technology, and 4D smart vision have greatly strengthened the intelligent control and management of engineering construction [1], so it is very necessary to further develop and construct information intelligent management tools. In mid-2016, the Party Central Committee issued the \"2016-2020 Construction Industry Information Development Outline,\" further planning the overall development of the construction industry, which emphasized the importance of information technology such as building information modeling and construction management information systems [2].

"the importance of information technology such as building information modeling and construction management information systems [2]. In addition, the document also pointed out that the current society's construction information management technology is far from reaching the expected goal, and the entire construction industry alone has generated huge technical needs for it, especially construction engineering information management and modern emerging mobile communications. The integration of technology will greatly promote the efficiency of construction engineering information management.\"Internet+\" brings new opportunities to the development of the times and leads all fields into the era of information management. As a leader in the field of construction engineering, project management must adapt to the changes in the new era. In addition, with the rapid development of science and technology, mobile communication technology has also made a qualitative leap [3,4]. As a result, 5G wireless communication technology, which not only covers a wide range but also has high-speed transmission speed, is on the stage, which brings good development opportunities for the development of construction project management information [5]. The analysis of hot topics in domestic and foreign research shows that the life cycle management of construction projects is currently a hot topic in the construction industry.

"analysis of hot topics in domestic and foreign research shows that the life cycle management of construction projects is currently a hot topic in the construction industry. The key to achieving this goal is to establish an information model, which is now called BIM (building information modeling) technology.The monitoring and control of construction progress is a long-term and dynamic development process, which requires the continuous update of on-site data and the generation of a large amount of information. With the continuous development of the construction progress of the project, the progress information of the project will continue to increase dynamically. And some information in the construction process can be used in the later stages of the building, such as the operation and maintenance stage, thereby contributing to the life cycle of the building [6,7].The information generated in the process of building construction monitoring and control is dynamic and real-time development, so it is necessary to keep, share, and manage the information generated in the construction process, so as to facilitate all parties involved in the construction project to obtain the information in a time when the construction project information changes and avoid unnecessary rework due to information errors in the later stage. As a comprehensive and coordinated information database, BIM has incomparable speed and portability in obtaining the required information and realizing information"
"changes and avoid unnecessary rework due to information errors in the later stage. As a comprehensive and coordinated information database, BIM has incomparable speed and portability in obtaining the required information and realizing information sharing [8]. Based on this advantage, the application of BIM Technology in practical engineering projects has become the common expectation of all participants and also promotes all parties to make better use of information for their own adjustment, so as to promote the better realization of construction projects.BIM Technology can be applied to the storage and query of information in the whole life cycle of construction projects. It can effectively sort out and track the transmission and change of construction information from one stage to another, avoiding \"information interruption\" and information loss. Another function of BIM Technology is to reduce information fuzziness and unconformity. The research on BIM by many scholars at home and abroad also fully reflects the feasibility and value of the application measures taken by BIM Technology in the design and implementation of construction projects. Therefore, BIM Technology is widely applied to the dynamic real-time construction monitoring and management system of the construction industry, which can effectively provide excellent solutions for the fields of dynamic monitoring data information integration and analysis of the construction industry and resource sharing.For the"
"monitoring and management system of the construction industry, which can effectively provide excellent solutions for the fields of dynamic monitoring data information integration and analysis of the construction industry and resource sharing.For the practical application value of BIM Technology, this paper will select an engineering example to show the working path of project management. At the same time, in order to promote the technology to comply with the requirements of the development of the times and meet the development needs of modern architecture, it is also necessary to point out the limitations and defects of existing models in the process of practical case application, promote the technology to keep pace with the times, and give full play to the characteristics and advantages of BIM Technology in the practical application of the construction industry. By analyzing the improvement and upgrading of traditional project management by BIM Technology, this paper obtains the advantages of project management based on BIM Technology compared with traditional project management.2. BIM Key Technology and Construction Project Information Construction2.1. BIM Key TechnologyBased on the realization of the 3D building model, BIM Technology realizes the sharing of information generated by the 3D building model among all participating departments of the building.

"Technology realizes the sharing of information generated by the 3D building model among all participating departments of the building. By connecting all stages of the whole construction life cycle of the construction project with each department one by one, it truly realizes the unified application and management of information. For each stage, each department forms a complete, comprehensive interpretation of guidance. All departments of the construction project have access to the same 3D building model, and all the building information is added to the model to facilitate the extraction of the necessary information. Through such analysis, we can know that BIM Technology has the advantages of integrating, managing, and sharing all information in the whole life cycle of buildings. It can not only achieve certain coordination and consistency in the transmission and use of drawings, data, and other information in the profession. More importantly, it can also easily realize the information sharing, extraction, and use of timeliness and accuracy of information in different majors.In order to perfectly realize the functional benefits brought by BIM Technology, it is also necessary to create an information application platform, which can uniformly manage the project construction information of all participants in the project and, based on the information application platform, create an open information model that can exchange and communicate, namely, IFC; thus, a 3D building"
"which can uniformly manage the project construction information of all participants in the project and, based on the information application platform, create an open information model that can exchange and communicate, namely, IFC; thus, a 3D building information exchange application model is established.Tracing the development process of BIM Technology, it can be seen that it originated in the United States, but it has developed rapidly. In just a few years, it has been applied and promoted by many countries, such as Britain, Switzerland and other European countries, Japan, Singapore, and other developed countries. The application of BIM Technology in China started late, and it began to talk about BIM Technology after 2002 at the earliest. He Guanpei, a famous research scholar in China, proposed that since the BIM model is the basis for supporting the whole BIM process, the core of the BIM software also lies in the BIM modeling software (see Figure1).Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBIM software category summary.2.2. Application Value of BIM TechnologyThrough practical application, it can be seen that BIM Technology is more or less applied in different stages of the whole life cycle of construction projects. The following is mainly explained from two aspects: engineering design and project management.2.2.1.

"following is mainly explained from two aspects: engineering design and project management.2.2.1. Intelligent Engineering DesignWhen the collaborative management application of construction projects is realized in the actual project, the designers of the company can make full use of the 3D rendering function of BIM Technology to carry out relevant operations on the mode of construction projects, simulate the actual scene of buildings, and render the documents and images of buildings and scenes through the change of data and mode. When there are changes related to the 3D model, the corresponding files and drawings can be automatically updated. After that, construction management such as joint design can be carried out.2.2.2. Information-Based Project ManagementIn the previous construction project information collaborative management, paper is often used. This paper method is greatly affected by human subjective factors. If there is improper storage or loss in the process of mutual transmission, all kinds of data and information on this paper will be distorted and produce wrong information, which will affect the information of construction projects and the management quality of a large number of data. Therefore, in the information management of construction projects, the use of BIM Technology effectively overcomes the defects existing in the information management of existing construction projects and avoids the problems of confusion or lack of information. On this basis,"
"management of construction projects, the use of BIM Technology effectively overcomes the defects existing in the information management of existing construction projects and avoids the problems of confusion or lack of information. On this basis, participants can also use the information query service function provided by the information management system and database to quickly obtain the necessary construction project data, so as to more efficiently optimize the work efficiency and quality of project data management.2.3. Application Outline of Civil Engineering Information Management TechnologyFirst, construction enterprises should pay attention to the comprehensive application of information technology. There are a lot of manual operations in the management process, which has a certain negative impact on the reliability, integrity, and quality of construction enterprise information.Second, construction engineering enterprises need to constantly absorb experts with professional information management talents and strengthen their own talent management team. At present, the level of hardware equipment of many construction companies has been greatly improved, but the informatization of enterprise internal management is still at a low level. Some new procurement information management software has not been fully developed, so it is necessary to further improve the informatization management level.Third, construction engineering enterprises must pay attention to the phased"
"at a low level. Some new procurement information management software has not been fully developed, so it is necessary to further improve the informatization management level.Third, construction engineering enterprises must pay attention to the phased development process of information management and replan the construction of enterprise information management in the heyday of strategic development. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the system planning process and put forward practical information management solutions according to the current financial situation, personnel, equipment, technical situation, and market situation of the enterprise, so as to reduce the resistance of information management in the application process.3. Construction Enterprise Project Management Information ConstructionIn the whole process of the implementation of construction project management, in order to realize the informatization of construction, we must not only need mature software system products and stable hardware operating environment but also establish a set of the corresponding management system, management framework, and good cultural atmosphere. These are the necessary conditions for the construction industry to implement project management informatization. As shown in Figure2, the basic preparation for project management informatization in the construction industry is mainly carried out in four steps.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointProject information"

As shown in Figure2, the basic preparation for project management informatization in the construction industry is mainly carried out in four steps.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointProject information construction preparation.For the buzzsaw platform, project participants provide leasing services through the approved project management platform, and all participants save project shared information through the central database of the network.

The freedom building is equipped with world-class restaurants, viewing platforms, and the most advanced news broadcasting facilities.

"facilities. In addition, other interior design places of the building adopt the highest level of design technology to achieve the purpose of building safety, sustainability, and quality. The project is of great significance to the United States. Its completion will mark the development of a new generation of buildings. SOM and other companies have established cooperation with Autodesk consulting company to realize the Autodesk Revit architectural information modeling platform, so as to successfully complete this innovative architectural design.The freedom building project in the United States is a complex building with a height of about 450 meters and a rotation of 40 degrees. The building is designed to reduce the wind power of the Hudson River and realize the purpose of dispersing wind power. In other words, the layout of each floor of the building is different. In addition, the broadcast antenna on the top of the freedom building is a steel cable, which plays a role as a wind turbine to generate building power. The design style of the freedom building corresponds to the design style of the Brooklyn Bridge.Any complex design needs to rely on advanced computer technology, because as long as there is a small error, it may cause high cost and construction delay during the construction period. After screening various industry software, SOM selects Autodesk Revit as the priority architecture design tool of the project to realize the seamless integration of the other two"
"may cause high cost and construction delay during the construction period. After screening various industry software, SOM selects Autodesk Revit as the priority architecture design tool of the project to realize the seamless integration of the other two components of the building information modeling platform and generate the proposed structural solution in real time. In the design process, when the model data is updated, all project participants in other fields can display the latest and complete information of the whole project in real time. In addition, the software also facilitates extensive design cooperation. In the original design process, when the designer changes the very complex part, it is often discussed around the design drawing. With the help of the Revit platform, the architect only needs to open the model on the screen and change the area to be adjusted.Taking freedom tower as an example, Autodesk Revit structure software can help architects effectively improve the integrity and coordination of the project in the field of engineering construction. This is because the building information modeling can adjust its own model according to needs, so it can greatly save design time and design change time. Instead of marking the problem in red, the project leader waited a week to obtain the image of the building column in real time.

"of marking the problem in red, the project leader waited a week to obtain the image of the building column in real time. Using Autodesk consulting software, SOM divides the project into five parts: foundation, core structure, around the foundation, around the main tower, and spire. It can be seen that the Revit platform is a technological revolution, which has made outstanding contributions to the construction of freedom building.5. Countermeasures for Information Technology to Improve the Effect of Collaborative Management of Construction Projects5.1. Make Full Use of Big Data Technology to Strengthen the Information Management Awareness of Senior ManagersIn order to improve the effectiveness of collaborative management of construction projects, construction enterprises must make maximum use of big data technology. After nearly 10 years of development, China's construction industry continues to expand, and construction technology and equipment are constantly updated. The application of big data technology to the construction of information in the construction industry can significantly improve the practical application level of project collaborative management.5.2. Make Efficient Use of Cloud Technology to Build a Comprehensive Information Management PlatformFacing the development of modern technology, China's construction industry needs to make maximum use of cloud computing technology, build an information collaborative management platform, and promote the all-round"
"Information Management PlatformFacing the development of modern technology, China's construction industry needs to make maximum use of cloud computing technology, build an information collaborative management platform, and promote the all-round promotion of the information management mode. Construction engineering companies can make full use of this good market environment to build their own companies, promote the development of the company, improve the level of construction technology, and improve the efficiency of management.5.3. Improve the Informatization Management Level of Project ManagersThe engineering company can implement special technical training for information technology implementers, actual operators, and persons in charge of later maintenance. Finally, the construction engineering company forms standardized measurement standards by holding lectures and training, checks the learning achievements of employees, and regularly checks the status of employees using information technology to guide their work.5.4. Make Efficient Use of Mobile Communication Technology to Speed Up the Project Informatization AuditThe engineering construction company should not only further improve the quality level of project information construction and improve the scientific effectiveness of project quality supervision and management but also make full use of wireless communication technology to speed up the audit of project information construction. Because the project management of"
"construction and improve the scientific effectiveness of project quality supervision and management but also make full use of wireless communication technology to speed up the audit of project information construction. Because the project management of a construction enterprise often has obvious timeliness and periodicity, in the progress and development of modern construction enterprises, wireless communication technology can establish an effective wireless communication conveyor belt for the financial management, design department, construction management, human resources, and management of the whole construction enterprise. With this frequent communication from the construction site and project management process, effective communication with the project manager can be effectively improved. The wide application of mobile communication technology will greatly change the specific operation and management mode of construction engineering enterprises. Through the research and development of wireless communication technology, architectural designers can transfer the special conditions of the construction site under certain conditions to the actual application design drawings of construction engineering construction in real time. In addition to the above means, construction engineering enterprises can also use the development of remote control technology and remote supervision technology to strengthen the effective supervision and management of construction sites.To sum up, the"
"In addition to the above means, construction engineering enterprises can also use the development of remote control technology and remote supervision technology to strengthen the effective supervision and management of construction sites.To sum up, the use of information management technology can reduce the waste of resources in construction project management and improve the integrity of management. From the analysis of this paper, it can be seen that the research on the application of informatization in construction engineering management will help construction engineering enterprises to see the shortcomings in the current enterprise engineering management process from the perspective of problems and upgrade the management scheme pertinently. Therefore, construction enterprises should pay more attention to information technology and explore countermeasures to improve the effectiveness of management in management practice.6. ConclusionModern construction projects are gradually driven in the direction of complexity and large scale. The complex building structure has brought unprecedented challenges to the engineering construction management industry. The traditional project management model can no longer meet today's complex project management needs. Therefore, BIM Technology appears in people's vision without solving the problems.

"complex project management needs. Therefore, BIM Technology appears in people's vision without solving the problems. BIM Technology uses the latest information collection, processing, analysis, and sharing technology to integrate a large number of complex engineering information into a unified work platform according to the unified IFC standard. All relevant personnel related to the project can retrieve and query data and information related to the project. Therefore, BIM Technology provides a rapid and convenient communication method for all participants in engineering construction. At the same time, it ensures the real-time update of project information and the synchronization of information of all relevant personnel after information change.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Open ResearchData AvailabilityData sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.References1Wang J.,Tang J.,Xu Z.,Wang Y.,Xue G.,Zhang X., andYang D.,Spatiotemporal modeling and prediction in cellular networks: a big data enabled deep learning approach,IEEE INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications, May 2017, Atlanta, GA, USA,1-9,https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057090, 2-s2.0-85034052310.10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057090Google Scholar2Ai B.,Guan K.,Rupp M.,Kurner T.,Cheng X.,Yin X.

"AbstractAimsThe South Korean government implemented the narcotics information management system (NIMS) on 18 May 2018 to manage benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and narcotics effectively and establish a reporting mechanism for these drugs. This study assessed the effects of NIMS on inappropriate use of BzRAs.MethodsUsing national patient sample data from 2016 to 2020, we analysed adult outpatients who were prescribed oral BzRAs. We conducted a time series and segmented regression analysis using selected indicators to analyse the monthly variations related to the inappropriate use of these medications.ResultsThe study revealed no significant changes in the indicators of inappropriate BzRA use following the NIMS implementation. Contrary to expectations, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients exceeding defined daily dose (DDD) and in those receiving concurrent prescriptions of multiple BzRAs, following the implementation of NIMS. The immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was an increase in DDD exceedance; however, overall, this did not significantly affect BzRA use.ConclusionsThe introduction of NIMS did not significantly enhance the management of BzRA misuse. Additional measures, including continuous monitoring, system improvements and comprehensive education for prescribers and patients, are recommended to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications.What is already known about this subjectThe narcotics information management"
"continuous monitoring, system improvements and comprehensive education for prescribers and patients, are recommended to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications.What is already known about this subjectThe narcotics information management system (NIMS) was implemented in South Korea to enhance the management of controlled drugs, including benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs), by establishing a reporting mechanism for these drugs.Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are widely used for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and the side effects of other medications but carry risks of misuse, dependence and side effects, particularly with prolonged use.What this study addsDespite the implementation of NIMS, there was no significant reduction in inappropriate use of BzRAs. There was even a significant increase in the proportion of patients exceeding defined daily doses (DDD) and those receiving concurrent prescriptions of multiple BzRAs.The study suggests that while NIMS has improved transparency in the reporting of BzRA prescriptions, it has not sufficiently impacted prescribing behaviours to reduce misuse. This indicates a need for additional measures, such as continuous monitoring system improvements, comprehensive education for prescribers and patients, and the establishment of controlled substance stewardship programmes, to ensure the appropriate use of BzRAs.1 INTRODUCTIONBenzodiazepines (BZDs), originally developed in the 1960, have been widely used worldwide to"
"education for prescribers and patients, and the establishment of controlled substance stewardship programmes, to ensure the appropriate use of BzRAs.1 INTRODUCTIONBenzodiazepines (BZDs), originally developed in the 1960, have been widely used worldwide to treat anxiety and sleep disorders.1They are also effective in reducing the side effects of antipsychotic drugs, alleviating withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent patients and providing relief from muscle tension.2,3In the 1990s, a new class of drugs known as Z-drugs emerged. While structurally distinct from BZDs, they function as benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) like BZDs. Notable examples within this category includezolpidem,eszopicloneandzaleplon, all of which have been approved for the treatment of insomnia. These medications are favoured because of their shorter duration of action and minimal residual effects during waking hours, making them widely used for short-term insomnia management.4While short-term use of BzRAs is effective for symptoms like anxiety, insomnia and alcohol withdrawal, prolonged or excessive use can have both psychological and physical side effects.5Risks include tolerance and high dependency, and severe withdrawal symptoms such as rebound anxiety, seizures, muscle pain and hallucinations.5Long-term use has been associated with an increased prevalence of conditions such as substance abuse and mood disorders, accidents and cognitive impairment.6-9The prescription of BzRAs, especially in"
"anxiety, seizures, muscle pain and hallucinations.5Long-term use has been associated with an increased prevalence of conditions such as substance abuse and mood disorders, accidents and cognitive impairment.6-9The prescription of BzRAs, especially in older adults, requires special caution. The Beers criteria recommend cautious use of these medications in older patients because of an increased risk of falls and fractures associated with prolonged sedation.10Even when deemed necessary, long-acting BZDs are generally discouraged, and short-acting agents should be prescribed carefully and for a limited duration.10,11Despite the risks, the use of BzRAs has been on the rise. A 2015 and 2016 survey reported that 12.5% of adults in the United States had used BZDs.12In South Korea, the prescription volume of zolpidem increased significantly from 2002 to 2013.13Most BzRAs are regulated in South Korea as controlled drugs alongside narcotics.14In response to rising misuse, the South Korean government implemented the narcotics information management system (NIMS) on 18 May 2018. This healthcare information technology system was established to ensure rigorous control of medical narcotics and controlled drugs.15It mandates the reporting of all activities related to the manufacture, import, distribution, usage, transfer, receipt and disposal of narcotics to the Commissioner of the Korea Food and Drug Administration through the NIMS.16This study aimed to investigate changes in the"

The dataset, based on healthcare reimbursement claims, is provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment service of South Korea.17South Korea's unique healthcare system encompasses a single national health insurance covering the entire population, making this dataset an invaluable resource for healthcare research and policy development. It offers a comprehensive view of the country's healthcare environment, including de-identified patient information such as age, sex, diagnoses and medical facility details.18For our analysis, the dataset from 2016 to 2018 represented 3% of the population, while the 2019 and 2020 data represented 2%.182.2 Study designInterrupted time-series (ITS) analysis was employed to assess the impact of NIMS on the inappropriate use of oral BzRAs.

We examined the changes in monthly indicators over a 5-year period from 2016 to 2020, before and after implementation of the NIMS on 18 May 2018. This study also considered the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in February 2020, as an additional intervention point for the analysis.192.3 Study populationPatients aged 20 or older who received at least one prescription of oral BzRAs in outpatient settings from 2016 to 2020 were included. These patients were categorized by sex, age group (20-44, 45-64, 65-74 and 75 years and older), and insurance type (National Health Insurance (NHI) and Medical Aid/Patriots & Veterans Insurance [MedAid/PVI]). The percentage of patients with concurrent conditions was also analysed using the Korean Classification of Diseases-7 codes (KCD-7 codes; a Korean modified version of the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision).2.4 Study drugsOur analysis focused on the oral BzRAs listed under the South Korean National Health Insurance. These drugs are classified by the World Health Organization Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (WHO ATC) codes as anti-anxiety drugs (N05BA), sleep sedatives (N05CD, N05CF), and anti-convulsants (N03AE).20BZDs were divided into short-acting BZDs (half-life <24 h), and long-acting BZDs (half-life >24 h).21The specific drugs analysed are detailed in TableS1.2.5 Outcome measuresThis"

"the proportion of these patients in the study population as follows:2.5.3 Proportion of older patients prescribed long-acting BZDsConsidering the increased sensitivity and risk of withdrawal symptoms among older adults, short-acting BZDs are generally recommended over long-acting ones.23To assess prescribing patterns for this demographic, we calculated the monthly percentage of patients aged 65 and older who were prescribed long-acting BZDs. This measure helps to evaluate adherence to geriatric prescription guidelines and the potential risks associated with long-acting BZD use in older patients.2.5.4 Proportion of patients prescribed BzRAs and opioid analgesics concurrentlyConcurrent prescription of BzRAs and narcotic analgesics is not recommended because of the increased risk of sedation, respiratory depression and unconsciousness, among other potential dangers. In 2016, the USA FDA issued safety warnings and safety communications cautioning against the concurrent use of BZDs or central nervous system depressants with narcotic analgesics, citing the risk of respiratory distress or even death.24Accordingly, we analysed the percentage of patients receiving both drug types in a single prescription each month:2.5.5 Proportion of patients prescribed multiple BzRAs concurrentlyThe concurrent prescription of multiple BzRAs can significantly increase the risk of adverse effects.

The Korea Food and Drug Administration recommends prescribing only one item per prescription whenever possible.22We calculated the percentage of patients receiving two or more different BzRAs within a single prescription each month:2.6 Statistical analysisInitially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis of all variables to establish a baseline understanding of the dataset. Subsequently, to analyse the impact of NIMS implementation on oral BzRA prescriptions, we conducted an ITS analysis with segmented regression.25We also investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the study period. To this end, we used two intervention points: one in May 2018 and the other in February 2020. Consequently, the ITS analysis in this study was divided into three segments: the pre-NIMS implementation period, from January 2016 to April 2018 (28 months); the period after NIMS implementation until just before the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 2018 to January 2020 (21 months); and the period starting from February 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, to the end of the study period in December 2020 (10 months).The model is as follows:whereYtrepresents the value of the outcome variable for montht, andtimetis a continuous variable indicating the number of months from the start of the observation period to montht.

"Veterans Insurance.Throughout the study period, a higher number of female patients than male patients received the study drug. The largest group in terms of prescriptions was patients aged 45-64, indicating this age group's significant engagement with the healthcare system for these medications. Most patients were covered by the NHI, outnumbering those treated with MedAid/PVI. A gradual but noticeable increase was observed in the proportion of MedAid/PVI recipients over time, suggesting a shift in healthcare utilization patterns.Gastrointestinal disorders, notably gastric ulcers, gastritis and duodenitis, were the most common comorbidities among the study patients, followed by psychiatric disorders and hypertension.More than 80% of the study patients were initially prescribed BZDs. However, as the study progressed, particularly in the latter part of the study period, there was a marked decline in BZD prescriptions with a corresponding increase in Z-drug prescriptions.3.2 Inappropriate use of oral BzRAsThe segmented regression analysis of the inappropriate use of BzRAs is presented in Table2and Figure1.TABLE  2.Results of the segmented regression analysis of inappropriate use of oral benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs).OutcomeEstimatorCoefficientP-valueD-WPatients exceeding DDD (%)ARIntercept (β0)0.9235<.00012.0169Baseline trend (β1)−0.0023.0442Level change after NIMS (β2)0.0467.0897Trend change after NIMS (β3)0.0084.0008Level change after COVID-19 (β4)0.1120.0100Trend"

"prescribed BzRAs over 30 daysOur analysis revealed a non-significant decrease in the proportion of patients with prescription durations exceeding 30 days prior to NIMS implementation (β1= −0.0051%,P= .6460). This trend continued with a further, albeit non-significant, decrease post-NIMS (β3= −0.0104%,P= .5890). The COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have increased both the level and trend of longer prescription durations; however, these changes were not statistically significant.3.2.3 Proportion of older patients prescribed long-acting BZDBefore NIMS, there was a significant decrease in older patients prescribed long-acting BZD (β1= −0.1383%,P< .001). Post-NIMS, this trend initially increased (β2= 0.8184%,P= .1330), then showed a non-significant decrease (β3= 0.0549%,P= .2210). The post-COVID-19 period saw a mild non-significant increase (β5= 0.0712%,P= .4940).3.2.4 Proportion of patients prescribed BzRAs and opioid analgesics concurrentlyA significant increasing trend was noted pre-NIMS (β1= 0.0017%,P= .0153), which persisted post-NIMS (β3= 0.0001%,P= .9275).

"BzRAs concurrentlyThere was a significant increase in patients prescribed multiple BzRAs before NIMS (β1= 0.0161%,P= .0126), which became steeper post-NIMS (β3increased by 0.0313%,P= .0208). Post-COVID-19, this trend showed a nonsignificant weakening.4 DISCUSSIONThis study assessed the influence of NIMS on the use of oral BzRAs through an analysis of national claims data. Over the 32 months following NIMS implementation, no significant improvements in the key indicators related to BzRA misuse were found. Contrary to expectations, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients exceeding the DDD and in those receiving concurrent prescriptions of multiple BzRAs following the implementation of NIMS. This suggests that the reported increase in usage following NIMS implementation may be attributed to the enforced reporting of prescriptions rather than to an actual increase in usage at that time.Our findings suggest that the NIMS mandatory reporting requirements and associated penalties for non-compliance may not be sufficient to curb inappropriate BzRA use. By contrast, systems such as prescription drug monitoring programmes (PDMPs) in the USA and the Narcotics Monitoring System (NMS) in Canada, which provide real-time access to prescription histories, appear to be more effective. While sharing a common goal with NIMS of monitoring controlled substances to prevent misuse and abuse,28these systems differ significantly in their operational mechanisms. The real-time"
"access to prescription histories, appear to be more effective. While sharing a common goal with NIMS of monitoring controlled substances to prevent misuse and abuse,28these systems differ significantly in their operational mechanisms. The real-time access feature of PDMPs and NMS is crucial for identifying potential prescription misuse, a capability that NIMS lacks.29Studies have shown that PDMPs and NMS can significantly reduce narcotic drug prescriptions and opioid misuse.30-32Another approach to preventing the inappropriate use of BzRAs is through stewardship programmes. Currently, there is an active discussion of opioid stewardship programmes or controlled substance stewardship programmes.33Expanding these stewardship programmes to include psychotropic medications may be a viable option. Research in the USA and Canada has shown a decrease in inappropriate drug use through pharmacist interventions facilitated by stewardship programmes.34,35Furthermore, given the generally lower public awareness of the risks associated with psychotropic drugs than those of narcotics, continuous education about the physical and psychological dependence risks associated with drug use is vital. Education should target both patients receiving prescriptions and the general public to ensure the safe use of these medications.Although there was an immediate increase in the proportion of patients exceeding the DDD of BzRAs after the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall impact of the pandemic on BzRA"
"prescriptions and the general public to ensure the safe use of these medications.Although there was an immediate increase in the proportion of patients exceeding the DDD of BzRAs after the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall impact of the pandemic on BzRA utilization was not significant. This suggests that the pandemic did not substantially change BzRA prescription patterns as had been expected. This observation adds a significant perspective to our understanding of prescription behaviours, indicating that factors influencing BzRA misuse are likely to be more deeply rooted in established healthcare practices than in transient external events like a global health crisis.Our study also revealed worrisome baseline trends in the concurrent prescription of BzRAs and opioid analgesics, as well as in the concurrent use of multiple BzRAs. These findings raise several important concerns about psychotropic medication management and public health. First, the concurrent use of BzRAs and opioid analgesics poses a potential risk to patients. Both drug classes can depress the central nervous system, leading to heightened sedation, respiratory depression and an increased risk of adverse events.36The observed increase in this concurrent prescription trend (coefficient: 0.0017;P= .0153) underscores the urgency of addressing the safety implications associated with these drug combinations.

"trend (coefficient: 0.0017;P= .0153) underscores the urgency of addressing the safety implications associated with these drug combinations. Healthcare providers should exercise caution when prescribing such medications concurrently, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse or in those at a higher risk of adverse reactions.Similarly, the concurrent increase in the proportion of patients prescribed multiple BzRAs (coefficient: 0.0161;P= .0126) is a matter of concern. The simultaneous use of multiple BzRAs can exacerbate the risks associated with these medications, including the potential for increased sedation, tolerance development and dependence.37This trend highlights the need for increased vigilance among healthcare professionals to ensure that patients do not receive redundant or excessive prescriptions for BzRAs from multiple sources. Such practices can contribute to inappropriate use and potential harm associated with these drugs.This study has several limitations. First, this study relied on claims data; therefore, it may be challenging to estimate the actual amount of medication consumed by patients as prescriptions and actual consumption may differ. Second, prescriptions that were not billed to insurance, even if reported in NIMS, were not included in the HIRA claims data. Therefore, medication usage may have been underestimated.

"even if reported in NIMS, were not included in the HIRA claims data. Therefore, medication usage may have been underestimated. Third, the absence of detailed clinical information in the claims data limited our ability to ascertain the exact reasons for the prescription of BzRAs. Finally, the study's focus on monthly prescription data restricted the in-depth analysis of individual patient prescription patterns, such as total medication duration or refill intervals.Nevertheless, this study is significant, as it is the first to assess the impact of NIMS implementation on the prescription patterns of oral BzRAs, which are among the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications. Consequently, this study suggests areas for enhancement and improvement following the implementation of NIMS. Furthermore, by analysing the prescription trends and inappropriate use tendencies of oral BzRAs in the entire population since 2016, we identified issues related to recent usage patterns. This information can serve as valuable data for future research and policies on psychotropic medications and narcotics.Ongoing monitoring and research on narcotic use after NIMS implementation and subsequent investigations into the patterns of inappropriate use of oral BzRAs at the patient level are warranted. Further studies on the inappropriate use of other psychotropic medications, such as injectables like propofol and ketamine, or appetite suppressants not covered by insurance, are also needed.5"
"use of oral BzRAs at the patient level are warranted. Further studies on the inappropriate use of other psychotropic medications, such as injectables like propofol and ketamine, or appetite suppressants not covered by insurance, are also needed.5 CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, although NIMS enhanced transparency in oral BzRA prescription reporting, it did not significantly reduce inappropriate usage trends. This finding underscores the need for comprehensive strategies beyond NIMS. Essential measures include continuous monitoring, system enhancements, education for healthcare providers and patients, and the establishment of controlled substance stewardship programmes. These integrated approaches are crucial to further reduce the misuse of psychotropic medications and to ensure their safe and effective use in clinical practice.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSHye Jin Son and Nam Kyung Je conceived and designed the study.

"AbstractIn order to improve based on financial shared services, enterprises can better promote the establishment, deepening, and optimal development of their own management accounting informatization. This paper introduces BPM system, analyzes the process perception accounting information system of business process management, and verifies that process perception can promote the research of accounting information system with the help of case analysis. Based on the problems, optimization scheme, and optimization effect of JKJT accounting informatization in a city, this paper makes a practical analysis and case analysis method. It is proposed that the four optimization effects of JKJT accounting informatization can be obtained by improving the authenticity and accuracy of subsystem business data, standardizing the division of personnel post rights and responsibilities, strictly implementing the system, changing the cost accounting method, and strengthening the training of management innovative accounting informatization talents and other optimization measures. Its main financial indicators show that the operating cost of JKJT in City A in 2019 was RMB 90.0309 million, a decrease of RMB 8.1781 million over 2020, a year-on-year decrease of 8.33%, mainly due to the establishment of financial sharing mode in 2019 and the strengthening of cost management and control of funds of branches by the finance department.

"decrease of 8.33%, mainly due to the establishment of financial sharing mode in 2019 and the strengthening of cost management and control of funds of branches by the finance department. At the same time, the acceptance measurement of the local project in City A is 57.0251 million yuan, because the project is operated locally, the financial service advantage is obvious, and the cost is relatively low. At the same time, by summarizing the application process of information management system, the in-depth analysis of information management system is realized. Information management system has strong efficiency in economic promotion. We should actively promote the application of the system to promote the improvement of economic construction level.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of economic globalization and informatization, enterprises are facing severe challenges and new development opportunities. The competitive environment of modern enterprises has undergone great changes [1]. Customer demand is diversified and personalized, the seller's market is transformed into the buyer's market, the pace of technological innovation is accelerated, the product life cycle is shortened, and the market dynamics are changeable. Customers, competition, and change are great challenges from the outside to the enterprise, while the organizational structure is the biggest challenge from the inside of the enterprise [2].

"Customers, competition, and change are great challenges from the outside to the enterprise, while the organizational structure is the biggest challenge from the inside of the enterprise [2]. The traditional management mode is centered on functional management. This mode is easy to cause too many levels, overstaffed institutions, unclear responsibilities, and other phenomena, so that enterprises cannot respond quickly to the requirements of the market and customers and then slowly lose their initiative in the rapidly changing market. Moreover, the division of internal functional departments makes the business process of enterprises in a state of segmentation and fracture. These factors make the management efficiency of enterprises low and the operation cost increase. In order to adapt to the rapidly changing and highly competitive market and enhance the ability of survival and development in this environment, enterprises need to change the management mode incompatible with the current business environment as soon as possible and establish an organizational structure and management mechanism that is convenient for external environmental changes and flexible response [3]. The summary of enterprise business volume is shown in Figures1and2. It can be seen from Figure1that the current internal business volume of the enterprise is increasing year by year from 2018 to 2020.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSummary data of enterprise business volume.Figure 2Open in figure"

This process management system is called \"the third wave of process management\" by researchers, and relevant research is being promoted in an all-round way. The new generation of process management takes the process as the center. By optimizing the enterprise organizational structure, process design, and customer-oriented horizontal process management system, improve the operation efficiency of the enterprise, optimize the utilization of resources and the cooperative relationship between personnel, reduce the operating cost of the enterprise, improve the response speed to customer needs, and realize the enterprise profit maximization. This business process management system has the characteristics of reusability, flexibility, and agility and has the ability of crossenterprise and technology platform to ensure the fluency and automation of business processes [4].

"and has the ability of crossenterprise and technology platform to ensure the fluency and automation of business processes [4]. However, in the past information process, there are great differences in various application systems of enterprises, forming heterogeneous application systems with different middle layers. Their interoperability and connection have become the main obstacle to high-level process integration management, and even there are problems of heterogeneous system integration within enterprises. With the deepening of the concept of business process reengineering (BPR) and the increasing maturity of the application of information technology, \"process thought\" and \"process redesign\" have gradually become the mainstream ideas of enterprise management in the 21st century. Accordingly, the traditional idea of building information system with function as the core has gradually shifted to \"process management\" and \"process control,\" resulting in the idea of process-aware information system. In Marlon Dumas's classic textbook of information systemProcess-Aware Information System, the definition of process-aware information system (PAIs) is given: \"a software system based on process model for managing and executing process, in which the process involves people, applications and information resources.\" From the perspective of application, process-aware information system supports the concept of business process reengineering.

"in which the process involves people, applications and information resources.\" From the perspective of application, process-aware information system supports the concept of business process reengineering. From the implementation level, it follows the model-driven architecture technology [5]. From the perspective of users, it adopts the operation mode like office automation system and runs through the whole process of system operation with the main line of business process. The purpose of this paper is to explore the reengineering of accounting information system with the help of the idea of process perception. This paper focuses on the process involved in enterprise real management. In management theory, enterprise process refers to the activity process of organizational structure and personnel using management information, technology, and methods to achieve enterprise objectives. A process can also be defined as an ordered collection of a series of logically related activities to complete a certain goal or task. The main body of the process is composed of activities, and there are not only strict sequence restrictions between activities. Moreover, the contents, methods, and responsibilities of activities must also be clearly arranged and defined, to make it possible for different activities to change hands between different post roles [6].2.
