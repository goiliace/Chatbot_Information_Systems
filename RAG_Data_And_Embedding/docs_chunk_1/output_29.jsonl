"AbstractWith the development of technology, the data stored by humans is growing geometrically. Especially in the logistics industry, the rise of online e-commerce has created a huge data flow in the informatized logistics network. How to collect, analyze, and organize this information in time and analyze the meaning of this information from it is a difficult problem. The paper aims to learn the management of logistics systems from the perspective of statistics. This article uses random analysis of 1,000 customers' logistics records from the logistics enterprise information system, uses mathematical analysis and matrix theory to analyze the correlation among them, and analyzes customer types and shopping. The information on habits, daily consumption patterns, and brand preferences is classified and summarized using mathematical statistics. The experimental results show that the results of the study can well reflect customers' daily habits and consumption habits. The experimental data show that mining effective and accurate information from massive information can help companies to quickly make decisions, formulate scientific logistics management programs, improve operating efficiency, reduce operating costs, and obtain good benefits.1.

"benefits.1. IntroductionThe modern logistics system is a complex system, including transportation, warehousing, distribution, handling, and packaging and logistics reprocessing, etc. The information flow is huge. The huge data flow makes it difficult for companies to collect and process these data accurately and efficiently, so it is difficult for decision makers to make fast and accurate decisions, to control the logistics process, and to reduce the logistics cost of the entire process. Logistics management information system is the basis of enterprise information systems and enterprise informatization.The main trend of global economic development is the informationization of the economy [1-3]. It is precisely due to the status quo that e-commerce, one-stop online shopping, and integrated network distribution processes have transformed the traditional logistics industry into high-tech new industries. The management of such systems has become a hot research direction for scholars from all sides. Because the logistics industry has different distribution methods and business planning methods, it is necessary to focus on fuzzy data analysis in the design [4,5]. The logistics method of the modern logistics system of data mining will be an important direction of logistics development. Therefore, GPS technology, GIS technology, and logistics industry need to be organically combined [6,7].Scholars such as Xuegin aim to use modern information technology to manage the medical"
"mining will be an important direction of logistics development. Therefore, GPS technology, GIS technology, and logistics industry need to be organically combined [6,7].Scholars such as Xuegin aim to use modern information technology to manage the medical traceability of implants. Methods: collect and analyze the problems existing in the traceability management of implantable medical devices, combine their own work practices, draw on the advanced methods of other industries and the research and analysis process of traceability management in key foreign countries to find out the network traceability model, and plan basic requirements of sexual management. Xuegin has designed and developed an implantable medical device traceability management information system, including logistics, supervision, traceability, and use traceability. Conclusion: the system standardizes the traceability management system well, unifies the traceability management process, and improves the efficiency of traceability management [8]. Qiang and other scholars use traditional classification methods to process the intercepted signals, and the different operating states of a single radar can be easily classified as multiple emitters, which adversely affects signal classification [9].The information age is a \"customer-centric\" era. Enterprises are no longer just building cars behind closed doors to develop products but are coming to customers. They truly treat customers as God, understand customer needs,"
"signal classification [9].The information age is a \"customer-centric\" era. Enterprises are no longer just building cars behind closed doors to develop products but are coming to customers. They truly treat customers as God, understand customer needs, and serve customers wholeheartedly. Analyzing customers' consumption habits from their daily consumption is a problem currently being solved. This article uses random analysis of 1,000 customers' logistics records from the logistics enterprise information system, uses mathematical analysis and matrix theory to analyze the correlation among them, and analyzes customer types and shopping. The information on habits, daily consumption patterns, and brand preferences is classified and summarized using mathematical statistics. The experimental results show that the results of the study can well reflect customers' daily habits and consumption habits.2. Proposed Method2.1. Research Status of Enterprise Logistics Based on Data Mining2.1.1. Research Status of Enterprise LogisticsAfter several years of rapid development, China's logistics industry has entered a stable and mature period, but there are still some problems compared with foreign advanced logistics companies:(1)The development of China's logistics industry is still constrained by market demand. Many companies have logistics departments inside, which has a certain impact on the development of China's professional logistics enterprises.(2)Relatively speaking, the service model of"
"of China's logistics industry is still constrained by market demand. Many companies have logistics departments inside, which has a certain impact on the development of China's professional logistics enterprises.(2)Relatively speaking, the service model of logistics companies is limited, and the management level of logistics companies needs to be further improved.(3)There is no overall unified management of the logistics industry, which hinders the establishment of a global logistics system.(4)The legal environment of the logistics industry is relatively bad. However, the logistics industry attaches great importance to the research of informatization and focuses on the hot research direction of the Internet of things. In 2010, the whole logistics industry began to realize the centralized integration of enterprise logistics information into a unified information system and use an advanced electronic label and bar code identification technology to speed up the efficiency of goods sorting [10-12]. In short, logistics companies are facing development opportunities and pressures in the fields of intelligent management and control, data mining, and big data processing. China's logistics enterprises can also learn from the development experience of foreign logistics enterprises. With the support of efficient and fast logistics technology, they are equipped with high-tech data mining and intelligent management and control technology so that logistics enterprises have an advantage in"

With the support of efficient and fast logistics technology, they are equipped with high-tech data mining and intelligent management and control technology so that logistics enterprises have an advantage in market competition.2.1.2. Research Status of Data Mining TechnologyWith the increasing amount of data in recent years, data mining technology [13,14] has also received more and more attention. At present, China's research on data mining mainly involves three aspects:(1)Research on data mining aspects, such as clustering research, association method research, and decision tree research.(2)Research based on data mining applications, such as financial data, medical data, e-commerce, and spatial geographic data.(3)Data mining based on the Internet, which mainly aims at mining and integrating a large amount of scattered data on the Internet [15,16]. As the top e-commerce company in China, the owner of Alibaba Company has a huge amount of user visits and shopping habits data. It can use data mining technology to analyze users' shopping habits, personalized needs, and behavior characteristics from a large number of complex data to design network products that are more suitable for users. The logistics industry also needs massive data mining and analysis. Now more and more logistics companies have begun to focus on the mining of logistics data, the calculation of logistics costs, and the evaluation of PKI performance.2.2. Components"

Now more and more logistics companies have begun to focus on the mining of logistics data, the calculation of logistics costs, and the evaluation of PKI performance.2.2. Components and Functions of Logistics Information System2.2.1. Composition FrameworkThe content and scope of modern logistics enterprises or enterprise logistics operations generally cover the links of raw materials and materials procurement, transportation, warehousing, distribution processing, loading and unloading, packaging, distribution, and corresponding information management, so the module composition of their logistics information system should include the requirements of these links and their derivatives provide corresponding management functions. Figure1shows the general framework of functional modules of a logistics information system.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointComposition framework of logistics information system.2.2.2. Steps of Data MiningHardware, software and users constitute the three major factors of the data mining environment. After the environment is ready, the next step is to follow the requirements analysis, initial data preparation, data mining implementation, and application of mining results to several stages of data mining.

Figure2shows the basic steps and content of data mining.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointData mining steps.2.3. CRM Based on Data Mining Technology2.3.1. The Role of CBRCRM is a cyclic process of interaction between enterprises and customers, and then it generates, collects, and analyzes customer data, and then the enterprise applies the results to its services and marketing activities. At the same time, CRM is an enterprise business model. A well-designed CRM solution can help companies improve their communication with existing customers while expanding new sources of revenue. This knowledge is generally expressed in the form of concepts, rules, rules, or patterns. Generally speaking, data mining is a key step of knowledge discovery in databases. It uses some specific knowledge discovery algorithms to search the data to find the knowledge hidden in these data.2.3.2. Application of CBRThe application of data mining in CRM is mainly focused on the following aspects:(1)Acquisition of new customers: mining new target customers is the key to the continuous growth of the enterprise, and it is also the first step in the life cycle of CRM customers. Acquiring new customers includes finding customers who do not know about your product and customers who previously received the services of your competitors.

"customers. Acquiring new customers includes finding customers who do not know about your product and customers who previously received the services of your competitors. The use of data mining can help complete the increasingly heavy division of potential customer groups, thereby effectively managing the cost of acquiring new customers and improving the effects of these activities, which can significantly increase the response rate of marketing activities and improve the return rate of marketing activities. Generally, methods such as statistical regression, logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, etc., are used in data mining to predict and analyze consumers' future behavior, generate prediction models, and establish scoring models. This model analyzes the potential customer groups and determines the target customers of the marketing activities from them [17,18].(2)Customer segmentation: segmentation can be achieved by using sorting, decision tree, or clustering methods in data mining. A few years ago, some banks subdivided their customers into four types of customer groups: top, important, core, and public. They provided targeted differentiated services, and their operating income more than doubled.(3)Cross-selling: now the relationship between enterprises and customers is constantly changing. Once a person or a company becomes a customer of our company, we must try our best to make this customer relationship tend to continue and develop for our company. In"
"now the relationship between enterprises and customers is constantly changing. Once a person or a company becomes a customer of our company, we must try our best to make this customer relationship tend to continue and develop for our company. In general, this can be achieved by maintaining this relationship for the longest time, trading with the customer a maximum number of times, and guaranteeing the maximum amount of profit per transaction. Therefore, companies need to cross-sell existing customer groups. It is based on the principle of \"win-win\" between enterprises and customers. For customers, they can get more and better products and services. For enterprises, they will also benefit from increased sales. Relevant analysis, sequence analysis, and other methods are usually used to implement cross-selling to customers. Data mining can help you analyze the optimal and reasonable sales match.2.4. Data Mining-Related Technologies Involved in System Construction2.4.1. Definition of Data Mining in Logistics Information ManagementThe three major areas of data mining technology application in logistics enterprise information management are customer relationship management, supply chain system management, and decision support. The use of data mining in customer relationship management can help logistics companies perform customer satisfaction analysis, customer churn analysis, customer value segmentation, customer loyalty analysis, and cross-selling analysis. Under the supply"
"The use of data mining in customer relationship management can help logistics companies perform customer satisfaction analysis, customer churn analysis, customer value segmentation, customer loyalty analysis, and cross-selling analysis. Under the supply chain operation mode, whether the connection of each link and process of the logistics enterprise is reasonable and scientific is vital to the efficiency of the entire system. It is even more important to introduce data mining technology into supply chain analysis and diagnosis [19]. In short, data mining technology has a very important support and support role in the decision support system of logistics enterprises.2.4.2. System ConstructionThe data mining-related technologies involved in building a data mining-based enterprise logistics intelligent management and control system [20,21] can be divided into knowledge-based data mining technology and statistics-based data mining technology. Specifically, the application fields of statistical data mining technology are relatively extensive, and the application theory is relatively mature. It mainly includes clustering data mining technology, data regression technology, clustering and measurement technology, and selection of proximity technology. Knowledge data mining technology mainly includes four aspects: neural network technology, genetic algorithm, decision tree technology, and rough set technology.

"technology. Knowledge data mining technology mainly includes four aspects: neural network technology, genetic algorithm, decision tree technology, and rough set technology. The following four technologies are introduced in detail:(1)Neural network technology: it is to imitate biological neural networks in terms of structure. It uses learning and training to complete the design of nonlinear prediction models. It regards each link as a separate processing unit and uses imitating human brain nerve operations. The pattern completes the data clustering, classification, and mining [22-24].(2)Genetic algorithm technology: this algorithm can start from any initial population by simulating the reproduction and gene mutation phenomenon in natural and genetic processes and use a random crossover, selection, and mutation to construct new populations.(3)Decision tree technology: its technology uses a tree-like method to train various variables in the data and build decision rules according to the goals. The more commonly used methods are CHAID and CART. Decision tree technology uses the variable groups in the decision set to build a tree structure and displays the construction method of the set under certain specific conditions. It is often used for risk analysis of loans.(4)Rough set technology: in the process of theory application, it is not necessary to grasp the prior conditions of the problem to determine the inherent law of the problem.

Rough set technology theory is mainly applied in fuzzy recognition and decision analysis [25].3. Experiments3.1. Experimental Settings3.1.1. Experimental BackgroundThe acceleration of the pace of economic globalization and the integration of the world market has made the market competition increasingly faced by enterprises, and logistics has gradually become the third source of profit for enterprises and an important area to cultivate their core competitiveness. Modern logistics activities and operations are integrated services that integrate transportation, warehousing, distribution processing, packaging, distribution, customer service, and information management. Each link generates and aggregates a large amount of information. A large amount of business information data has been accumulated during operation and implementation. In the information age, only with the help of advanced data analysis and mining tools can a large amount of business data information be processed and intelligently analyzed in a timely manner and can be effectively mined and found hidden behind the data knowledge and business model characteristics, so as to provide managers with effective data support for business management decisions [26-29].3.1.2.

"group for every 100 people. Study the group's shopping patterns and brand preferences. The study found that most consumers like to buy big brands and shop online. The general shopping patterns of customers are shown in Table1and Figure3. The customer's brand style is shown in Table2and Figure4.(2)Based on the above data, a classification analysis was performed on the types of customers. A survey of different consumer groups found that corporate personnel, civil servants, and company high collars accounted for a higher proportion of consumer groups. In addition, the survey also found that some staff have college students at home and abroad, especially female college students who have stronger spending power. The specific survey data are shown in Table3and Figure5.4.2. Statistics(1)After surveying customer types, consumption habits, shopping patterns, and brand preferences and conducting data analysis, using association principles for data mining, the ratio of purchase money and modification times is used as the integrity, and each group averages the average. Analyze each type of customer, from which you can analyze that the type of customer belongs to the credibility of the company's executives and corporate personnel and the number of integrity purchases is the highest. The type of customer is the highest purchasing power of female college students, but the integrity is low. The level of purchasing power of civil servants is stable and their integrity is relatively high."
"the number of integrity purchases is the highest. The type of customer is the highest purchasing power of female college students, but the integrity is low. The level of purchasing power of civil servants is stable and their integrity is relatively high. According to the results of data mining, by applying association rules, logistics companies can take the following measures to improve the quality of logistics services. The data summarized in the analysis are shown in Table4and Figure6.(2)The data analysis from Figure7shows that different types of customers, purchasing power, and purchasing habits should increase the development of these high-quality customers; the types of customers with long operating hours have relatively stable sources of logistics goods and a higher level of integrity, but their purchase money is not necessarily large. These logistics companies should give more preferential policies to consolidate the relationship with these customers to prevent customer outflow. The obtained experimental data was verified, and a random survey of 50 front-line personnel who performed this work was conducted.5. Conclusions(1)With the rapid growth of logistics companies and the widespread application of information systems, the amount of data information has also shown exponential growth. To improve the processing speed and processing effect of this massive information, it must be introduced in the logistics information system human data mining technology. Data mining"

Remaining operations and reducing logistics costs can also provide a scientific basis and data support for logistics business management decisions.(2)Analysis of customer types has become popular among logistics companies, and data mining technology is also developing vigorously. How to select the appropriate data mining algorithm for specific application problems is the key to the success of logistics companies. Explore and summarize.

"AbstractIn order to make up for the shortcomings of traditional financial evaluation, this paper proposes a method of enterprise comprehensive performance evaluation system based on the balanced scorecard method and BP artificial neural network model. This method focuses on the application methods and steps of BP artificial neural network model in enterprise comprehensive performance evaluation system. In addition, it also makes a detailed study on the initial weight and threshold assignment of the BP network, the selection of training samples, the determination of hidden layer, the convergence of network, and so on. The experimental results show that this method verifies the comprehensive performance evaluation results of 15 manufacturers, and the results are 4 excellent, 5 good, 3 average, 2 poor, and 1 very poor. This method effectively reduces the limitations of enterprise comprehensive performance evaluation by introducing nonfinancial evaluation indicators.1. IntroductionEconomic information is a description of the state of mutual connection and interaction in social and economic activities. It is an objective reflection of economic activities and their essential characteristics.

"includes the production, transmission, identification, processing, transformation, storage, retrieval, and control of economic information. It is a tool to present human information functions as a guide to the principles and processes of information research. Its important pillar is 3C (communication, computer, and control) technology. Its wide application will promote the rapid development of social productivity and lead to profound changes in social life [1].The characteristics of traditional economic information management are wide range of information sources, large amount of information, diverse but not complex ways and means of information processing, and often only elementary mathematical knowledge is enough. However, with the acceleration of the process of world economic integration, the randomness and uncertainty of economic information in the socio-economic system increase, and the form of the socio-economic system becomes more complex. There are many random, nonlinear, and time-varying complex socio-economic systems in reality. In order to effectively manage the economic information in the complex socio-economic system, the traditional economic information processing technology has been incompetent. Neural network theory and technology have shown strong functions not only in information recognition, transformation, and processing but also in information transmission, storage, and control.

"theory and technology have shown strong functions not only in information recognition, transformation, and processing but also in information transmission, storage, and control. Many research results have shown that neural network theory and technology have great potential in economic information processing in complex social systems [2,3].2. Literature ReviewFrom a macro perspective, the first concern is the standardization impact of the development of world economic globalization on human resource informatization. Economists mentioned that the globalization of enterprises and industries has promoted the standardization of systems and practices, as well as central planning and coordinated action. Second, European scholars believe that the implementation of a human resource management information system is of great significance to social responsibility and sustainable development of enterprises. At the microlevel, that is, within an enterprise, economists are also very interested in the diffusion of MNC's management information system between parent and subsidiary companies. Chen and Xu, in their cooperative works, discussed the localization of human resource management information system in the process of multinational corporation expansion, that is, the phenomenon and reason analysis of transfer from the parent company to the subsidiary company [4]. Similarly, Majumder and Mondal focused on the transfer process and root causes of the human resource management system of"
"corporation expansion, that is, the phenomenon and reason analysis of transfer from the parent company to the subsidiary company [4]. Similarly, Majumder and Mondal focused on the transfer process and root causes of the human resource management system of another multinational company from its subsidiary to its parent company [5]. This also shows how the digital human resource management platforms of different branches and parent and subsidiary companies affect each other in the same enterprise.At the same time, economists deeply explore the relationship between enterprise strategy and human resource management (Figure1). Numada discussed in detail the \"process of human resource management information system assisting in enterprise strategic decision-making\" [6] and also deeply discussed the dynamic influence relationship and influence principle of the interaction between human resource management function and strategic information management function. Zhang et al. believe that human resources strategy, principles, and system are an inseparable iron triangle and need to be considered as a whole [7]. Yang et al. applied the empirical analysis method to confirm the significance of the integration of information technology and human resource management for enterprise development, and the research results provide a basis for studying the relationship between human resource management and information technology from the economic level [8].Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the"

In order to survive in the long run and achieve sustainable development, businesses need to pay close attention to the development of their management systems [9]. Therefore, Lu et al. believe that a comprehensive performance evaluation procedure and goal are needed to guide the behavior of company management and employees in this field. The concept of measurement and the incentive process influence test and modify business growth performance through measurement. The results measure the implementation of the company's development strategy and then form the basis for strategic growth and business strategy reform [10].3. Research Methods3.1. Construction of Enterprise Comprehensive Performance Evaluation System3.1.1. Limitations of Traditional Financial Performance EvaluationUnder generally accepted accounting standards, the calculation of accounting income does not consider the cost of all capital but only the cost of debt capital, ignoring the compensation for the cost of equity capital.

"does not consider the cost of all capital but only the cost of debt capital, ignoring the compensation for the cost of equity capital. Under the accrual basis accounting system, due to the selectivity of accounting methods and the considerable flexibility of the preparation of financial statements, there is a certain degree of distortion in accounting income, which often cannot truly and comprehensively reflect the operating performance of enterprises [11]. At the same time, in the reflection of the intangible impact on the future development of the enterprise, the financial evaluation index is even more inadequate. One-sided emphasis on profits is likely to lead to the short-term behavior of operators sacrificing the long-term interests of the enterprise in pursuit of short-term benefits, which may encourage the thought of eagerness for quick success and instant benefits and short-term speculation of enterprise management authorities, and make enterprise operators unwilling to make the capital investment in pursuit of long-term strategic objectives and interests, which may reduce the current profit objectives [12]. Performance measurements consistently based on financial indicators indicate that there are a number of limitations and weaknesses in the performance measurement of the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce nonfinancial evaluation indicators on the basis of financial evaluation indicators to make up for the shortcomings of traditional financial"
"limitations and weaknesses in the performance measurement of the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce nonfinancial evaluation indicators on the basis of financial evaluation indicators to make up for the shortcomings of traditional financial evaluation.3.1.2. Build an Enterprise Comprehensive Performance Evaluation Index System Based on the Balanced ScorecardThe balanced scorecard performance evaluation method integrates financial and nonfinancial indicators [13], uses nonfinancial indicators from three dimensions of customers, internal business processes, learning, and innovation to make up for the shortcomings and defects of traditional financial evaluation indicators, and provides strong support for the strategic management of enterprises. Its index system has the characteristics of orientation, long-term, timeliness, and motivation and is gradually widely used. However, the balanced scorecard performance evaluation method only focuses on customers and ignores other important stakeholders, such as the government, the public, suppliers, and operators, which is extremely unfavorable to the development of enterprises. Therefore, on this basis, other stakeholder dimensions are added, and appropriate evaluation indicators are designed for each dimension.

The performance evaluation system is trained and optimized in the BP neural network model introduced below, and relevant indicators should be adjusted and modified in time according to the actual application effect and environmental changes, so as to meet the requirements of practical application [14].

Methods and Steps for Applying the BP Neural Network Model in the Field of Performance Measurement3.2.1. Basic Idea of BP Neural Network Application in Enterprise Comprehensive Performance EvaluationThe structure of the BP neural network consists of three layers: the input layer, the latent layer, and the output layer. The error was corrected by republishing the error. It is a computer with the properties of self-knowledge, self-organization, self-transformation, and self-learning.

"and self-learning. His experience is coded as a whole heavy network, storage, and error tolerance [15].Simple data sets of industry performance metrics are input to the login process and are sent to the output process after the encryption process is completed and evaluated for efficiency. In the anterior distribution phase, the state of the neurons in each layer affects only the state of the neurons in the next layer [16]. If the error value obtained from the release process and the desired result exceeds the permission error, the error recovery phase is entered. The error problem goes back to the old connection method, recalculates the error, takes the general error of the hidden process, adjusts the weight of each layer, and starts the hidden and unloading layer until the system error is received, and the weight and startup do not change this time. The network was adequately structured using the standardized BP training algorithm. The group of weights of the training network is the weight of the industry's performance measurement in determining [17]. Finally, in accordance with the principles of the BP training model, the specific costs of measuring the performance of the target sector can be taken to achieve the target market performance. It can be divided into measurement models, appropriate levels, and used to measure performance and compare similar plants [18].3.2.2.

"market performance. It can be divided into measurement models, appropriate levels, and used to measure performance and compare similar plants [18].3.2.2. Establish a Performance Measurement System Based on the BP Neural NetworkThe topology of the BP model for production performance measurement is shown in Figure2. The model consists of three nerve cells: the input layer, the latent layer, and the output layer. Layer nerve cells are fully interconnected, and there is no interaction of neurons in one layer [19], refer to the measurement data given in Tables1-3. Twenty measurement data were selected as network input neurons, along with a representative for each type of measurement. The input data of the neurons in the input process are the simple data of the performance measurement system after completion. At present, there is no general structure for the concealment process. If necessary, the latent layer containing 8 neurons is adjusted. The urinary tract contains only one nerve cell, and the effects of urinary tract nerve cells are commercial [20]. It is a nonquantitative index of comprehensive enterprise valuation that ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the higher the performance of the enterprise, and vice versa.Open in figure viewerPowerPointSuppose that the input layer of the BP neural network hasnneurons, the output layer hasqneurons, and the hidden layer haspneurons.

The random number between [−1, +1] can be used to initialize the weight and threshold [22].(2)Standardized processing of sample data. For quantitative indicators, the linear proportional transformation method is used to standardize the original data. For positive index (benefit type) data,S＝(S−Smin)/(Smax−Smin). For the reverse cost indicator,S＝(Smax−S)/(Smax−Smin). The qualitative index should be transformed into a score between 0 and 1 by the fuzzy evaluation method and then used as the input value.(3)Randomly select an input-output mode to input BP network, where the input vector is, and the expected output vector is. Each training mode (sample) includes standardized input index data and corresponding expected output.(4)The input activation valueand the response output valueof each neuron in the hidden layer were calculated. Input activation value of neurons in hidden layer [23] is as follows:(1)wherej= 1,2, ...,p. The response output value of each neuron in the hidden layer is.

For the neurons in the output layer, the expected output (teacher value) vector is, the actual output vector of the BP network is, and the correction error of each neuron in the output layer is [24](3)wheret＝1,2, ...,q.

Now, the improved BP algorithm is widely used; that is, the momentum parameter is added to its weight coefficient to prevent it from repeated oscillation and nonconvergence.The new connection weight adjustment formula between the hidden layer and the output layer is as follows (5):(5)where ΔVjt(N+ 1) is the adjustment value of theN+ 1st weight,Vjt(N+ 1) =Vjt(N) + ΔVjt(N+ 1).αis the inertia factor,α∈ (0,1).

After the calculation, you can get the execution of the business plan. The target business classification and performance level can be determined by comparing the evaluation results with the best performance measurement standards. When using the BP neural network model to complete the measurement of market performance, the weight of each measure that affects market performance is also taken. Based on the scales, the impact of each scale rating and measure on business performance can be determined; it can also identify factors that have a positive impact on business success, and the industry should prioritize performance improvement [25].4. Result Analysis4.1. Programming Calculation and Empirical ResearchThe model BP neural network can be integrated into the neural network toolbox model in the Matlab environment. The main steps are (1) initiation of the BP model.

"When creating a BP network, the BP network can be started using the initff () function if differences of opinion, number of neurons in each layer, and function are known. (2) BP network training: the trainbp, trainbpm, and trainlm functions can train the BP network. Their use is similar, but the rules are different. The trainbp function recognizes the standard BP algorithm, and the trainbpm function recognizes the heuristic function. They are not very creative in practice. Work trainlm uses Levenberg Marquardt's improved method, which makes training hours shorter and more accurate but requires more memory for work and training. (3) BP network output: it is used to measure or calculate the results of the simuff function based on the optimal weight and initial growth obtained as a result of the training [26].The business performance measurement model and algorithm along the BP neural network proposed in this article can be used in combination with the MATLAB function to measure the performance of trading companies' partner organizations.

ConclusionA comprehensive enterprise performance assessment method based on a BP neural network model can make full use of relevant information on sample parameters. With the help of nonlinear mapping, this work reveals the internal mechanism between the overall performance of the enterprise and the factors that affect it in order to fundamentally overcome the difficulties encountered in modeling and solving the complex performance assessment of the enterprise. This method is highly efficient and applicable because it is self-learning, adaptable, tolerant of errors, and very easy to program and analyzes all assessment processes and steps on a computer. This method is sufficient only to enter the processed data into the network and perform the calculations. It is not necessary to artificially determine the weight. It is possible to effectively reduce the human factor in the evaluation process, increase the reliability of the evaluation, and make the evaluation results more effective and realistic.

"human factor in the evaluation process, increase the reliability of the evaluation, and make the evaluation results more effective and realistic. However, much attention needs to be paid to the initial weight distribution of the BP network, the selection of training samples, the design of the underlying layer, and the network integration. A comprehensive enterprise performance assessment method based on a BP neural network model is preferable if effective measures and algorithms can be developed to address these issues.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Darby Z.,Poudyal N.

"AbstractHealth information management systems help gather, compile, and analyze health data to help manage population health and reduce healthcare costs. It can support the clinical decision, help diagnose individual patients, and improve patient care. In this study, a personal health information management system based on Java is presented. Based on the Java platform, the overall hierarchical structure of the system is designed including a health information management module, personal health data synchronization module, and full-text retrieval module, to realize the functions of the system. To improve the security of personal health information, the data encryption standard (DES) algorithm is implemented to encrypt and protect personal healthcare information. The system is evaluated in terms of health information acquisition accuracy, information security, and system response time. To verify the robustness of the proposed health information management system, it is compared with two related studies. The maximum health information acquisition accuracy of the system is 99%, the safety factor reported is above 0.9, and the maximum response time is only 0.8 s. The experimental results show that the designed personal health information management system can collect health information more accurately and ensure the security of information, and the overall response time is shorter.1.

"management system can collect health information more accurately and ensure the security of information, and the overall response time is shorter.1. IntroductionA big challenge that patients face today in healthcare is the unavailability of access to their health information. Idyllically, patients will have a complete and updated version of their health information, which can be made accessible to any provider that they wish to use it. As patients move, travel, and get their care from different care providers, their treatment records are shared across multiple sites where they have received treatment. These medical records are usually not shared and updated unless the sites are part of a network of providers that share common medical information systems [1]. Past treatment records are an essential input in clinical decision-making, and without the consolidation of all related medical information, there is a risk of inefficient treatment, delays in diagnosis, and medical errors.Recently, people's living standards have significantly improved. At the same time, the concept of healthy life has attracted more and more attention. People's attention to personal healthcare and disease prevention has become stronger and stronger. At the same time, the accelerating pace of life, food safety, and the increasing trend of population aging have caused a strong impact on traditional medical care and healthcare methods.

"At the same time, the accelerating pace of life, food safety, and the increasing trend of population aging have caused a strong impact on traditional medical care and healthcare methods. How to conveniently realize and comprehensively master their health information, realize the prevention of chronic diseases and more accurate diagnosis, and realize personal health information management has become a topic of increasing concern [2].The rapid development of information communication and computing power [3] provides great potential for medical information access, collection, sharing, and analysis. These technologies provide exceptional chances to support next-generation healthcare systems. A major fence today is how to personalize healthcare services and to help people to enhance current offered healthcare services and applications. Zhe and Yongli [4] proposed a healthcare data management system based on integrated learning. The system is comprised of multiple layers in which the administrator operates and manages the operation layer to achieve system control, regulation, and application. The big data analysis layer is used to obtain the health data prediction results fused with multidimensional parameter information.

A distributed health information system that uses the service-oriented architecture as a basis for developing, implementing, installing, managing, and calling e-healthcare services was presented in [8]. The system is based on multimedia input and output, such as graphics and speech, which makes the system more pretty to users who are not computer-oriented. Li et al.

The system is divided into three layers, web layer, service layer, and PO layer. The system can provide better maintainability and reliability in healthcare services. Ngai et al.

With the support of the Java platform, the reliability of the personal health information management system is improved, and the encryption algorithm is used to encrypt and securely transmit personal health information.The rest of the paper is ordered as follows. In Section2, the proposed healthcare information management system is presented and the different modules and functions are illustrated. In Section3, the results of the proposed system are discussed, and the conclusion is given in Section4.2. Personal Health Information Management System Based on JavaJava platform is a specification and standard for developing distributed enterprise applications. It provides developers with a set of powerful application programming interfaces (APIs) to facilitate users' network application development. Developers can build reusable and flexible web applications through this platform.

"in global enterprise application information systems [12]. Java uses a distributed multilayer application model, divides the application logic into different components according to functions, and divides the two-layer model into four layers, and the layers are independent of each other. Each layer is assigned a specific service. The idea of layering enables the client to solve the problems of data reception and data display. The overall structure of the proposed personal health information management system constructed is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure of the personal health information management system.The disruption of the different layers in the layered architecture of Java is given as follows:(i)Client Layer.This layer directly interacts with system users. The client layer presents the result data information of the server background processing to users. The Java platform supports multiple types of users, such as hypertext markup language (HTML) and Java Applet, usually a browser.(ii)Presentation Layer.This layer is mainly managed by the web container and used to receive user requests. The presentation layer passes the received data to the business logic layer and returns the results processed by the business logic layer to the client layer. Usually, the function of the presentation layer is realized by Java server pages (JSP) or Servlets [10].(iii)Business Logic Layer.It provides services for the presentation layer to process"
"results processed by the business logic layer to the client layer. Usually, the function of the presentation layer is realized by Java server pages (JSP) or Servlets [10].(iii)Business Logic Layer.It provides services for the presentation layer to process business logic and provides necessary interfaces. The business logic layer stores the data provided by the presentation layer into the information system layer after corresponding processing and also returns the processing results to the presentation layer.(iv)Information System Layer.The services of this layer are mainly implemented in the database system for storing and retrieving information.Since Java is a platform-independent language, products based on the Java platform can run on any operating system and hardware in the market. Therefore, products developed on the Java platform can reduce secondary development caused by platform upgrades and project migration. The Java platform provides an excellent platform for software application developers to develop efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use web applications [13].2.1. System Hardware Design2.1.1. Health Information Management ModuleA personal health information system should be easy and convenient to work because its users are mostly patients and clinicians.

"users are mostly patients and clinicians. The users should be able to use the client via a web browser as the operation of the system interface, and they can be able to use the web interface directly [14]. Based on the above consideration, this system is developed and designed based on the Java EE platform. The architecture of the personal health information management module is depicted in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointFunctional structure of health information management module.Personal file management is mainly divided into two file management categories: visit report and health file. The visit report manages the user's medical information records in the form of file management, such as hospital information, department information, medical personnel information, and inspection report. The personal health information management system also maintains the most basic and perfect health file information for individual users. Health files should meet national standards, have comprehensive information coverage, and realize the characteristic management of the whole life [15].The health data management function mainly realizes the classified management of personal sign data, cardiovascular data, and other health data.

"health data. As the information data with obvious personal health characteristics, personal sign data, and cardiovascular data have the characteristics of relatively mature data measurement technology, relatively stable data changes, and serious impact of abnormal data on physical health. They are widely used in health examination and the prevention of chronic diseases.In addition to core functions such as health information management, the health information management module also provides health service management.(1) Healthcare Knowledge Popularization. For common health problems, the information management module can recommend medical and health knowledge popularization for users, improve users' medical and health knowledge level, and require the content of medical and health knowledge base to be simple, easy to understand, rigorous, and reliable.(2) Visit Information Recommendation. This module comprehensively recommends the medical institution information with user characteristics according to the existing user's health information, the basic information of the connected medical institution, the specialty of the department, and the comprehensive medical ability. Moreover, it can also provide users with geographic location information of medical institutions.(3) Personal Health Information Sharing. This module can be used by patients to query their health files, medical reports, and health data by authorizing other users [16].(4) Complaints and Suggestions. In addition"
"information of medical institutions.(3) Personal Health Information Sharing. This module can be used by patients to query their health files, medical reports, and health data by authorizing other users [16].(4) Complaints and Suggestions. In addition to providing users with the input and suggestion function of the personal health information management system platform, users can also be provided with the ability to evaluate and complain about medical institutions and medical personnel. Users' evaluation and complaint suggestions can be used as an assessment index of the comprehensive ability of medical institutions and medical personnel [17].2.1.2. Personal Health Data Synchronization ModuleIt is essential to analyze the synchronization of patient data among health facilities using electronic medical records systems. The application of modern technology in the healthcare system aims to upsurge the reliability, convenience, and productivity of delivered healthcare services [18]. The proposed personal health information management system is an application system based on a medical system database. In the development of such systems, it is indispensable to establish synchronization mechanisms and data sharing between the different databases. In this study, encryption techniques are used to encrypt data transmission. Moreover, firewalls and other security measures are also added for protection.

"databases. In this study, encryption techniques are used to encrypt data transmission. Moreover, firewalls and other security measures are also added for protection. The network topology of synchronous transmission of the personal health data is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointNetwork topology of synchronous transmission of personal health data.To synchronize data between the webserver service center and the data center of the platform, a general transmission protocol must be designed, and data transmission can be carried out based on this transmission protocol. Because the data center needs to synchronize data with multiple application systems, the coupling of the system must also be considered when designing the synchronization network topology; that is, in the design process, the data dependence between systems should be reduced as much as possible.2.1.3. Full-Text Retrieval ModuleTo achieve a comprehensive retrieval of personal health and medical data, the full-text retrieval module is designed using the integrated model of Solr and HBase. Solr is an enterprise-level search server development framework based on Apache Lucene. It uses an API interface similar to RESTful Web Service. Therefore, its indexing method is similar to the Key-Value pair used by HBase. It is very convenient to call, which makes the integrated development based on Solr and HBase relatively convenient.

The overall structure of the full-text search module is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall structure of the full-text retrieval module.2.2. System Software DesignPrivacy-preserving is at present a highly active domain of the healthcare system. Ensure safe and reliable medical data are stored. It is very suitable for software and hardware requirements as encryption and decryption take the same algorithm. In this algorithm, only the encryption function needs to be reversed and the round keys to be taken in opposite order [19]. To protect users' health data, data encryption standard (DES) symmetric encryption is used to encrypt personal health data. The main process of DES symmetric encryption is to perform calculations fixedly. There are 64 bit plain texts, which are converted into 56 bit secret keys to achieve encryption. The schematic diagram of DES symmetric encryption is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of DES symmetric encryption.Each round of calculation is a set of procedures for DES symmetric encryption.

This is important because bad equipment, poor data processing, or human error can lead to inaccurate results that are not very close to the truth. The accuracy represents how precisely the measured values reflect the real or the original values of the personal health information system [20]. Figure9shows the comparative results of the proposed health information system with the personal health information systems presented in [4,5], respectively.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison results of health information acquisition accuracy.It can be seen that in a long experimental time, the information acquisition accuracy of the proposed health information system always maintains a high level, and the maximum acquisition accuracy reaches 99%. The acquisition accuracy of the system based on integrated learning and the system based on B/S architecture fluctuates greatly, and the maximum acquisition accuracy of the two systems is always less than 90%.

Because of personal health information and secret information of users, the system needs to protect users' health information and avoid illegal and unauthorized access. Therefore, a personal health information management system is required to have high information security. The information security factor is a parameter between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the higher the security of information is. The information security comparison results of the three systems are shown in Table2. It can be seen that the safety factor of the proposed personal health information is always maintained above 0.9, while the highest safety factor of the two comparison methods is only 84. The average safety factor of the proposed system is 0.968, the average safety factor of the system based on integrated learning is 0.695, and the average safety factor of the system based on B/S architecture is 0.692, respectively. Therefore, it is verified that the proposed system can improve the security of personal health information.Table  2.Comparison results of information security.No. of experiments/timeInformation security factorProposed systemSystem based on integrated learningSystem"

System Response TimeSystem response time is the time between when the user initiates an action and when the health information system starts to display the result. Health information systems must answer to external interactions in the environment within a predetermined amount of time. Health information systems must provide the correct result and generate it in a timely manner. This means that response time is as important as producing correct results. Real-time systems must be developed to meet these response times. Hardware and software must be developed to support response time requirements for these systems. The response time comparison results of the three systems are shown in Table3.Table  3.Comparison results of system response time.No. of experiments/timeSystem response time (s)Proposed systemSystem based on integrated learningSystem based on B/S architecture10.56.45.420.65.66.530.55.96.840.76.36.450.86.96.260.55.87.170.65.96.680.75.96.490.66.56.7100.86.16.2Observing the comparison results of system response time, it can be found that"

The maximum response time of the proposed system is 0.8 s, that of the integrated learning system 6.1 s, and that of the system based on B/S architecture is 7.1 s, respectively. This proved that the system is much faster than the existing personal health information systems in providing feedback to the patients and clinicians.4. ConclusionIn this paper, we presented a personal health information management system based on a Java that uses the service-oriented architecture as a basis for designing, implementing, deploying, managing, and invoking e-healthcare services. We developed a web-based personal health information management system that can be used by patients to collect and manage their health information, request self-referrals, and store a record of their consultations. The system is composed of multiple modules, with each module providing different healthcare functions. To verify the robustness of the proposed health information management system, we compared it with two related studies, and the results were found better than the state-of-the-art models.

The experimental results show that the designed personal health information management system can collect health information more accurately and ensure the security of information, and the overall response time is shorter. The maximum health information mining of this system is 99%, the safety factor is always above 0.9, and the maximum response time is only 0.8. Therefore, it shows that the proposed personal health information management system can improve the overall management performance from many aspects.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Fang S.,Simulation of health information symptoms in central Chinese clinical data,Computer Simulation.

At the same time, the construction level of our cities urgently needs to be more on a higher level, making the shortage of land resources and mineral resources present new challenges in the process of land resource management, so how to improve the speed of land and mineral resource use has become a key issue that urgently needs to be solved nowadays, and land resource management departments need to effectively combine information technology, land information management technology, and resource information management technology. Using the abovementioned technologies can improve the efficiency of land and mineral resource information management, and the influx of information technology has gradually become the direction of improvement in the development of land security management [2].With the advent of the new era, the comprehensive management of land resources is currently undergoing a comprehensive reform and comprehensive construction; the promotion is mainly carried out from three aspects of information technology, land information management and scientific management, and the standardized management"
"is currently undergoing a comprehensive reform and comprehensive construction; the promotion is mainly carried out from three aspects of information technology, land information management and scientific management, and the standardized management of land resource information; land resources cover a variety of natural information, through a transparent information management system, to achieve scientific management; transparent system can enhance the land. The transparency system can enhance the efficiency of land resource management, strengthen the degree of information sharing, and face the public development which is more conducive to the power from the private sector. According to each information and demand analysis and considering the current situation of information technology development, this paper proposes a comprehensive management information service system for the construction of urban land resources, by realizing the functional modules within each management business [3]. An information sharing platform is built, while the business process model of information management is optimized and while helping the relevant departments using the system to improve their efficiency; at the same time, in order to avoid relatively isolated data that cannot be effectively used, the use of information systems can effectively use the data, the overall structure of which is a system building model with application requirements as the core [4].

In terms of land resource management, American scientists in 1998 had proposed the concept of digital earth, that is, the digital construction and layout of global geographic information; digital earth is the layout of network informationization of land resource information, virtualized storage of realistic land resource information, and, with it, the corresponding birth of geographic information system. With the development of national land informationization, in the late twentieth century, Western countries such as Canada joined one after another in the comprehensive construction of digital earth, and at the moment of the end of the twentieth century, various publications, maps, and earth science information from various units have been integrated, so users can query, browse, and"

Use Case AnalysisUse case analysis is a functional level research study that captures the functionality of the system from a macro perspective. The use cases include its definition, all the necessary behaviors to execute the use case order, the standard behaviors in different deformations, the general behaviors of all the abnormal cases, and the expected responses, without revealing the premise that the internal structure of the system defines a consistent behavior. From a user's point of view, the above cases may be abnormal cases; from the system's point of view, they must be described and attached to the handling of the case. More specifically, the use of the case is not required for functional specification but also shows and demonstrates its requirements in the process of illustration, in UML, using cases represented by an ellipse, in which the execution of each use case is independent from the other use cases, although due to the fact that when the case is shared, objects can generate implicit correlations between use cases for reasons of execution between a use case, each use case described in the vertical functional block, the execution of that functional block can be carried and mixed with other cases together, as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in"
"between use cases for reasons of execution between a use case, each use case described in the vertical functional block, the execution of that functional block can be carried and mixed with other cases together, as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem use case increasement.The functional functions have a many-to-many relationship with the system participants, where user roles with different privileges can perform the same functional functions, while each class of role users can perform multiple functional functions. There are various complex relationships between functions such as dependency, inclusion, and extension. By subdividing a function into multiple functions, the hierarchical relationship of the functional structure of the use case diagram is realized. In the use case diagram, participants are used for system functions, through the use case diagram that has clear participant system, you can see each participant's clear function at the same time; the use case diagram is very expressive; in the beginning of the do requirement analysis, we can derive the use case diagram and user verification, and thus, further, in each functional module of the subsystem, the aspect of the use case diagram in the system functional modeling is necessary.Treating the field of land resource information construction has gradually figured out and summarized a set of suitable local land resource management methods, while with the help of today's popular information"
"the system functional modeling is necessary.Treating the field of land resource information construction has gradually figured out and summarized a set of suitable local land resource management methods, while with the help of today's popular information technology; in the actual work, Dalian City land capital has indeed taken a big step forward, compared to the previous work effectiveness that rose a lot, which has been built and put into use in some pilot cities and county land administration; through the use of information technology system, the effect is obvious; land resource information management is more orderly; and there is advanced technology overlay. Covering all urban construction, in the network environment, makes full use of land use dynamic remote sensing monitoring and remote management of cadastral information; in recent years, the land area change data will be used to obtain the most accurate records; the local government has been introduced in due course suitable for the construction of policies; land management information system has been used in certain areas in the city, where advanced technology is currently being promoted and popularized, a strong impetus to the development of land information and technology team and the growth of information resources of land.

"team and the growth of information resources of land. This paper will focus on the design and implementation of land resource information system.Land resource management plays a very important role in the long-term development of both our economy and society. Along with the urgent need for economic development, the process of using land and mineral resources has created increasingly serious problems, which cover other key contradictory issues such as illegal use and occupation of land. At the same time, the construction level of our cities urgently needs to be more on a higher level, making the shortage of land resources and mineral resources present new challenges in the process of land resource management, so how to improve the speed of land and mineral resource use has become a key issue that urgently needs to be solved at present, and land resource management departments need to effectively combine information technology, land information management technology, and resource information management technology; using the abovementioned technologies can improve the efficiency of land and mineral resource information management, and the influx of information technology gradually becomes the direction of upgrading the development of land security management.At the same time, in order to avoid relatively isolated data that cannot be effectively used, the use of information systems can effectively use data, the overall structure of which is a system construction model with"
"of land security management.At the same time, in order to avoid relatively isolated data that cannot be effectively used, the use of information systems can effectively use data, the overall structure of which is a system construction model with application requirements as the core. Land resources are the natural treasures of the country's social development and survival, and effective management of the country's land resources can provide a favorable guarantee for the survival and development of the majority of people, while the effective use and development of natural resources can make an outstanding contribution to the economic development of our country. The full and rational use and protection of land resources can ensure the implementation of sustainable development policies, and the development of national land resource management is a basic requirement for the modernization of the country as well as an inevitable trend at the national level, as land resource management covers a large amount of information involved in the vast scope, including the scope of work of the information, as shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointFlow chart of land approval.3.3.

"design is mainly to conceptualize the attributes of the entities involved in the system, design a suitable type for each attribute, build a database information table for each type of entity, record the changes of data information of the entity during the operation of the system, synchronize with the database in time, and maintain the normal operation of the system. According to the entity relationship model in the conceptual design stage of the database, certain conceptualization work is needed for the database, and some theories exist to study the relationship between database members, which mainly explore and study the relationship between objects, and there are dependency relationships, backup, and organization. The detailed database design is mainly to conceptualize the attributes of the entities involved in the system, design a suitable type for each attribute, build a database information table for each type of entity, record the changes of data information of the entity during the operation of the system, synchronize with the database in time, and maintain the normal operation of the system.(1)According to each information and demand analysis and taking into account the current situation of information technology development, this paper proposes a comprehensive management information service system for the construction of urban land resources, which builds an information sharing platform by realizing functional modules within each management business, while"
