"of scenic spots by 6.7%, and increase the satisfaction of tourists by 4.1%. The digital management of tourism information resources based on machine learning can optimize the tourism industry and promote its development.1. IntroductionWith the continuous development of society and the improvement of people's living standards, tourism has become more and more popular and one of the largest and most powerful industries in the world today. With the popularization and application of the modern network, people's understanding of information about traveling is gradually changing to the network, and people's requirements for the tourism industry are also increasing. As the core technology of artificial intelligence, the tourism industry in the information age must provide efficient, fast, and convenient services, and the digital construction of tourism information resources is the basic work to improve the quality of tourism. Machine learning can divide the structure of information resources and effectively improve management efficiency. Applying machine learning to the digital management system of tourism information resources can quickly classify and integrate tourism information, make the information resources in tourism more systematic and standardized, and quickly promote the development of the tourism industry.As a simple and effective management method, digital management is used by many researchers.

"systematic and standardized, and quickly promote the development of the tourism industry.As a simple and effective management method, digital management is used by many researchers. Matzner et al. discussed the significance of digital management of hybrid library, introduced one of the digital management system models LRP (Library Resource Planning) based on SCM, and analyzed the role of commercialization [1]. To solve the contradiction between heritage protection and tourism development, Huddar et al. explored through digital management and analyzed its principle based on coordination theory. The safeguard measures to strengthen the synergy effect of digitalization are put forward, and the digitalization construction initially shows the good effect of coordinated management in protection and development [2]. Buchanan et al. has developed a digital management system for the management of raw materials. The actual demand and raw material management process are analyzed. Combined with the actual technology and production conditions, the developed system is applied to a large sintering yard. The actual running result of the application proves the effectiveness of the system [3]. Kovtunenko and But-Gusaim have developed a set of digital management information systems for the intensive dairy farm milking process, providing a series of convenient and intelligent raw data input interfaces, which can make statistics, analysis, and graphic display of milking data according to"
"a set of digital management information systems for the intensive dairy farm milking process, providing a series of convenient and intelligent raw data input interfaces, which can make statistics, analysis, and graphic display of milking data according to different types of cows or herds with different parity in a specific time period and can dynamically generate some important derivative data [4]. In order to reduce urban carbon emissions, Shmyhel used the digital model of urban management to manage cities, improve decision-making quality and efficiency, strengthen the connection between the Internet of things industry and the information industry, and improve the urban management level and quality [5]. Powell developed a digital management system to support the management process of historical building assets based on public participation, established a digital management framework system of tangible cultural heritage based on HBIM, and manages historical building assets in Malang. The framework of sustainable life-cycle heritage management has been realized [6]. Kim and Moon counted the automatic control drip irrigation device in digital management of macadamia nuts, including drip irrigation pipe, soil moisture sensor, motor, water storage room, water pump, and central controller, and gave the implementation plan.

"motor, water storage room, water pump, and central controller, and gave the implementation plan. The device is not only convenient for laying and positioning but also convenient for controlling the overall irrigation water consumption and accurately using it during each drip irrigation period, thus improving the digital management level [7]. The above research shows the advantages of digital management, but with the emergence of new technologies and new situations, new problems appear.As a mainstream learning method, machine learning has appeared in many research works and is deeply loved by scholars. Helma et al. used machine learning technology for oil spill detection and uses specific case studies to illustrate problems such as problem formulation, evaluation measure selection, and data preparation and links these problems with the attributes of oil spill applications to reduce the harm to the environment [8]. Sidiropoulos introduced the confusing results of different types of text and language data sets by using machine learning algorithm and discusses its application in automatic document indexing. Experiments show that machine learning has substantial and consistent improvement compared with standard latent semantic analysis [9].

"analysis [9]. Mullainathan and Spiess applied machine learning (ML) technology to the new research of IP traffic classification-the interdisciplinary integration of IP network and data mining technology. This paper discusses some key requirements of using ML-based traffic classifier in operating IP network and qualitatively criticizes the extent to which the reviewed work meets these requirements [10]. Wang et al. described a fast filtering algorithm based on machine learning, which can be applied to deal with different problems. Tests using new methods, such as the first step of naive Bayes, model-based learning, decision tree, local weight loss, and preprocessing steps of the model tree, show that the decision tree and model tree constructed from preprocessed data are usually much smaller [11]. Chen and Asch proposed machine learning methods using positive definite kernel. These methods formulated learning and estimation problems in Hilbert space (RKHS), the reproduction kernel of functions defined in data domain, and extended them according to the kernel [12]. Voyant et al. proposed that Spark open source development should be distributed in MLlib machine learning library. MLlib provided effective performance for many training programs, including many basic statistics, optimization, and linear algebra, which can make users get started quickly [13].

"training programs, including many basic statistics, optimization, and linear algebra, which can make users get started quickly [13]. Pound et al. designed a multimachine learning library to develop algorithms that are easy for machine learning, especially for deep connection networks. The combination of descriptive signal expression and special tensor parameters provides automatic differentiation to derive gradient [14]. The above results show that many researchers have achieved good results by using machine learning technology.Machine learning is a method to encourage automatic use of the system and reduce errors, which is widely used. This paper adopts machine learning technology to manage information resources digitally, analyzes the distribution of tourism information resources, and uses the decision iteration tree and LambdaMART method to manage tourism information. We divide the information into documents one by one and extract keywords for classification; it can improve the timeliness and accuracy of information processing, save scenic spot expenditure for the tourism industry, promote the development of the industry, and bring more value to the tourism industry.2.

"Framework Design of the Information Resource Management PlatformTourism resource management platform takes network communication as the channel of information exchange and transmission, and based on the application environment provided by data center as the main core for system application development technology, it provides \"one-stop\" service for content integration and application integration for tourism enterprises. Using artificial intelligence technology to process and analyze tourism information provides a comprehensive and effective information exchange and interactive sharing service platform for the travel industry and the public. Information management platform construction should include network communication, network construction, resource center construction, system environment construction, safe working environment construction, application development environment construction, information classification construction, and so on. They can provide \"integrated\" services for tourists, including information resource interaction services, tourist authentication services, integrated analysis services, application integration services, and information services, as shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointNetwork communication environment is the transmission channel of the information resource management platform, the platform for information transmission, exchange, and distribution, which provides a shared platform for information management and analysis and"
"communication environment is the transmission channel of the information resource management platform, the platform for information transmission, exchange, and distribution, which provides a shared platform for information management and analysis and communication support for information exchange. Data center is the main component of the tourism information management platform, and it is the center of storage, integration, exchange, and management of a lot of tourism information [15]. GIS environment is supported by technology, and a multisite information system framework is established to provide suitable integration areas for location data and various data types. The purpose of application development environment is to define and realize data sharing by compiling a unified data exchange template and data exchange system. The security service environment realizes the data security, application security, and network security of the tourism information resource management platform through system security service configuration, constructs a security guarantee system and multilevel application of security access control, security control, identity authentication of tourists, security services, etc., defines security-related test contents and test methods, and automatically develops security control files.

"test contents and test methods, and automatically develops security control files. We ensure consistent security system and file synchronization. The information portal is the window through which the information management platform provides instant information services for tourists and managers at all levels of the tourism industry. Integrating multiple travel application systems with a unified information gateway system provides users with a unified system that supports terminal multi-interface devices and realizes the \"integrated\" system function.2.2. System Business Flow ChartThrough the follow-up investigation of the business and demand of the travel industry, the data flow process of the tourism resource management information system is known in detail, and the business flow chart of the tourism information resource digitization system is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe system resources mainly include scenic spot information, accommodation information, restaurant information, and traffic information.2.2.1.

Traffic ResourcesTraffic information includes bus resources, train resources, aircraft resources, and other related information, as well as sightseeing bus in the scenic spots of tourism enterprises.2.3. Machine Learning-Based Tourism Information Resource Management PlatformTourism information resource management platform is the creation, collection, exchange and implementation of tourism information resources and the knowledge exchange and sharing between tourism subjects and objects so as to achieve the purpose of user interaction.

"it provides the right information and knowledge to the right people at the right time to increase the value of this information. The introduction of machine learning technology into the integrated tourism information resource management platform can enable employees to generate knowledge, update and maintain information in the system, and enable the system to obtain more tourism information resources while the investment of enterprise funds are reduced. At the same time, it can increase the interactivity of the platform and bring better experience to users. The platform is mainly composed of several parts, such as user end, tourism website promotion, tourism information inquiry, and support system, as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.3.1. ClientThe platform of the tourism resource management system covers a wide range, including the staff who run the system, administrative staff, and travel platforms that use the platform to publish information. Among them, platform operators are the biggest contributors to information sources. Customers who use the platform can also interact through the platform, providing valuable related information mining information for the tourism industry [16].2.3.2. Travel Website InterfaceTourism website interface is the entrance to the system platform.

"InterfaceTourism website interface is the entrance to the system platform. On the tourism website, tourism information and resources are presented in a centralized way that is easy for users to understand. Users inside and outside the platform can access this site through intranet and extranet, respectively. For users who have personal interests, they can subscribe by theme and customize their personal information to enter the homepage.2.3.3. Information ServiceInformation service combines the functions of collaboration, communication, learning, and distribution in integrated tourism information management services and is used to integrate extensive information and knowledge inside and outside the system platform. Users can use the full-text search engine to input keywords, search for scenic spot information, and find the scenic spot information they want to know.2.3.4. Support SystemThe system architecture is like a memory bank, which stores platform data, information, and knowledge, and provides a complete system platform interface through the operating system and other servers. Constructing a machine learning-based tourism information resource management platform is crucial to the shortcomings of the existing tourism information resource management platform, as well as the promotion, creation, organization, collection, dissemination, distribution, and implementation of tourism information resources.2.4.

"resource management platform, as well as the promotion, creation, organization, collection, dissemination, distribution, and implementation of tourism information resources.2.4. Data Storage CenterIn order to facilitate the management and use of travel information sources, we should reduce the error rate of network sources and improve the data transmission speed. The storage architecture of each data center adopts LAN architecture, which is an exclusive storage network composed of optical fibers and a cable switch with optical fiber converters. To connect servers and storage devices through storage device management software, many servers share multiple storage devices, as shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe main advantage of using storage architecture is to make full use of optical fiber switches to connect multiple servers and large-capacity storage devices, promote the application of storage architecture, function, and performance, and bring the best open network interface for storage architecture.2.5. Main Algorithms2.5.1. LambdaMART AlgorithmThis paper describes the method of system sorting state, and the document index method is the most effective method applied to model recovery at present, among which LambdaMART is the most important.

"LambdaMART is the most important. Because of the variability of retrieval information options, documents with high relevance are more important than documents with low relevance, so an evaluation index is put forward. Because of the maintenance of these scores, the loss function cannot be increased, and the loss function is optimized with a large slope [17].In the LambdaMART method, the gradient of each sorted data in the search is set as(1)whereλmnrefers to the influence of the sorted documentNon the next round gradient of the documentM, which is(2)where |ΔZmn| is the cost of exchanging the ordering positions of documentMand documentN.The value obtained in formula (1) is applied to the function as a function of the training number, and then the value of the green node of the training tree is calculated according to Newton's method used for direct gradient derivation:(3)Then, use Newton's method(4)Then, update the model as follows:(5)Repeat until the training model reaches the end of training.2.5.2. RankNet MethodRankNet is a pairwise-like algorithm in LTR [18]. In the process of using the search engine, when a keyword is queried, the search engine will find many URLs related to the keyword, then calculate the correlation between the URL and the topic according to the ability of each URL, and determine the order of the last URL.The RankNet algorithm solves the positioning problem in a probabilistic way.

"between the URL and the topic according to the ability of each URL, and determine the order of the last URL.The RankNet algorithm solves the positioning problem in a probabilistic way. First of all, the selection process needs to be considered, that is, when the model attributes are imputed, the \"Score\" command of the model to realize the classification can be output [19,20]. In RankNet, location service is defined as a 3D network model. We input command data related to sample size, output data as interface point, and the selection function is defined as follows:(6)The indices of density parameterWand polarization parameterBrepresent the layer where nodes are located, and the subset represents the number of nodes in the same plane;xikrepresents the return component of vector attributexi, which is the input layer, andf(xi) the result is a score. Then, because RankNet is a sorted training algorithm, the examples are pairwise. For a pairwise ordered training algorithm, there are two kinds that may need to be calculated, one is the prediction of probability, which is given as follows:(7)Its definition is the probability that theith sample comes before thejth sample, wheresmandsnare the result scores of the previous selection function.Another probability is the real probability, which is defined as follows:(8)For a given data command, whereSmn= ∈{0, ±1},Smnis 1, the relevance of themth document is higher than that of thenth document,Smn− 1 indicates that the relevance of themth"
"probability is the real probability, which is defined as follows:(8)For a given data command, whereSmn= ∈{0, ±1},Smnis 1, the relevance of themth document is higher than that of thenth document,Smn− 1 indicates that the relevance of themth document is lower than that of the nth document, andSmn− 0 indicates that the two documents have equal relevance.Then, based on the cross entropy function, the loss function of the RankNet algorithm is established and solved by the gradient descent method as follows:(9)Through simplification, it is concluded that(10)Then, the total cost function of all document pairs is(11)Mrepresents the set of all document pairs, and each document pair contains only once.The loss functionCmntakes the derivative ofwkin the ranking function and then uses the gradient descent method to obtain the best parameters as follows:(12)ηis the step size, and the costcvaries along the negative gradient direction, which is expressed as follows:(13)This shows that updating the parameters along the negative gradient direction can indeed reduce the total cost, and by continuing to decompose (∂C/∂wk), we can get(14)Monly contains a collection of documents with different labels, and each document pair is only contained once. For convenience, we assume thatMonly contains (Um,Un), which means thatUmhas a correlation greater thanUn, that is, all the document pairs inMsatisfySmn= 1, then(15)λmspecifies the transmission direction and the size of themth document in the"
"once. For convenience, we assume thatMonly contains (Um,Un), which means thatUmhas a correlation greater thanUn, that is, all the document pairs inMsatisfySmn= 1, then(15)λmspecifies the transmission direction and the size of themth document in the repetition. The smaller the cover, the more documents behindUm, which increases the gradient of the forward movement ofUminformation documents (actually, more negative documents ofλm). This shows that the direction and intensity of the next line of each information document depend on all other documents with different symbols in the same document.The RankNet algorithm makes use of the relationship between sample pairs in the training process, especially in the prediction probability part, so it is a two-way method.2.5.3. GBDT AlgorithmGBDT is a combination of AdaBoost and deadtree. AdaBoost-DTree is adopted, and gradient adjustment is used for training. Since AdaBoost-DTree, the decision has been used for weight test training, so it is necessary to reconfigure the decision. The sample sizes of different weights in the new system are balanced, and the decision configuration is not needed to train the recently designed model using decision [21].In AdaBoost, the gradient weight of each information is calculated as, wherefis the error rate of the information document in the sample. Then, the formula for calculating the gradient weight of each sample in thef+ 1 round is(16)where Δfis, then it is concluded that(17)That is, the final"

Then, the formula for calculating the gradient weight of each sample in thef+ 1 round is(16)where Δfis, then it is concluded that(17)That is, the final model is. According to this formula and the calculation formula (yn· (WFΦ(Xn) +b/‖W‖) of margin in SVM, the smaller the margin in SVM, the better the model effect. The purpose of this method is to find the smallest, that is,.Next, we have to find the best learning rateη, namely(18)That is, by finding the bestη, the algorithm can makeηgf(Xf) and the output of the information document close to the residual error of the actual sample label value to the greatest extent.2.5.4. LambdaMARTThe slope obtained above is applied to GBDT as a function of training numbers, and then the green node value of the training tree is calculated according to Newton's method used to get the template [22,23]as follows:(19)Then, use Newton's method(20), where the model is then updated as follows:(21)Iterate and loop in turn until the training model reaches the standard of training termination.3.

In the off-season (March and April) and the peak season (August and September), the digital management of information resources was carried out, and the number of tourists, expenditure of scenic spots, income of scenic spots, and tourists' satisfaction were investigated, respectively. After the investigation, compared with previous years, it analyzes the impact of digital management system of information resources on all aspects of scenic spots.3.2.

"system based on machine learning is established. Finally, the digital system of tourism information resources is applied to scenic spots, all aspects of which are tested, and the research on digital management and optimization of tourism information resources based on machine learning is completed. There are still some shortcomings, such as too little data collection, and all of them are large scenic spots, so there may be experimental errors, and the small scenic spots have not been tested. Further research and exploration are needed.5. ConclusionsAt present, the informatization of tourism resources is not enough to promote the development of the tourism industry. Machine learning, as the mainstream technology of artificial intelligence, can be applied to the digital tourism information system, which can promote the development of scenic spots. In this paper, machine learning technology was applied to the digital system of tourism information resources, and the number of tourists, expenditure, income, and satisfaction of tourists in different scenic spots were investigated. It is found that the digital tourism information system can attract more tourists, reduce the expenditure, and increase the income of scenic spots, and tourists are more satisfied with the use of the digital tourism information system.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation"

IntroductionWith the development of medical technology, major hospitals have begun to record patients' personal health information in electronic medical records (EMRs) and connect the EMRs to the Internet. The EMRs store a lot of private information about patients' personal health, such as diagnosis and medication, and face a high risk of information leakage.

"and medication, and face a high risk of information leakage. Traditionally, the EMRs are stored in a centralized manner. The centralized storage makes it hard to share patients' personal health information and increases the proneness to cyberattacks. The resulting problems include data leakage, data loss, and EMR misplacement [1-3]. A series of security threats arise for EMR information. Therefore, the security of EMR usage is an urgent problem to be solved in the sharing and storage of medical information. In recent years, blockchain and cloud storage gradually enter the medical field. Many EMR storage systems no longer give patients the full control of health information [4,5]. However, there are still some malicious behaviors in cloud servers, and the security management of EMRs in cloud storage poses an urgent problem to be solved.Traditional EMR sharing platforms lack effective privacy protection schemes [6-8]. Xanthidis and Xanthidou [9] designed an error-correcting code hash function and constructed an anonymization algorithm for privacy protection, which effectively controls the access rights of other users, while ensuring the safe sharing of data between patients and doctors. Ma et al. [10] proposed an authentication mechanism and authorized access mechanism for the users who make access requests and effectively solved the patients' control of EMR data and the authorized access to EMR data.EMRs need to be shared and transmitted in different formats from traditional"
"mechanism and authorized access mechanism for the users who make access requests and effectively solved the patients' control of EMR data and the authorized access to EMR data.EMRs need to be shared and transmitted in different formats from traditional structured data, because they contain lots of contents about the health and privacy of patients [11-13]. Responding to the classification and protection requirements of privacy-sensitive information in EMRs, Blondon and Ehrler [14] proposed a recognition and classification algorithm for medical terms that represent patient health-sensitive information in EMR texts and performed selective encryption and confidential search of the recognized words. Kim et al. [15] constructed an EMR management system based on the browser/server (B/S) architecture. The system realizes various functions: batch entry of massive medical records, multicondition query of complex EMRs, standard full-text query, and classified statistical analysis on EMRs of different years and types, providing support to the information sharing of EMRs.The design of the consensus mechanism is the key to ensure the security of medical data in the EMR management system [16-18]. Kawser and Nyeem [19] proposed a dynamic mode Byzantine fault-tolerant (DMBFT) consensus mechanism, which applies aggregate signatures to the consensus process and optimizes the single mode of the consensus mechanism to a dynamic mode.

In this way, the efficiency of signature verification is effectively improved.The previous studies have presented solutions to the access control, storage system design, and information sharing from different angles [20-26]. However, their protection measures for patient privacy cannot cope with the fast-developing password cracking technologies and frequent cyberattacks. To solve the problems, this paper takes electronic nursing records (ENRs), which involves many people, for example, and tries to innovate the information sharing and privacy protection of ENR management system.

Certificateless Signature Interception Scheme for ENRsAs an important part of medical big data, EMRs involve a lot of private information of patients, which should be protected according to laws. Compared with EMRs, ENRs involve a lot of people, including the responsible doctors, as well as the responsible nurses in different shifts. To conceal the sensitive parts of EMRs and protect the privacy of patients (e.g., basic information, type of disease, and state of disease), this paper applies the signature interception scheme to the information confirmation in the ENR scenario in Figure1, laying the basis for blockchain-based ENR information sharing and security management.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointApplication of signature interception in ENR scenario.2.1. Phase DescriptionBased on the certificateless public key cryptosystem, this paper designs an efficient certificateless signature interception scheme, which consists of eight phases:Phase 1: management system initialization. LetSTibe the serial numberSTiof identity authentication for patientVi. The management system can be initialized in the following steps:Step 1: the key generation center randomly selects an l-bit prime numberw, creating a set {Gw,R/Gw,H1,O}, whereGwis a finite field;R/Gwis an elliptic curve onGw;H1is the additive group;wis the order;Ois the generator.Step 2:"

To sign his/her name on ENR informationN= {nl,n2,...,nm}, patientVineeds to go through the following four steps:Step 1: first, calculate the hash valuefi1=F1(ni||CIA) of each subsegmentni(i∈[l,nm]) in N of the content interception and access (CIA) structure. Then, cascadefi1subsegments by the serial numberifrom 1 tom, producing the hashed valueN'=F2·(F1(n1||CIA)·F1(n2||CIA),...,F1(nm||CIA)).Step 2: randomly selectbi∈ℝC∗w, and computeBi=biO.Step 3: computegi=F3(N′,STi,Bi,Si), andτi=F4(N′,STi,Bi,Oi).Step 4: computeεi=bi− (τi·ai+gi·ci)modw. Ifεi= 0, return to Step 1; otherwise, generate the global signatureεG= (CIA,εi,Bi).Phase 7: signature interception. The interceptor should intercept the global signatureεGafter the signature passes the validity test.

Sincegi=F3(N′,STi,Bi,Si),τi=F4(N′,STi,Bi,Oi),Bi=biO,Oi=aiO,Si=siO, andOSPK=eO, the equation can be verified through the following derivation:(4)The proposed certificateless signature interception scheme was proved correct through the above two steps.3.

Traditionally, the data sharing of ENR management system depends too much on the centralized mechanism. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an ENR information sharing protocol based on alliance blockchain. The protocol contains a total of six phases.Phase 1: system initialization.

"Similar to the preceding section, the system administrator needs to initialize the system in the following steps:Step 1: letwbe a large prime number. The system administrator chooses an elliptic curve on a finite field. The order formed by the points on the curve is denoted asw, and the additive group with the generator O is denoted asH1.Step 2: the system administrator selectse∈ℝC∗was the master key MK, and computesOSPK=e·Oas the public key of the system.Step 3: the system administrator chooses hash functionsF0,F1,F2,F3, andF4:(5)Step 4: the system administrator publicizes system parameterSP= {Gw,R/Gw,H1,O,OSPK,F0,F1,F2,F3,F4}, and stores the master keyesecretly.Phase 2: system registration. The system is registered in three steps:Step 1: the ENR creator registers at the system administrator:(a)The ENR creator (doctor or nurse) selects a random numberac∈ℝC∗was its secret value, computesOc=ac`O, and transmits its identitySTcand part of the public keyOcto the system administrator, as a preparatory work of registration.(b)Upon receiving theSTcandOcfrom the ENR creator, the system administrator randomly selectsec∈ℝC∗w, computesSc=sc·Ofc=F0(STi,Si,Oi), andci=si+e·fc, and securely transmits part of the private keyCRc= (cc,Sc) to the ENR creator.(c)The ENR creator verifies ifccO=Sc+F0(STc,Sc,Oc)OSPKis valid.

The patient selects a random numberav∈ℝC∗w, configures the private keyPUv=av, and computes the public keyGUv=avO. Then, he/she transmits his/her identitySTvand public keyGUvto MMSAC via safe channels.Step 3: the patient registers at MMSAC. MMSAC authenticates the identity and role of the patient and issues a real-name registration certificate to the patientRNRCv= (STv,GUv,SIPU), whereSIPUis the signature set by MMSAC for the public keySTvof the patient, using its own private key. Figure3shows the registration flow of the ENR management system.Phase 3: ENR creation. This paper signs ENRs following the certificateless signature interception scheme. The ENR creator needs to execute the following operations:Step 1: compute the hash valuesF1(ni||CIA) of the ten subsegmentsni(i∈ [1, 11]) of the patient (e.g., name, gender, age, contact number, identity card number, condition description, medical history, diagnosis, treatment and medication, imaging data, and nursing conditions).

After receiving theinfofrom the ENR creator, the patient decrypts the ciphertextRGUo(Lc) with the private keyPUoto obtainSLc. Then, the patient solves EMR information N based onSLc. Finally, the patient verifies the ENR signature. There are two specific steps in this phase:Step 1: computefN∗=F1(ni||CIA), and verify iffN∗is consistent withfN.

Let CT andτbe the position and timestamp of the encrypted ENR data of the patient being stored in the cloud, respectively. The cyphertexts of CT andτand other transaction data TD (e.g., hash values and signatures) are attached to the deployed chain code, which contains the access control list (ACL) and algebraic logic function (ALF), and the chain code is then broadcasted across the network. LetTPoibe the patient's alias for transaction, and let HD be the anonymous transaction certificate. The issuance process can be described by(10)where(11)In the blockchain, each transaction initiated by a node carries a signature, which the node signs to verify the validity of the transaction.

In a channel, if another userVwants to access the ENR of patient O, the access control and effective sharing of the relevant data can be realized by calling the transaction chain code deployed by consensus node for patient O. This phase requires three operations:Step 1: the other user sends a nursing data access request AC, including the object ST, purpose VP, and visit time VT, to the management system:(12)Step 2: after consensus node receives the access request, the chain codeCCoverifies whether the identitySTgof the requestor exists in the ACL preset by patientSTo. If not, the requestor is not authenticated by the patient. Then,CCorefuse to execute any operation and send a rejection notice to the requestor. If yes,CCowill start to execute the corresponding ALF. First, compute the storage location index CT of the shareable metadata of patient O according to his/her alias private keyPUTPo. Then, encrypt the CT based on the public keyGUvof the requestor V.

To judge if the EMR of patient O is complete and effective, it is necessary to verify the consistency betweenfN∗andfNin CD and then examine iffN∗equals the hash value of the intercepted EMRN'.

The network can accept semistructured and nonstructured data, including medical terms and medical texts and classify ENR information through correlation analysis.The end-to-end memory neural network receives the basic information entryA= {a1,a2,...,am} of the ENR to be classified. Passing through word vector matricesQand W, A can be transformed into an input memory unit (13) and an output memory unit (14):(14)LetXandYbe the number of medical terms and the dimension of the corresponding word vectors in the entire ENR dataset, respectively. Then,Qand W areX∗Y-dimensional matrices obeying Gaussian distribution.

In this process, the basic information of each ENR class being inputted can be expressed as a matrix of memory units.For embedded representation of the ENR, a word vector matrixP∈ℝX∗Ywas defined, which also obeys Gaussian distribution.

"Meanwhile, our scheme effectively reduces the utilization rate of computer resources and guarantees system stability. The ENR accesses are restricted by the alliance blockchain and improved hash algorithm, laying the basis for privacy protection. Before storing the ENR, the anonymization algorithm for privacy protection is introduced to process the sensitive information in the ENR, which the patient wants to hide, thereby realizing safe storage.

Since the consensus is reached between the patient and the doctor/nurse, the proposed EMR information sharing scheme saved more than 5 times the time in confirming data blocks, and transmitted data with 79.45% higher efficiency than the traditional blockchain (Figure9). With the number of blocks to be confirmed, the confirmation times of our method and traditional blockchain were both on the rise.

The improved algorithm is more suitable to ENR management system. Figure10shows the CPU occupancies of the adopted consensus mechanism. From the CPU occupancy curves, it can be observed that, with the elapse of time, the CPU occupancy of the improved consensus algorithm was much smaller than that of the original algorithm. Hence, our consensus algorithm can respond to access requests more rapidly.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointCPU occupancies of original and improved consensus algorithms.6.

Specifically, the certificateless signature interception scheme was depicted phase by phase, and the validation procedures of the scheme were designed. Next, the six phases of ENR information sharing protocol based on alliance blockchain were described in detail. Afterwards, end-to-end memory neural network was constructed for ENR classification. The proposed management scheme was proved superior through experimental results on the runtime of each phase. Besides, the time consumption of one-by-one verification was compared with that of aggregate verification, suggesting that our consensus algorithm has a streamlined consensus process and supports the fast connection, rapid synchronization, and effectives haring between ENR nodes. In addition, our EMR information sharing scheme was compared with three existing information sharing schemes.

"AbstractNitrogen (N) deposition is a key component of global change. In order to predict the consequences of those changes, the spatial and temporal patterns of N deposition need to be quantified. We investigated patterns of inorganic-N deposition across two spatial scales--regional and local--in six oak savanna sites across north-central California during the 2008-2009 wet season. We found a regional-scale deposition gradient in which sites closer to urban and agricultural sources received higher rates of deposition than more remote sites. Additionally, sites closer to urban sources received a greater proportion of N as NO3−-N. At the local, within-site scale, canopy understories received greater N inputs compared to the adjacent open grassland. Temporal heterogeneity in N deposition was also found. Deposition exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, corresponding to the distinct wet-dry cycles characteristic of this Mediterranean ecosystem. While these spatial and temporal results were expected, it was surprising that the magnitude of the hotspot effect under oaks changed across the regional gradient. At the high deposition end of the regional gradient proportionally more N was received beneath canopies than at the low end of the gradient. This nonlinearity between local and regional scales demonstrates the importance of landscape context for understanding within-site dynamics and the need for multi-scalar research approaches.

"the gradient. This nonlinearity between local and regional scales demonstrates the importance of landscape context for understanding within-site dynamics and the need for multi-scalar research approaches. Incorporating regional-scale landscape context and local-scale vegetation structure, as well as temporal variability, into our understanding of deposition patterns is crucial for monitoring efforts as well as addressing potential ecological effects of increased N deposition.IntroductionNitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. However, human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion and fertilizer use, may add N to ecosystems at levels to which plants are not adapted. As a consequence, N deposition is increasingly viewed as an input of concern (Vitousek et al. 1997). Atmospheric deposition can add N-containing gases and particles to ecosystems in wet form (i.e., precipitation or fog) or dry form (i.e., gravitational settling or sedimentation). This deposition of N is not homogeneous across the landscape, but rather is heterogeneous in both space and time (Fenn et al. 2003). It is unknown how these spatial and temporal patterns manifest across scales. Many important ecosystem processes exhibit nonlinearities across spatial and temporal scales, making it difficult to scale up or down when making predictions (Peters et al. 2007).

"nonlinearities across spatial and temporal scales, making it difficult to scale up or down when making predictions (Peters et al. 2007). Forecasting ecological responses to enhanced N input to ecosystems requires an understanding of mechanisms affecting deposition across scales. To accomplish this, studies of deposition patterns must encompass a large spatial extent and also capture the effects of finer scale heterogeneity.The heterogeneous vegetation structure and broad regional extent of the California oak savanna provide a unique opportunity to examine spatial and temporal patterns of N deposition across multiple scales. The oak savanna covers 4 million hectares, approximately 10% of the land area in California (Allen-Diaz et al. 2007). It is valuable grazing land and filters two thirds of the state's drinking water (FRRAP 1988). The region, in general, receives low rates of ambient N deposition ranging from 1 to 5 kg N·ha−1·yr−1, with hotspots of high deposition near urban and agricultural centers ranging from 30 to 70 kg N·ha−1·yr−1(Fenn et al. 2010).Both regional- and local-scale landscape features may drive N deposition patterns. California's oak savannas are increasingly located adjacent to human-dominated landscapes (Gaman and Firman 2006). At a regional scale, land use, such as agricultural or urban, dictates the form and amount of emissions transported and deposited in adjacent sites.

"(Gaman and Firman 2006). At a regional scale, land use, such as agricultural or urban, dictates the form and amount of emissions transported and deposited in adjacent sites. Oak savannas surround the intensive agricultural region of the Great Central Valley, a statewide hotspot for N emissions (Tonnesen et al. 2007), and urbanization is a continual threat. Adjacent land use patterns may also influence the chemical form of N emissions. Emissions from agricultural activities, such as fertilizer use and animal feedlots, are typically NH3. Urban activities, such as vehicle use, result in greater emissions of NOxgases (Fenn et al. 2003), although NH3emissions are increasing in California cities due to adoption of catalytic converters in vehicles (Bishop et al. 2010). Thus, oak savannas may receive varying amounts and proportions of different kinds of N deposition depending on adjacent land use, creating an indirect regional gradient in deposition.Regional-scale features may, in turn, influence local, within-site processes. At a local scale, heterogeneity in vegetation structure influences where N is deposited. Structural discontinuities, such as forest edges, can be hotspots for atmospheric N deposition (Draaijers et al. 1988) because they disrupt air flow, causing gases and particles to settle on leaf surfaces during dry periods and then rinse off during rainfall events (Weathers et al. 2001). Solitary oaks embedded in open grassland may play the same structural role as forest"
"because they disrupt air flow, causing gases and particles to settle on leaf surfaces during dry periods and then rinse off during rainfall events (Weathers et al. 2001). Solitary oaks embedded in open grassland may play the same structural role as forest edges--hotspots of atmospheric deposition. Oak canopy cover is sparse at less than 30%, indicating that each individual tree has the potential to disrupt air flow across the open grassland and receive increased deposition. Increased soil nutrients surrounding savanna trees, termed islands of fertility, has long been recognized as a general feature of savannas (Kellman 1979,Dahlgren et al. 1997), and atmospheric deposition has more recently been identified as a key mechanism responsible for creating and maintaining these islands (Perakis and Kellogg 2007).The chemical and physical processes that control deposition also vary seasonally, leading to temporal heterogeneity in N deposition. Some temporal heterogeneity may be due to changes in the human activities that produce emissions, such as decreased travel on weekends (Marr and Harley 2002). Other factors include seasonal weather patterns that trap polluted air, changes in vegetated surfaces that adhere gases and particles, and photochemical reactions controlled by temperature and humidity that produce gases and particles that are readily deposited (Bytnerowicz and Fenn 1996).

"and photochemical reactions controlled by temperature and humidity that produce gases and particles that are readily deposited (Bytnerowicz and Fenn 1996). In the oak savanna, the Mediterranean climate produces distinct wet-dry seasons. This strong seasonality in precipitation causes pulses of deposition to the ground layer that occurs with the first rain events of the wet season (Callaway and Nadkarni 1991).Regional- and local-scale deposition patterns have been examined separately, for example, in regional air quality models (Tonnesen et al. 2007) and plot or site-based measurements of deposition (Callaway and Nadkarni 1991). Integrating results across these two scales will determine how a local-scale deposition hotspot beneath individual canopies changes across a regional-scale deposition gradient. This research goes beyond previous studies on deposition in savanna ecosystems to examine this cross-scale linkage. An integrated, multi-scale view of N deposition can improve our ability to predict its effects and effectively target local policy and management efforts for these wide-ranging ecosystems. Thus, to study a cross-scale dynamic, we quantified the deposition hotspot under oak canopies across the region during the 2008-2009 wet season. This enabled us to address the following objectives: determine the role of the canopy deposition hotspot on (1) the total amount and (2) the chemical form of N in deposition to the ground layer across a regional deposition gradient"
"2008-2009 wet season. This enabled us to address the following objectives: determine the role of the canopy deposition hotspot on (1) the total amount and (2) the chemical form of N in deposition to the ground layer across a regional deposition gradient within the wet season. We predicted that (1) the regional landscape context would interact with the local canopy deposition hotspot to produce different patterns in the amount and form of deposition beneath trees at each site along the gradient and (2) the chemical form of N input would differ across the region based on proximity to emission sources and type of emission.MethodsSite descriptionThe California oak savanna is a transition zone between grassland and oak woodland, and is primarily located in the foothills of north-central California. Vegetation structure is a mostly annual grass ground layer interspersed with sparse oak trees (Allen-Diaz et al. 2007). The climate is Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Average annual temperature and precipitation ranges from 13° to 18°C and from 30 to 100 cm, respectively (Bailey 1980). Dry deposition is dominant; wet deposition can be as small as 5-10% of the total (Bytnerowicz and Fenn 1996).Six sites were selected to represent a regional gradient of N deposition.

"selected to represent a regional gradient of N deposition. The gradient was acquired by the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, a photochemical grid model that uses meteorological and emissions inventory data from 2002, combined with chemical speciation and deposition algorithms, to calculate N deposition rates in 4 km grid cells across most of California (Tonnesen et al. 2007). Using the predictions from this model, sites were selected in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges. Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) and McLaughlin Reserve (MCL) had low estimated deposition, Bobcat Ranch (BOB) and San Francisco Water (SFW) had medium, and San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) and Sierra Foothills Research and Extension Center (SFREC) had high estimated deposition rates (Fig. 1,Table 1).Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSix oak savanna study sites.

Because of topographic variability at the regional scale, slope aspect varied across sites. Study trees were at top- or mid-slope with slope angles ranging from 0 to 30%. Trees with a single, distinct canopy of at least 5 m in diameter were selected.The six study sites are each located within unique landscape and environmental contexts (Table 1). Sites were selected in locations adjacent to urban areas, intensive agriculture, and remote areas to provide a mix of N sources. Hopland REC and MCL are in the Coast Range and are remote--not near intensive agricultural land or urban areas. Bobcat Ranch and SFREC are in the foothills of the Coast Range and Sierra Nevada Mountains, respectively. They are both near intensive agriculture in the Central Valley. The San Francisco Water property, in the East Bay hills, is embedded in an urban area and represents the highest end of an urbanization gradient across sites. An 8-lane interstate highway and a gravel pit are both less than 2 km from the sampling areas. San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) is in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills.

"from the sampling areas. San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) is in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills. This site is near intensive agriculture in the Central Valley and a large urban center, Fresno, is 30 km south.Data collectionWe used ion-exchange resin (IER) columns to quantify inorganic N deposition in throughfall beneath oaks and in bulk deposition to the adjacent open grassland, respectively. We did not attempt to quantify total deposition or complete a N budget, but rather focused on a technique that would allow us to quantify inorganic N inputs to the ground layer. The IER method is a passive deposition collection technique, dependent on rainfall, which integrates inorganic inputs over the course of a pre-determined sampling period (Fenn and Poth 2004). Precipitation passes through IER columns and inorganic N molecules bind to the resin and are extracted in the lab. This method was ideally suited for this regional-scale study because it integrated multiple sources of deposition (dry and wet) into a single measure and did not require collection of individual rain events. The drawbacks of the IER method are that dry deposited, wet deposited, fog deposited, and canopy processed N (e.g., leaf leachate, contamination from insect frass) cannot be readily distinguished from one another and some N could have come from dissolved organic matter that mineralized and bound to resin during the collection period.The IER columns were constructed using a 25 cm long PVC tube"
"from insect frass) cannot be readily distinguished from one another and some N could have come from dissolved organic matter that mineralized and bound to resin during the collection period.The IER columns were constructed using a 25 cm long PVC tube (1.25 cm inner diameter) filled with 45 g of Amberlite mixed-bed resin and topped with filter fiber to prevent organic matter from entering the column (Fenn and Poth 2004). Ion-exchange resin columns were attached to 25 cm diameter funnels and covered with an outer PVC shell to minimize temperature fluctuations. Funnels were equipped with drain discs to prevent clogging and rimmed with wire spikes and reflective streamers to prevent birds from perching. Despite these precautions, approximately 5% of collectors were contaminated by birds. Collectors were inspected visually for signs of animal activity and these samples were dropped due to contamination. When no activity was apparent, but deposition rates from samples were an order of magnitude higher than other samples and similar to samples with known contamination, these samples were also considered contaminated and dropped from the analysis.Within each site, five trees were selected for the study. Under the canopy of each of those trees, four throughfall collectors were positioned at the midpoint between the stem and canopy dripline: directly uphill, downhill, and to either side of the stem. Thus, each site had five replicate trees with four subsamples per tree. In addition,"
"those trees, four throughfall collectors were positioned at the midpoint between the stem and canopy dripline: directly uphill, downhill, and to either side of the stem. Thus, each site had five replicate trees with four subsamples per tree. In addition, five bulk deposition collectors were located in the adjacent open grassland at a distance away from the nearest tree equivalent to at least two tree heights. No subsampling was included for the bulk deposition collectors because deposition is expected to be much more homogeneous in open grassland compared to under a tree canopy (Lovett and Lindberg 1993).Ion-exchange resin columns were collected and replaced in the field every six weeks during the wet season (October-May). Ion-exchange resin columns were not exposed during the summer dry season (June-September) because even though atmospheric deposition rates can be high (Bytnerowicz and Fenn 1996), throughfall/bulk deposition N inputs at this time are negligible due to the lack of precipitation. In the lab, the IER columns were flushed with 2 M KCl solution to extract the deposited ions. One hundred milliliters of 2 M KCl was added to the column and allowed to soak for 20 minutes before slowly draining (Fenn and Poth 2004). This was repeated twice more and sequential extracts were bulked and weighed to determine extract volume. An extraction efficiency test was performed that determined 300 ml of 2 M KCl removed between 90 and 95% of deposited ions. Subsamples of extract"
"This was repeated twice more and sequential extracts were bulked and weighed to determine extract volume. An extraction efficiency test was performed that determined 300 ml of 2 M KCl removed between 90 and 95% of deposited ions. Subsamples of extract solution were frozen and stored before analysis. The extract solution was analyzed for NO3−-N and NH4+-N colorimetrically using a single reagent method for NO3−-N (Doane and Horwath 2003) and the salicylate method for NH4+-N (Verdouw et al. 1978). Extract volume, funnel surface area, and exposure time were used to calculate a deposition rate (kg N·ha−1·yr−1).Data analysisResults from ion exchange resin columns beneath canopies were first analyzed using ANOVA to determine whether there were significant differences among individual subsamples under a single canopy. This would indicate directionality in deposition. Higher deposition to downhill collectors would be expected given prevailing winds in sloped habitats, and we expected directionality to be consistent within a site but vary across sites. Therefore, we ran separate single factor ANOVAs for each site using understory location (uphill, downhill, etc.) as the independent variable. No significant differences in deposition rate were found for collectors under the same tree canopy, indicating no effect of directionality on deposition (P> 0.05 for all comparisons).

Based on this result, we did not consider heterogeneity in deposition at the within-canopy scale, and we bulked within-canopy extract samples prior to analysis to obtain an average deposition rate by canopy.Differences in N deposition between the open grassland and the tree understory across the regional gradient were analyzed using linear mixed effects analysis in R (version 3.1.0) using the nlme package (Pinheiro et al. 2014). Nitrogen deposition was log-transformed and shifted 0.5 units to meet homogeneity of variance assumptions. Transformed N deposition was modeled as a function of landscape position (open vs. canopy), N deposition estimates for the entire site from the CMAQ model (Tonnesen et al. 2007), precipitation, and sampling date. Total deposition values (wet plus dry) from grid cells in the CMAQ model that contained the sampling area within each study site were used as the site estimates in the analysis. Position, CMAQ estimates, precipitation, and date served as fixed effects and site as a random effect in the model. The CMAQ estimate is the predictor variable for site-level N deposition because it allows a direct test of the a priori hypothesis of a gradient in N deposition across sites. The random variable, Site, accounts for variation in N deposition attributable to the site, but not contained in the CMAQ estimate"
"N deposition because it allows a direct test of the a priori hypothesis of a gradient in N deposition across sites. The random variable, Site, accounts for variation in N deposition attributable to the site, but not contained in the CMAQ estimate (e.g., an unknown, nearby emission source).The proportion of deposition as NO3−-N was analyzed with linear mixed effects modeling to determine whether proximity to urban centers influences the form of N deposited. Urban centers were defined as metropolitan areas with a population of at least 40,000. Distance from sites to the nearest urban center was determined using a centroid-based nearest neighbor approach in GIS. Distance was used as the predictor variable, along with position and date. Wind pattern was not considered in the distance measurement, but prevailing winds in California generally flow across the valley floor where urban centers are located to the foothill sites during the spring, summer, and fall. A winter inversion often traps polluted air in the valleys (Hayes et al. 1984).ResultsResults showed a significant increase in N deposition across sites along the gradient following the CMAQ model estimates (Fig. 2,Table 2). Mean site deposition, obtained from a simple average of deposition both beneath the canopy and in the open, ranged from a low of 2.5 kg N·ha−1·yr−1at HREC to a high of 8.5 kg N·ha−1·yr−1at SJER.

"of deposition both beneath the canopy and in the open, ranged from a low of 2.5 kg N·ha−1·yr−1at HREC to a high of 8.5 kg N·ha−1·yr−1at SJER. CMAQ estimates closely followed this average site deposition rate. The actual values quantified for deposition under the canopy, however, were substantially higher than CMAQ estimates. The canopy understory received significantly greater deposition than the surrounding open area at all sites (Table 2). In contrast, deposition to the open grassland was slightly lower than CMAQ estimates. The interaction between CMAQ estimates and position (canopy vs. open) was statistically significant. Sites at the high end of the deposition gradient exhibited a greater difference in deposition between canopy and open positions compared to sites at the low end of the gradient (Fig. 2). Thus, there was a stronger deposition hotspot effect beneath oak trees at sites with higher background deposition rates than sites with lower background deposition rates.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointTotal inorganic N deposition (NO3−-N + NH4+-N) quantified from throughfall beneath oak canopies and bulk deposition in the adjacent open grassland as a function of CMAQ model estimates for study sites.

The random effect site accounts for variance at the site level not attributable to the CMAQ estimates. A separate t-test is performed for each level of categorical variables (not shown). A type III test shows overall statistical significance of each model factor.The effect of sample date on inorganic N deposition was also significant with the greatest deposition occurring in the late fall (31 October-11 December) and late winter (22 January-4 March). This created a bimodal pattern in deposition across the year that was consistent across sites (Fig. 3). The late fall peak corresponded to the first major rain event following a period of prolonged dry conditions. The late winter peak corresponded to a large storm event. The lowest deposition occurred in the early fall (15 September-30 October) prior to the start of the first significant rain event of the wet season. Low deposition to the ground layer in the early fall is most likely due to the precipitation amount being insufficient to rinse dry deposited N into the IER columns (Fig. 3). Although storms and rainy conditions continued throughout the winter, deposition levels declined in January.

This is highlighted by the nonlinear nature of the deposition hotspot across a regional gradient. Regional-scale deposition was well-matched to CMAQ air quality model estimates. These estimates may be useful in explaining broad ecosystem patterns and processes, but fine-scale predictions are also important.

"quality model estimates. These estimates may be useful in explaining broad ecosystem patterns and processes, but fine-scale predictions are also important. Deposition that occurs at a finer scale could be important to organisms that live and interact at that scale. For example, understory plant communities experience much greater N inputs than those growing a short distance away in the open grassland.Regional and local scale interactionsOur results illustrate the importance of multi-scale interactions in characterizing ecosystem dynamics. At the local scale, we found the tree canopy in this semi-arid, dry deposition-dominated ecosystem plays a significant role in concentrating deposition, but canopies do not perform this function linearly across a regional-scale gradient of deposition levels. Instead, the canopy concentrates proportionally more N at sites with higher mean N deposition. One explanation for this nonlinearity may be the precipitation gradient across sites and the concomitant shift in dominance of wet versus dry deposition. The canopy likely has a stronger hotspot effect in areas with low precipitation and high dry deposition because the longer dry periods allow more time for N to accumulate on canopy surfaces. In contrast, wetter sites have shorter rain-free periods giving the canopy less time to accumulate dry deposited N. In our system, high deposition sites are also low precipitation sites (Table 1) meaning they receive a greater proportion of total"
"In contrast, wetter sites have shorter rain-free periods giving the canopy less time to accumulate dry deposited N. In our system, high deposition sites are also low precipitation sites (Table 1) meaning they receive a greater proportion of total deposition as dry deposition. Low deposition sites also receive greater precipitation and therefore, proportionally more wet deposition. Thus, the magnitude of the deposition hotspot, or the difference between understory and open areas within a particular site, is greater at low precipitation, high mean deposition sites. A relationship between the strength of nutrient hotspots around trees/shrubs and the dominance of dry deposition processes may be present in many savanna systems with strongly seasonal climates. Further research is needed to separate the contributions of wet and dry deposition across the regional gradient.Interactions between local and regional dynamics influenced not only the amount of N deposition, but also its chemical form. Nitrogen deposition in sites closer to urban areas contained a significantly greater proportion as NO3−-N compared to rural, remote sites. Sites closer to intensive agricultural areas had greater proportions of NH4+-N. At the local, within-site scale, chemical form may depend on landscape position and the amount of N deposition. At the lowest deposition site, percent NO3−-N was lower in under canopy deposition compared to open. This is likely a signal of canopy uptake of NO3−-N, noted in"
"scale, chemical form may depend on landscape position and the amount of N deposition. At the lowest deposition site, percent NO3−-N was lower in under canopy deposition compared to open. This is likely a signal of canopy uptake of NO3−-N, noted in other throughfall studies (Klopatek et al. 2006). That a canopy uptake signal was observed only at the lowest deposition site suggests that higher deposition levels at the other study sites may be saturating the canopy uptake process and allowing more NO3−-N to reach the ground layer.Temporal dynamicsDeposition had a strong seasonal pattern as indicated by the significance of sample date in all analyses. Low deposition in the 15 September-30 October collection period was likely caused by insufficient rainfall to rinse accumulated dry deposition from surfaces. How much rainfall is needed to rinse leaves of accumulated deposited dry deposition is unknown, however, for this system a large peak in 31 October-11 December collection period is most likely capturing both the high wet deposition rates from storm events and the first significant rinsing of canopy surfaces following prolonged dry conditions. Also at the start of the wet season, trees still have senescent leaves and these leaves would have increased the deposition surface with minimal N removal through foliar uptake. Although storms and rainy conditions continued throughout the wet season, deposition levels declined in the 12 December-21 January collection period indicating"
"would have increased the deposition surface with minimal N removal through foliar uptake. Although storms and rainy conditions continued throughout the wet season, deposition levels declined in the 12 December-21 January collection period indicating little additional inputs via rinsing of dry deposition from leaf surfaces. Lack of foliage on trees during these winter months may have further reduced canopy deposition, although there was still a strong deposition hotspot under trees. The second peak in the late winter could have been due to wet deposition inputs from a large storm. A peak of accumulated dry deposition is not as likely given the precipitation that occurred prior to the storm. Trees were leafless at this time, but beginning to grow new buds. The chemical form of deposition also exhibited temporal heterogeneity in which the proportion of NO3−-N decreased over the course of the year, with the steepest decline under canopies. The temporal pattern is caused by lower rates of photochemical reactions producing HNO3in the warmer spring months. This reduction in NO3−-N may also be partly explained by the deciduous nature of the oaks wherein canopy uptake of NO3−-N increases as oaks leaf out and become biologically active later in the wet season.Temporal heterogeneity in deposition has implications for the timing of nutrient cycling and plant activity. The fall peak coincides with germination and early growth in this annual-dominated plant community (Bartolome 1979). In"
"later in the wet season.Temporal heterogeneity in deposition has implications for the timing of nutrient cycling and plant activity. The fall peak coincides with germination and early growth in this annual-dominated plant community (Bartolome 1979). In addition, N deposition may interact with changes to precipitation due to global change to alter water availability as well as the timing and amount of available nutrients. In these temporally heterogeneous landscapes, it will be crucial to understand how N deposition affects plant communities over the course of the entire growing season and to identify specific life stages that may be particularly sensitive to N deposition.Model comparisonWhile we did not intend to validate the CMAQ model, our results are a reminder that both regional (e.g., precipitation patterns) and local (e.g., vegetation structure) spatial heterogeneity are important in determining patterns of deposition. The CMAQ model provides an estimate for both wet and dry deposition, but it likely underestimates dry deposition to the oak canopy. At the same time, our bulk deposition collectors in the open likely underestimated dry deposition, the result being that bulk deposition results most closely match CMAQ estimates at HREC, the site with the highest precipitation and contribution of wet deposition. In addition, the model averages vegetation cover to obtain a regional-level deposition estimate. However, in a structurally heterogeneous habitat the average may"
"at HREC, the site with the highest precipitation and contribution of wet deposition. In addition, the model averages vegetation cover to obtain a regional-level deposition estimate. However, in a structurally heterogeneous habitat the average may not be representative of deposition at any one location within that habitat. This fine-scale heterogeneity is often the relevant scale at which many ecological processes occur. For example, species sorting at the local scale between oak understory and open grassland environments has been documented (Jackson et al. 1990). Increased deposition to the oak canopy may partly explain these patterns. Although deposition rates are low, chronic deposition can impact plant communities (Stevens et al. 2010), and California oak savannas may already be exhibiting effects of such impact. Sensitive species, including lichens and other epiphytes that occupy the oak canopy, are in decline (Fenn et al. 2010). Because of the deposition hotspot around savanna trees, future increases in deposition at a regional scale may lead to more drastic changes in the plant community beneath oaks.ConclusionsThis research demonstrates how both spatial and temporal heterogeneity interact across two scales to influence patterns of N deposition to oak savanna ecosystems. The nonlinearity of local-scale deposition across the regional scale emphasizes the importance of integrating across scales in order to fully understand ecosystem processes.

"patterns of N deposition to oak savanna ecosystems. The nonlinearity of local-scale deposition across the regional scale emphasizes the importance of integrating across scales in order to fully understand ecosystem processes. In this case, local-scale heterogeneity in vegetation structure results in a deposition hotspot beneath oak trees, the magnitude of which depends on the regional context and seemingly whether dry deposition is a major contributor to deposition at the site. These nonlinearities may be critical to accurately predict the consequences of global changes such as N deposition to plant communities and ecosystems. Temporal heterogeneity in N deposition across seasons also occurred, with implications for plant community response in this seasonally water-limited system. Atmospheric N deposition is an element of global change that has received increasing attention, and this research illustrates how our understanding of N deposition and its potential consequences for the receiving plant communities could be enhanced by including elements of spatial and temporal heterogeneity at multiple scales.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank the staff at each field site for their support and assistance with this project and the Agricultural and Experimental Station of the University of California.

"AbstractBackground and AimsSpinal canal stenosis is one of the most common vertebral column diseases, which can lead to disability. Developing a registry system can help in research on the prevention and effective treatment of it. This study designs a minimum data set (MDS) as the first step in creating a registry system for spinal canal stenosis.MethodThe present research is of applied-descriptive type, performed in 2022. First, the applicable data elements about the disease were selected from a vast range of English and Farsi references, including peer reviewed articles, academic books, credible websites, and medical records of hospitalized patients. Through the extracted data, the primary MDS plan was designed as a questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire was conducted via asking the opinion of experts (neurosurgeons, physiotherapists, epidemiologists, and health information management specialists). Also, its reliability was calculated via Cronbach⍺coefficient, which was 86%. Finally, the MDS of the spinal canal stenosis national registry system (for Iran) was confirmed through a two stage Delphi technique. Data analysis was applied through descriptive statistics via SPSS21 software.ResultsThe proposed MDS is offered in two general sets of data: administrative and clinical. For the administrative data set, 40 data elements had been proposed, as five classes. Twenty-six of them were confirmed. In the clinical section, 95 data elements had been proposed in 14"
"is offered in two general sets of data: administrative and clinical. For the administrative data set, 40 data elements had been proposed, as five classes. Twenty-six of them were confirmed. In the clinical section, 95 data elements had been proposed in 14 classes; 94 of which were finally confirmed.ConclusionSince there is no spinal canal stenosis MDS available, this study can be a turning point in the standardization of the data on this disease. Moreover, these precise, coherent, and standard data elements can be contributed to improving disease management and enhancing the public healthcare quality. Also, the MDS proposed in this study can help researchers and experts, design a spinal canal stenosis registry system in other countries.1 INTRODUCTIONSpinal canal stenosis refers to abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal, which may occur in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. The main reason for stenosis is degeneration of the spinal elements including intervertebral disc and ligament flavum.1,2Based on the criteria defined by the North American Vertebral Column Society, the most salient symptom of spinal canal stenosis is gluteal or lower limb pain, which aggravates with walking, standing, or back stretching, while improving with forward bending, sitting, or sleeping.3The pain results from the constrained space available to neurovascular elements of the lumbar vertebral column.4The degeneration becomes more intense with aging. The disease is one of the most important"
"with forward bending, sitting, or sleeping.3The pain results from the constrained space available to neurovascular elements of the lumbar vertebral column.4The degeneration becomes more intense with aging. The disease is one of the most important reasons of spinal injuries and diminished mobility among the people above 50 years old. This may be related to Osteoarthritis, which initiates changes in the vertebral column at age of 50.5,6Moreover, the prevalence of this disease increases at advanced ages. It is estimated that 400,000 people in the United States, mostly within the age range 60−69 years, have been affected by spinal canal stenosis. Forty-seven percent of this age group has mild to moderate, and 19.7% of them have severe stenosis.7Women are more at risk of developing spinal canal stenosis compared to men.8In the United States, the healthcare costs associated with the back pain resulting from spinal canal stenosis have been estimated at 65 billion dollars annually. Furthermore, the indirect costs including loss of working days and production have been estimated at more than 170 billion dollars in total.9Due to ageing of the world population, the incidence of degenerative spinal canal stenosis and its associated economic burden are growing.2,10This intensifies the necessity of research to improve healthcare and management of the disease.

In 2021, the International Workshop on Diagnosis and Management of spinal canal stenosis was established with the support of the International Association of Studying Lumbar Vertebral Column to address some of the current challenges in spinal canal stenosis care provision.2In addition, some registry systems have been created in recent years in different countries for registering vertebral column disorders, such as spinal canal stenosis. The examples include (NOR spine)11,12and the Swedish spine register (Swespine).13One of the most essential stages in designing a registry system related to a special disease is determining it's minimum data set (MDS).14,15Launching a spinal canal stenosis population registry system provides the opportunity of recording data on a large scale during the routine care of patients. These data can be a valuable source for evidence-based medicine and healthcare policies.12In other words, MDS has a positive effect on the precise and comprehensive presentation of information on medical history, facilitation of healthcare plans, and healthcare provision quality enhancement as well as the duration of hospitalization and quality of life.16Precise and coherent data in MDS are used for evaluating the incidence, prevalence, and burden of the disease at both national and international levels.17MDS development is an important prerequisite to"
"the duration of hospitalization and quality of life.16Precise and coherent data in MDS are used for evaluating the incidence, prevalence, and burden of the disease at both national and international levels.17MDS development is an important prerequisite to the collection of standards, integrated, and identical data about a disease. MDS provides high-quality information for care providers by creating a national database.17MDS can be used for collection and standardization of the data. It also eases the sharing and comparing data across various healthcare centers, as well as designing electronic health records of patients.18In addition, MDS is a valuable source of information in improving patient care14and for registry and reporting systems.19,20The proper selection of data elements is a major reason for the success or failure of registry systems.20Through precise definitions of data elements, MDS should create a common language among all entities who are involved in registry and recording. In addition, it should guarantee the collection, analysis, reporting, and selection of essential data.21,22Further, MDS contributes to improving medical history files, data comparability, designing a data corpus, electronic exchange of data across various healthcare systems, and finally improving data quality.21,23According to the essence and application, the data elements of a disease can be categorized into administrative and clinical data.

The administrative data usually include demographic and socioeconomic data, address, telephone number, and patient referral data, besides the main profession of the healthcare providers.24,25On the other hand, the clinical data differs depending on the type of disease. Generally, they include diagnosis, past medical history, laboratory results, medical imaging findings, healthcare interventions, disease progression and outcomes.25In recent years, extensive studies have been done on the MDS in healthcare systems. Most of these studies, especially in Iran, have dealt with presenting a model for MDS development for a disease, injury, or group of patients.19,26-32However, two the best knowledge of authors, there is no specialized or comprehensive registry system for identifying patients with spinal canal stenosis, determining the disease outcome, and examining the effectiveness of its treatment methods. Thus, launching a registry system for spinal canal stenosis provides the possibility of determining the prevalence of the disease, the underlying factors contributing to the incidence of the disease, examining the complications resulting from the disease, exploring the effect of time of initiating the treatment, as well as various therapeutic interventions and the"
"of the disease, the underlying factors contributing to the incidence of the disease, examining the complications resulting from the disease, exploring the effect of time of initiating the treatment, as well as various therapeutic interventions and the outcomes resulting from the treatment. This study expresses our experiences in the process of developing an MDS which can be useful for subsequent registrations especially in developing countries, which have limited infrastructures on information technology.This study aims to propose a national MDS for the spinal canal stenosis registry system. However, it can be applied as a model for other regions, especially for developing countries. This data set can cover all influential factors in the health of these patients such as socioeconomic status, personal and familial history, disease-developing conditions, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and healthcare outcomes.2 METHODSThe applied study, was conducted descriptively and qualitatively in 2022 in Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah, the West of Iran in four stages.2.1 Study designIn the first stage, by studying the records of hospitalized patients diagnosed with spinal canal stenosis, their administrative and clinical data elements were extracted.

"and clinical data elements were extracted. In this regard, the list of cases was prepared from the hospital information system (HIS) based on the diagnosis code of spinal canal stenosis from ICD-10. The records were extracted from the hospital file system based on the file number. Records were extracted by the study researcher and its data elements. The sources of the study were the files of hospitalized patients diagnosed with spinal canal stenosis (ICD-10 code = M48.0). There were 200 cases with this diagnosis in the 2020−2021 time frame, all of which were studied.The second stage included identifying data elements for risk factors, aggravating factors and long-term consequences of the disease. Resources for this stage include papers, MDS in other countries, websites and clinical guidelines associated with the vertebral column diseases were investigated. Based on search strategy (Table1), the relevant resources were extracted from internet based on the inclusion criteria. A comprehensive review of recovered resources was carried out until saturation.Table  1.Search strategy for retrieving data elements of spinal canal stenosis.Sites, criteria, keywordsDescriptions, characteristicsWebsitesWorld health organizationSearch enginesGoogle ScholarDatabasesPubMed; Scopus; SID; Mag Iran (through July 30, 2012)Inclusion criteriaLiterature in the English and Farsi language; scientific papers; annual reports; guidelines.Exclusion criteriaNon-peer-reviewed papers, reports, and forms"

The data collection instrument was a checklist, which was designed based on the findings of the first and second stages of the study. The checklist aimed to match the name and values of proposed data elements against the data elements offered in the mentioned systems, as well as to confirm the coding standard used for the data in them. The data collection was done via scrutinizing the mentioned systems and review of the available documents about their content. Based on the findings of previous stages of the study, the initial draft of the MDS of the spinal canal stenosis registry system was proposed. Next, this draft was provided to five experts including two neurosurgeons, two Health Information Management, Health Information Management, and one epidemiologist. After receiving the advices, the intended corrections were made. These corrections included changing the title of some data elements, changing the grouping of data elements, adding three new data elements, and removing two of them. Finally, based on the opinion of experts, a questionnaire was designed to determine MDS in both administrative and clinical departments. The questionnaire included administrative data elements (five classes) and clinical data elements (14 classes).2.3 AnalysisThe Delphi technique was employed for validating the developed MDS model of spinal canal stenosis national registry"
