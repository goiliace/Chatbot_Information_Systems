Related WorkRegarding the research on economic management information system and data resource allocation, many scholars at home and abroad have provided a lot of references.Wan proposed an ontology-based resource reconstruction method. First, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is used to build the intelligent device ontology that describes the intelligent manufacturing resources. On this basis, the relational database is associated with the manufacturing system ontology, so that the manufacturing resources are mapped to the model instance.

"resources are mapped to the model instance. Finally, taking the intelligent manipulator device reconfiguration as an application case, the proposed ontology-based resource reconfiguration method is expounded, and its feasibility in manufacturing is verified [1].Zhang proposed a new energy consumption model that considers random workloads of VMs that support reconfiguration of computing power. Without specifying any workload distribution, Zhang proves that there is theoretically an optimal SRP that achieves the minimum energy cost, and Zhang derives a closed form of the conditions for achieving this minimum energy point. Zhang also derives a closed form for computing the optimal SRP when the workload follows a Gaussian distribution. Then, Zhang studies the joint workload distribution and computation frequency configuration problems for multiple distributed VM scenarios and proposes solutions to the Gaussian distribution and unspecified distribution problems. The performance evaluation results by Zhang on synthetic and real workload tracking data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The closeness of the simulation results to the analysis results proves that the method proposed by Zhang can achieve lower energy consumption compared with the fixed computing power allocation method [2].Yao evaluated the impact of free space optic (FSO) links on inter-rack (IRS) networks.

"consumption compared with the fixed computing power allocation method [2].Yao evaluated the impact of free space optic (FSO) links on inter-rack (IRS) networks. Evaluation results show that the FSO link reduces the average number of communication hops for user jobs, approaching the best possible value of 2 hops, thus providing benchmark performance comparable to the corresponding rack-level architecture. Furthermore, if four FSO terminals are allowed per rack, the CPU/SSD (GPU) interconnect latency is 25.99% lower than fat tree and 67.14% lower than 2D Torus. Yao also demonstrated the advantages of an FSO-equipped IRS system in terms of the average turnaround time of scheduled jobs given a set of benchmark workloads [3].Vokeman explores whether the relationship between teachers' person-organization (P-O) fit, job satisfaction, and transfer intention differs depending on how a range of human resource (HR) practices is configured in education [4].Dharan explores the evolution from basic classic \"isolated\" legacy infrastructure to on-premise modern data centers (DCs).

"institutions. The data come from different authorities.3.3. Data Resource ConfigurationThe data resource configuration in this study is implemented using software-defined network architecture. Software-defined networking (SDN) emerged from OTT (Google B4 Traffic Engineering). Figure5is a network architecture diagram of SDN. ONF defines SDN as a new network architecture that separates the control and forwarding functions of traditional networks and controls network behavior through programming. This new network architecture transforms the control function of the network from the underlying device to the outer computing device. The underlying device is abstract and transparent relative to the network application, enabling the virtualization of the network to be realized.

"algorithm4Increase network throughputCooperative optimization algorithm, hierarchical analysis method, dynamic allocation algorithm5Controller load balancingHierarchical cluster taxonomy6Reduce network overheadBackpacking algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, greedy algorithmSDN has the following characteristics.3.3.1. Separation of Control and ForwardingFrom the perspective of network architecture, SDN decouples the control plane and forwarding plane of the network, so that the control function of the network is no longer integrated into the network equipment. This closed way of fully releasing the control function from the network equipment and breaking the traditional integration of forwarding and control solves many problems existing in the traditional network and fully releases the network potential of SDN.3.3.2. Separation of Software and HardwareIn the future direction of network development, network equipment is gradually evolving toward a modular, standard, and transparent way, and the separation of software and hardware will become a future development trend. In SDN technology, the control function is separated from the network equipment and runs in the general server in software programming mode. This further simplifies the network hardware function, and the device also develops toward the general-purpose commercial hardware (commercial off-the-shelf, COTS).

"simplifies the network hardware function, and the device also develops toward the general-purpose commercial hardware (commercial off-the-shelf, COTS). In NFV technology similar to SDN, the separation of software and hardware is more thorough, and network functions are implemented in software.3.3.3. Separation of Business and NetworkSDN technology realizes the separation of business and network. The network controller only needs to define the corresponding business requirements. The specific network resource configuration methods, such as QoS, underlying device forwarding routing, and bandwidth allocation, are dynamically generated by the upper layer according to the business, and the controller realizes the data forwarding process of the underlying device.3.3.4. Open System ArchitectureThe open architecture makes the SDN network highly portable and compatible. It is mainly reflected in the following aspects: (a) the network architecture is open. The SDN architecture is a layered structure that separates the control and forwarding planes. There are corresponding standardized communication protocols between each layer, and standard interfaces are used for communication between different layers. (b) The core components are open.

"The open embodiment of SDN core components now allows external programming control, so that network entities can be dynamically deployed according to people's needs to achieve intelligent control. (c) Interfaces and protocols are open. SDN realizes the expansion of different applications in different network environments through the northbound interface, and SDN realizes the manipulation and scheduling of the underlying equipment according to different applications through the southbound interface.3.3.5. Centralized ControlThere are two commonly used control methods: distributed control and centralized control. SDN technology adopts the latter. The advantage of this centralized control is that the SDN controller has a view of the entire network and has a global understanding of the network. The network manager can globally optimize the network according to different business requirements, thereby improving network performance and optimizing network resource allocation.3.3.6. User ProgrammableThe essence of SDN technology is that network managers can influence and modify network behavior in a standard programming way. According to the different requirements of the application layer, the underlying devices are controlled programmatically. The user-programmable function relies on the standard and unified network interface opened by SDN to the outside world.3.3.7. Forwarding Plane AbstractionThe abstraction of the forwarding plane is mainly reflected in the forwarding function"
"The user-programmable function relies on the standard and unified network interface opened by SDN to the outside world.3.3.7. Forwarding Plane AbstractionThe abstraction of the forwarding plane is mainly reflected in the forwarding function of the underlying device. The underlying device only forwards data according to the instructions of the SDN and does not need to deal with other network protocols. In general, in the SDN architecture, for the application layer and the control layer, the bottom layer is equivalent to a logical switch with a forwarding function, which simplifies the complexity of the network, facilitates new service updates, and improves the flexibility of the network.Based on the concepts and characteristics of SDN introduced above, this study will elaborate on each layer of the SDN network architecture.Figure6is the detailed system framework of SDN. Next, each layer of the SDN architecture will be explained in detail, and the technology of each layer expansion will be introduced accordingly.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointSDN architecture diagram.3.4. Application LayerThis layer is at the top of the SDN architecture. Based on the open network capability of the northbound interface of the controller, the network operator brings infinite possibilities to the application of SDN by flexibly programming the network, for example, combining new Internet applications such as cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of things to enhance network value;"
"the network operator brings infinite possibilities to the application of SDN by flexibly programming the network, for example, combining new Internet applications such as cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of things to enhance network value; innovating network applications to improve network value-added service capabilities; realizing customized customization and improving user experience; according to the network operation situation, flexibly allocating network resources to optimize the utilization of network resources, improving network visualization, and realizing accurate, efficient and intuitive network operation, maintenance, and management.In the application layer, the most important is the network orchestration technology. Network orchestration refers to arranging and organizing different logical service network units in a certain order according to different business requirements and adding controllers to form physical network services that meet user business requirements.The process of network orchestration technology can be summarized as follows: business personnel define the business system and output the business template, and then, the network orchestration system maps out the logical network service view according to the template. The network view is an intermediate product, which does not involve the specific resource allocation process, but only converts the connection relationship of the components of the business system into the connection"
"view according to the template. The network view is an intermediate product, which does not involve the specific resource allocation process, but only converts the connection relationship of the components of the business system into the connection relationship of the network functional components and then abstracts the corresponding network model. For example, connection components such as L2, L3, VPN, and other flow-based network connection nodes and links are provided by switches, routers, and links; service components such as NAT, DNS, AAA, and other IP services are provided by corresponding service network elements. The above network functions will eventually be mapped to corresponding network entity devices in some form. After the network service view is formed, the orchestration system assigns tenant IDs to tenants according to different services, tenant information, and constraints to form a tenant logical network. Finally, the orchestration system sends the tenant's logical network to the controller through the northbound interface. The controller is then mapped to the corresponding physical network, and the devices at the data layer are configured and implemented.3.5. Control LayerAs the core of the control layer, the SDN controller includes the control function of the underlying device data plane, the internal collaborative management components for resource allocation and environment configuration, a virtualization component that provides network abstraction and"
"the SDN controller includes the control function of the underlying device data plane, the internal collaborative management components for resource allocation and environment configuration, a virtualization component that provides network abstraction and policy enforcement for applications at the northbound interface, and a proxy component that reflects the resources and behaviors accessible to clients or applications. In general, the SDN controller should have the following functions:(a)Network Configuration and State Management. It provides real-time monitoring and management of the network and corresponding configuration and maintenance according to network changes, such as statistical information, traffic information, and alarm information.(b)Data Storage Function. The controller stores various network data for easy statistics and calls. For example, topology information, network status information, and traffic information.(c)System Management Functions. It is responsible for the corresponding management functions of the operating system, such as resource allocation, initializing the operating environment, and system configuration.(d)System Management Functions.

"of the operating system, such as resource allocation, initializing the operating environment, and system configuration.(e)Interface Communication Function. The controller provides external applications with the ability to call abstract network resources and controller services through the northbound interface and completes the control of the underlying equipment through the southbound interface to realize the on-demand dynamic scheduling process of the network.3.6. Data LayerAs a brand new network design concept, SDN has multiple implementations, but does not impose strict requirements on the form of data layer devices. SDN can be carried on traditional network equipment, such as hybrid switches; it can also be carried on new network equipment, such as OpenFlow switches. The ideal SDN emphasizes that the network is dominated by software. In this case, cheap, common, open, and standardized commercial hardware becomes the preferred bearer facility for SDN, which helps to reduce the total cost of network equipment. SDN separates the software and hardware of the data layer network equipment. Next, the data layer is introduced from the two aspects of network element hardware and middle software.Network Element Hardware: network element hardware is now mostly concentrated in commercial hardware (COTS, commercial off-the-shelf products or commercial shelf products), which are commercial hardware products that follow open industry standards. Its biggest feature is universal,"
"element hardware is now mostly concentrated in commercial hardware (COTS, commercial off-the-shelf products or commercial shelf products), which are commercial hardware products that follow open industry standards. Its biggest feature is universal, standard, low cost, better interoperability, and shorter design cycle and production cycle.Intermediate Software: in the data layer, the software parts of network devices other than hardware and user applications are called intermediate software, including hardware drivers, network operating systems, and various open tools and management tools.4. Data Resource ConfigurationTo optimize data resource allocation, one controller needs to be selected for each zone to manage. At this time, it is defined thatVO,Pmeans that the areaQOis connected to the controllerRP. It is a binary variable, that is:(1)Recording selection strategyV= [VO,P]. Any zone has one and only one controller to control it, then:(2)To maintain the normal operating speed of the network. It is not possible to overload any controller with:(3)whereaois the traffic volume of the areaoandKPis the maximum load of the controllerp.In addition, the deployment position of controllerRPis recorded asWO,P, indicating that controllerRPis deployed on areaQO, and there is(4)Co,his the distance between the two areas.

To ensure the communication quality, the propagation delay should be less than the upper limit of the delay allowed by the system, then:(5)wherevis the data transmission rate andTmax is the maximum propagation delay requirement of the network.Uo,his used to record whether two areas are controlled by the same controller, and matrixU= [Uo,h] exists. Then, there are the following constraints:(6)Xo,hrepresents the number of times the user moves between areasQoandQh, represented by matrixX= [Xo,h]. Combining the above formula, the number of times that the SGW migrates (i.e., generates signaling overhead) during the frequent movement of the user can be calculated, which is denoted asT(U,X). Then, there is the following formula:(7)The goal of this study is to deploy the location of the controller under the condition of meeting the communication indicators required by the user and formulate the control strategy between the controller and the area to reduce the signaling overhead between the controllers. Therefore, the mathematical model of the whole problem is as follows:(8)Z1 defines that any two zones are controlled by the same or different two controllers, andZ2 assigns a controller to each zone.Z3 andZ4 limit the capacity of the controllers in the network and the maximum propagation delay of the communication, respectively.Z5,Z6, andZ7 are all binary variables, which represent the distribution strategy"

The regional correlation matrix reflecting the user's movement habits is randomly generated, and the user moves between different regions once according to the roulette selection method of the matrix.

"deployment controller strategy. From the algorithm analysis, the spectral clustering algorithm clusters the regions according to the similarity of the user's mobile behavior habits, which ensures that the regions under the same controller are highly correlated and the correlation between different controllers is low, so the deployment effect is better. So it can be concluded that, compared with the random deployment strategy, the controller deployment method based on spectral clustering reduces the number of handovers between controllers and reduces the signaling overhead of the system.During this simulation, the system randomly generated 200 regions, and it was assumed that the maximum number of controllers deployed in the system was 8. 10,000 users are distributed in each region according to a randomly generated regional correlation matrix.

When the number of controllers is small, the difference between the algorithms is very large; if the number of controllers increases, the performance difference between the three types of algorithms gradually decreases. We can conclude that RatioCut spectral clustering is the preferred algorithm to reduce the signaling overhead in the network and ensure load balancing between controllers.Keeping other parameters unchanged, different regional topologies are randomly generated, and 10 controllers are always deployed in different network topologies.

"from Figure9, when the number of regions is small, the intercluster variance of the three deployment strategies is not much different, but when the number of regions gradually increases, the performance of the deployment strategy based on the RatioCut clustering algorithm is significantly better than the other two algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that in large-scale systems, the RatioCut clustering algorithm effectively ensures the load balance of the controller and improves the system performance.Keeping other parameters unchanged, the arrival rate of user data flow takes a fixed value ofγ= 50000. Assuming that user service requirements for the protocol are randomly generated, the relationship between the total number of protocol function modules required by the proposed algorithm and the benchmark algorithm and user service requests is observed, as shown in Figure10(a).

So, it can be concluded that compared with the RAA algorithm, the GAA algorithm saves more network resources. Figure10(b) shows that the GAA algorithm works better in a system with strict time limit and can greatly improve the utilization of network resources.5. DiscussionThe impact of controller deployment on network resources based on SDN technology is studied. This study mainly combines the behavioral habits of users under random movement to generate a base station correlation matrix based on user behaviors and habits and then uses the spectral clustering algorithm to cluster the base stations to complete the deployment of the controller; at the same time, a random user mobility model is established, and it is verified that in the EPC network, the spectral clustering algorithm SGW-C has fewer migrations in the process of frequent user mobility, thereby reducing the signaling overhead between controllers.

"the allocation of protocol function modules under SDP technology, establishes the equivalent queuing theory model of the problem, and proposes an allocation algorithm through mathematical derivation, which realizes the rational allocation of network resources. Through simulation work, it is verified that the algorithm is better than the benchmark algorithm in terms of network resource consumption.The construction of the macroeconomic management information system in XX Province provides information guarantee for the provincial party committee and the provincial government to accurately grasp the economic situation of the province, to ensure information flow and sharing, business coordination, and scientific decision-making among economic functional departments, further strengthening the government's macro-control and ability to respond to emergencies and to stabilize the market. Therefore, the project construction is absolutely necessary and urgent.6. ConclusionThis study studies the deployment of control network elements in the system based on SDN technology. First of all, the functional network elements and interfaces in the system are introduced, and the SGW migration process in the user movement process is analyzed.

"on the problem of minimizing signaling overhead in the process of frequent random movement of users in the system, we propose a controller deployment strategy based on a clustering algorithm in combination with the user's mobile behavior. Finally, a series of model simulations and system-level simulations are used to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the clustering algorithm and the benchmark algorithm. Aiming at the user's customized service request in SDP, the deployment idea of virtual protocol stack under SDP platform is proposed, and the related queuing theory model is given and deduced. Finally, according to the given queuing model, the allocation strategy of the functional modules of the SDP protocol is proposed and compared with the random allocation algorithm. The final simulation results show that in the time-limited network, the allocation algorithm is used to allocate fewer protocol function modules, which saves network resources and improves the resource utilization of the entire network. According to the actual situation of XX Province, this study builds a macroeconomic management information system, which provides certain help for improving work efficiency and increasing the accuracy and pertinence of data analysis.

"of data analysis. However, there are still some deficiencies in the actual construction and use process. For example, in the information acquisition stage, effective macroeconomic information cannot be quickly identified, and it still relies on artificial data screening and collection; in addition, failing to establish an effective connection with the big data analysis system, with the help of the power of big data analysis, the operating efficiency of the system can be further improved, but we still have reasons to believe that in the near future, the macroeconomic management information system can provide more effective help in economic development and socialist social construction.Conflicts of InterestThe authors state that this article has no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.References1Wan J.,Yin B.,Li D.,Celesti A.,Tao F., andHua Q.,An ontology-based resource reconfiguration method for manufacturing cyber-physical systems,IEEE.

"AbstractWith the development of science and technology, more and more fields have begun to use AI to provide convenient services for humans. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a new technology that uses human thinking to respond accordingly through computers and robots to assist human beings. Action recognition is an important research project that needs to be broken through in many industries, such as security system, martial arts instruction, and dance training. This paper aims to study a method for action recognition using AI technology and to build a sports training management information system. In this paper, a recognition model and related algorithms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) are proposed, and an intelligent sports training management information system is constructed. The system and the model are tested, the action recognition effect of 60 athletes in a university is tested, and the comparison with the traditional recognition algorithm is carried out. The results show that the CNN recognition accuracy test results used in this paper are generally more than 90%, while the traditional recognition accuracy rate is only about 75%, and the highest is not more than 86%; the training management information system of this paper takes about 15.7 s, and the maximum time is not more than 10 s, while the traditional recognition system takes about 15.7 s, which is about twice the time of the system in this paper.

"system of this paper takes about 15.7 s, and the maximum time is not more than 10 s, while the traditional recognition system takes about 15.7 s, which is about twice the time of the system in this paper. Therefore, it shows that the CNN recognition method in this paper has a significantly better effect on the recognition of athletes' movements, and the sports training management information system constructed in this paper is less time-consuming and faster and has certain feasibility.1. IntroductionHuman action recognition is an important and challenging topic in computer vision. Recently, CNN has established impressive results for many image recognition tasks. CNN typically contains millions of parameters that are prone to overfitting when trained on small datasets. Therefore, CNN does not yield better performance than traditional action recognition methods. Additionally, sparsity has been shown to be one of the most important properties for visual recognition purposes. Adaptive sparse coding is used to capture high-level patterns from the data.Human motion recognition plays an increasingly important role in many fields such as smart home, human-computer interaction, patient monitoring system, medical, and health care and can be applied to many aspects such as public places, medical care, and security.

"can be applied to many aspects such as public places, medical care, and security. With the advent of the era of big data, the continuous increase in the amount of data such as various media interactions and chat software has generated a large amount of information about human movements, and the recognition of human movements in videos faces great challenges.With the boom of low-cost and easy-to-operate depth cameras, neural network-based human action recognition has been extensively studied recently. However, most existing methods partially consider all 3D joints of the human skeleton to be the same. In fact, these 3D joints exhibit different responses to different action categories, and certain joint configurations are more discriminative for distinguishing specific actions.The traditional CNN structure can maintain a certain degree of translation and rotation invariance for a specific position in space for the input image. This spatial invariance only acts on the local area of the input image, and the entire image cannot achieve the invariance of the overall spatial rotation in the stacked local area. Since the pooling layer in the CNN structure has many limiting factors, for example, when extracting features, a lot of useful information is lost, the input data are only a local operation, and the feature map in the middle of the CNN framework will produce large distortions and will make it difficult for CNN to achieve spatial transformations such as rotation and scaling of"
"information is lost, the input data are only a local operation, and the feature map in the middle of the CNN framework will produce large distortions and will make it difficult for CNN to achieve spatial transformations such as rotation and scaling of images. The feature map generated in the process of CNN extracting features is not an overall transformation of the input data and is more restrictive. At the same time, there are large intraclass differences between the categories of human actions, and different people may perform a class of actions with great differences in amplitude and frequency. And there may be big differences in body size between different people. Human movements cannot be completed in one frame.With the development of technology, the previous methods can no longer meet the current environment. The innovation of this paper is to propose a three-dimensional CNN recognition algorithm model, which can recognize athletes' movements more quickly and accurately. And the test results of this paper are compared with the traditional identification methods, the data are more intuitive, and the results are more obvious.2.

Yanhua et al. put forward a discriminative multiinstance multitask learning (MIMTL) framework to discover intrinsic connections between joint configurations and action classes. Yanhua conducted extensive evaluations on MIMTL using three benchmark 3D action recognition datasets. Experimental results showed that the MIMTL framework proposed by Yanhua had good performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods [4]. However, these action recognition methods are more traditional and can only be used for single human action recognition and are difficult to apply multiple recognition objects and complex environments.In order to be applicable to the complex environment and the situation of multiple recognition objects, some scholars have proposed new recognition methods.

Although these methods can be adapted to multitarget recognition and complex environments, the recognition efficiency is not high, and the recognized results are not ideal, so it is necessary to further improve.3.

AI-Based Action RecognitionArtificial intelligence (AI for short) is an intelligent technology that simulates the human brain for thinking operations and has been widely used in many fields. With the influx of AI research, AI-related applications such as smart sweeping robots, smart speakers, personal assistants, and face-scanning payments are gradually appearing in people's lives [8,9]. AI research is almost ubiquitous in people's lives, and related research is being carried out in various fields such as finance, medical care, autonomous driving, and education, as shown in Figure1. Heavy scientific and engineering calculations are originally undertaken by the human brain. Today, AI can not only complete this calculation but also do it faster and more accurately than the human"
"autonomous driving, and education, as shown in Figure1. Heavy scientific and engineering calculations are originally undertaken by the human brain. Today, AI can not only complete this calculation but also do it faster and more accurately than the human brain. Therefore, contemporary people no longer regard this kind of computing as a \"complex task that requires human intelligence to complete.\" It can be seen that the definition of complex work changes with the development of the times and the advancement of technology, and the specific goals of the science of AI also naturally develop with the changes of the times.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAI includes a variety of science and technology, as shown in Figure2. Machine learning is a core technology of AI, and neural network is the most important algorithm of machine learning. At present, for action recognition, CNN neural network has unique advantages in action recognition due to its convolution principle [10,11]. Machine learning is a multidomain interdisciplinary subject involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithm complexity theory, and other disciplines. It specializes in how computers simulate or realize human learning behaviors to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve their performance.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.2.

"to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve their performance.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.2. Neural Networks3D CNN is the most popular method used in human action recognition tasks. Figure3shows an example of a 3D CNN, where a typical 3D CNN consists of multiple layers of basic structures stacked. Each basic structure includes a 3D convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, an activation layer, and a 3D pooling layer. If it is used for human action recognition tasks, the input of the network is a video frame cube composed of video frames intercepted from the original video, and a fully connected layer and a classification layer will be added at the end of the network [12,13]. The approximate calculation process of 3D CNN is that the video frame cube is input from the input layer; the 3D convolution layer convolves the input feature cube with a 3D convolution kernel to obtain the output feature cube; the batch normalization layer roughly normalizes the pixel values of the output feature cube into a distribution with 0 mean and unit variance; the output feature cube is subjected to the nonlinear transformation of the activation function of the activation layer to obtain the activated feature cube; the three-dimensional pooling layer performs three-dimensional pooling operation on the activated feature cube to reduce the size of the feature cube; the fully connected layer further learns the features; the"
"layer to obtain the activated feature cube; the three-dimensional pooling layer performs three-dimensional pooling operation on the activated feature cube to reduce the size of the feature cube; the fully connected layer further learns the features; the classification layer obtains the probability of each category [14].Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe core part of the 3D CNN is the 3D convolution operation, which is also the most computationally intensive part of the entire network. The convolution process is shown in Figure4. The input of the 3D convolution operation is the input feature cube and the 3D convolution kernel, and the output is the output feature cube. The input feature cube in the first layer refers to the first input video frame cube. The middle layer refers to the output of the previous layer. Generally speaking, feature cubes are multichannel, which means that in addition to the height, width, and depth dimensions of the feature cube itself, there are also channel dimensions. The 3D convolution kernel is a feature extractor used to extract features in the input feature cube, which also has four dimensions. Its height, width, and depth dimensions are smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the input feature cube, but the fourth dimension is equal to the number of channels of the input feature cube. Its parameters, called kernel weights, can be trained to make it a better feature extractor [15,16]. The output feature cube is the extracted features. The"
"cube, but the fourth dimension is equal to the number of channels of the input feature cube. Its parameters, called kernel weights, can be trained to make it a better feature extractor [15,16]. The output feature cube is the extracted features. The process of extracting features is convolution, and the convolution is similar to the convolution in the field of digital signal processing, but it is not the same [17].Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe size of each dimension of the output feature cube of the 3D convolutional neural network will be reduced according to the multiple of the corresponding dimension size of the pooling cube. Usually, the three dimensions of the pooling cube are all 2, so the size of each dimension of the output feature cube after pooling is generally one-half of the input feature cube. The pooling operation is similar to the convolution operation, in which a small cubic filter slides on the input feature cube to obtain the output feature cube. However, the sliding step size during pooling is usually the side length of the pooling cube, and the small cube filter during single pooling and the part of the input feature cube framed by it are not multiplication and accumulation calculations performed. Instead, the average or maximum value is calculated according to the different pooling methods [18].Grouped convolutions can also reduce computation like depthwise separable convolutions. However, it avoids the shortcomings of the depthwise separable"
"Instead, the average or maximum value is calculated according to the different pooling methods [18].Grouped convolutions can also reduce computation like depthwise separable convolutions. However, it avoids the shortcomings of the depthwise separable convolution and does not increase the binary activation operation at the algorithm level, nor does it increase the memory access operation at the hardware implementation level. Not only that but it also has a big advantage at the hardware implementation level. Since its convolution is only performed within each group, the addition between channels is also performed only between channels within each group. Therefore, the pixel value range of its output feature map will be reduced by the number of groups, which will greatly reduce the consumption of storage resources. Despite these advantages, grouped convolution also has its disadvantage, which is the problem of poor information flow between groups as explained earlier. However, this shortcoming can be eliminated by using the channel rearrangement method at low cost, so this paper uses grouped convolution for lightweight design [19,20].This paper firstly analyzes the most widely used depthwise separable convolution method, which is characterized by decomposing conventional convolution into two steps: channel-by-channel convolution and point-by-point convolution. The advantage is that the number of multiplication calculations of convolution is reduced. Although it works well in"
"is characterized by decomposing conventional convolution into two steps: channel-by-channel convolution and point-by-point convolution. The advantage is that the number of multiplication calculations of convolution is reduced. Although it works well in real-valued CNN, it is not suitable for the algorithm model of this paper. Because the algorithm model in this paper has a binary activation operation before each convolution calculation, the depthwise separable convolution is used. It divides one layer of convolution into two and changes the binary activation operation into two, and more activation operations will bring about the loss of information. In particular, the value range of the output of the binary channel-by-channel convolution is small because there is no addition between channels. That is to say, the included feature information is relatively weak, and the subsequent insertion of a binary activation will make the feature information weaker. This part is the analysis from the perspective of the algorithm. From the perspective of hardware implementation, the depthwise separable convolution method is not suitable for this study. The purpose of hardware implementation is to use the parallel computing characteristics of hardware to make neural network computing faster, but not infinitely stacked computing units can accelerate infinitely. This is because the computing speed is also limited by the speed of the data supply; that is, it is limited by the storage"
"of hardware to make neural network computing faster, but not infinitely stacked computing units can accelerate infinitely. This is because the computing speed is also limited by the speed of the data supply; that is, it is limited by the storage bandwidth. Therefore, in order to design the operation of a hardware-accelerated neural network, both computing unit design and memory access mode must be taken into account.The research of this paper not only stays at the algorithm level but also designs its dedicated hardware accelerator for the proposed algorithm. Because it involves the design of the hardware circuit, the design of the algorithm model should not only consider the performance of the algorithm but also consider the consumption of logic resources such as gate units, flip-flops, and on-chip storage when the algorithm is implemented in hardware. The binary CNN model can well meet these requirements, and it not only greatly reduces the storage requirements but also has no multiplication calculation. It is a hardware-friendly CNN model, so the algorithm model in this paper also adopts binarization technology. The difference between the convolution operation in the binarization technique and the conventional convolution operation is that its input has only two values of -1 and 1. In this case, the multiplication calculation in the conventional convolution can be simplified to the XNOR calculation in the logical operation, and the addition calculation can be simplified to"
"operation is that its input has only two values of -1 and 1. In this case, the multiplication calculation in the conventional convolution can be simplified to the XNOR calculation in the logical operation, and the addition calculation can be simplified to the bit count calculation. The result of the binary convolution is not a single bit, but some integers with a small range of values can be represented by a small number of bits, which is why the binary activation operation is used to binarize it again later.4.

"3D CNN. In order to pave the way for the next hardware accelerator design at the algorithm level at the cost of a slight loss of recognition accuracy, a hardware accelerator with less resource consumption, lower power consumption, and faster speed can be designed. The research content of this paper at the level of 3D CNN hardware accelerator design is to design its dedicated hardware accelerator for the algorithm model of this paper. On the premise of correct function, it can achieve a high processing frame rate and high computing energy efficiency, in order to use it to build an action recognition system with practical use value.4.2.2. Training MethodUntrained CNN cannot be used directly, because the initialization parameters of CNN do not have the ability to extract features from the input, so its output has no value. The back-propagation algorithm is now used for training. Back-propagation is a method that uses the chain rule to obtain the gradient of the parameters of each layer of the network layer by layer. After the gradient is obtained, each parameter is updated based on it. The continuous cycle of forward propagation and back propagation can gradually update the parameters to obtain parameters with better feature extraction ability. The whole process is training. At present, there are some back-propagation optimization algorithms that can make the training effect better, among which the SGD algorithm is often used.

"extraction ability. The whole process is training. At present, there are some back-propagation optimization algorithms that can make the training effect better, among which the SGD algorithm is often used. The difference between it and the original BP algorithm is that the SGD algorithm only selects a small batch in the training set to calculate the gradient instead of selecting the entire training set to calculate the gradient like the original BP algorithm. The SGD algorithm with momentum is an improvement to SGD. Unlike SGD, it not only uses the gradient of the currently calculated mini-batch to update the weight but also uses the gradient of the training set that has been calculated to update the weight. Before constructing the 3DCNN structure, the grayscale features, motion features, and edge features have been extracted by the operations of the training samples, as shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4.2.3. Channel RearrangementThe channel rearrangement operation is usually used in conjunction with the grouped convolution. It reorders the output feature maps in each group after the grouped convolution operation according to certain rules, just like shuffling cards, so it is called channel rearrangement. The meaning and specific operation of channel rearrangement will be described with reference to Figure8, and various input feature data are exemplified in the figure. In order to solve the problem of poor information exchange, the output feature maps of the"
"meaning and specific operation of channel rearrangement will be described with reference to Figure8, and various input feature data are exemplified in the figure. In order to solve the problem of poor information exchange, the output feature maps of the first grouping convolution can be scrambled and reassigned to each group of inputs of the second grouping convolution operation. In this way, each group of inputs of the second grouped convolution will contain the information of each group of the previous first grouped convolution. Then, the output of each group after the second grouping convolution will contain the information of the first three groups of feature maps input, and the information will flow smoothly among the groups.Normalization: 0/1 binary convolution brings many benefits, but it introduces a new problem compared to −1/+1 binary convolution. Then, the value range of the output of the 0/1 binary convolution is greater than or equal to 0, and the pooling operation will not change the value range. Directly using this as the input for the next binary activation will result in 0 as the threshold. All outputs of the step function for binary activation are 1. Obviously, such binarization is incorrect. In order to solve this problem, the batch normalization operation in the conventional CNN can be added before the binary activation, and the input of the binary activation can be roughly normalized into distribution with 0 as the mean and 1 as the variance. In this"
"solve this problem, the batch normalization operation in the conventional CNN can be added before the binary activation, and the input of the binary activation can be roughly normalized into distribution with 0 as the mean and 1 as the variance. In this way, the output of the binary activation will have both 0 and 1. But in the binary network, the purpose of normalization is only to change the input of the binary activation into a distribution of 0 mean value to cooperate with the subsequent binary activation, so it is only necessary to introduce the mean value for calculation. Even if the variance term is introduced, since the value of the denominator formed by the variance term is always positive, dividing by a positive number will not change the positive or negative nature of the result, which means that it has no effect on the result of subsequent binary activation. Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce a variance term in the normalization of the binary network. In addition, in the batch normalization of the inference process of the conventional network, a fixed mean of the training set is used, and such a method can be directly used in the binary network without changing [21]. The problem is that the mean value of the feature map of the training set cannot represent the mean value of the corresponding position feature map during the actual inference, so the fixed mean value of the training set is used to normalize the feature map during the inference. The mean of"
"the feature map of the training set cannot represent the mean value of the corresponding position feature map during the actual inference, so the fixed mean value of the training set is used to normalize the feature map during the inference. The mean of the normalized distribution is not necessarily 0. This phenomenon exists in regular networks but has little effect because a strictly 0 mean and 1 variance distribution is not necessary for nonlinear activation.4.3. Experimental ResultsIn this paper, 60 students from a university are selected as training objects. During the training process, the students' elbows, head, legs, waist, and other parts are selected as identification feature points, as shown in Figure9.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFirstly, 600 samples are selected from the MSR Action3D dataset for training, and the training results of each part are shown in the tables.

"AbstractThis paper analyzes the user needs of the scientific research project management system, expounds the feasibility of information system development, and analyzes the business needs combined with the reality of scientific research project management. In the system level design, combined with the demand analysis of the information system function, the system module is developed in a hierarchical way. The whole system is divided into four layers: (i) core business layer; (ii) data access interface layer; (iii) neighborhood object layer; (iv) data platform. The specific functions include three various modules, i.e., scientific research project information management module, research achievement management module, and scientific research information portal module. In the system software part, the attribute encryption method is used to effectively encrypt the information of scientific and technological projects and to protect the safe sharing of scientific and technological information in colleges and universities. Finally, we look at the limitations of conducting high-quality design-science research in the context of the larger information system community. The experimental results show that the system can perform the corresponding functions effectively, and the data reading integrity is high, which can meet the requirements of the university science and technology project information management.1.

IntroductionUniversities will accelerate the formation of a new normal of scientific research supervision through establishing a long-term mechanism for scientific research inspection and further improving the management system and mechanism of scientific research funds. Moreover, educational institutes give full play to the main role of universities in their own scientific research management and supervision, improve the level of scientific research management, and promote the reform of the scientific and technological system in colleges and universities. These factors can help all educational institutes in promoting their healthy and sustainable development. How to manage all kinds of information of scientific research projects, how to evaluate the service quality of scientific research projects, and how to provide data basis for decision-making in colleges and universities are the focus of scientific research management in colleges and universities [1-3].

"the implementation of the management information system has gradually matured in the technology. Efficient scientific research management information system helps scientific research managers and teachers get rid of heavy tasks.The quality of scientific research management in colleges and universities plays an important role in the development of country economy, education systems, and better human lives. It is still one of the most important components to reflect the reform and development of colleges and universities and the establishment of informatization. With the increasing number of scientific research tasks in colleges and universities year by year, the increase of funds, and the emergence of diversified achievements, new challenges and requirements are put forward for scientific research management. It is urgent for scientific research management departments in colleges and universities to make scientific research project management more systematic, standardized, and efficient. The construction and use of scientific research management information system have practical significance that cannot be ignored to improve the scientific research management level of colleges and universities and better serve the scientific research improvement of colleges and universities [4].How to further strengthen the management of scientific research information, improve the quality of scientific research information management, enhance work efficiency, and reduce the cost of"
"research improvement of colleges and universities [4].How to further strengthen the management of scientific research information, improve the quality of scientific research information management, enhance work efficiency, and reduce the cost of scientific research management is an important topic facing the scientific research management of colleges and universities in various countries including China [5-7].

"structure of this paper is organized as follows. In Section2, we introduce the architecture of science and technology project management information system in colleges and universities. In Section3, we present the system hardware design. Similarly, Section4describes the system software verification. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section5along with few directions for further research and investigation.2. Science and Technology Project Management Information System ArchitectureAccording to the survey, the management system of colleges and universities has been basically realized. Most colleges and universities have launched educational administration management, financial management, and logistics management systems, including the scientific research information management system, which has realized the integration of various systems and has become one of the important components of digital campus construction [8-10]. Scientific research information management in colleges and universities refers to the collection, sorting, organization, storage, processing, use, and maintenance of scientific research information in colleges and universities. Before construction, in the demand analysis, according to the needs and possibilities, based on the principle of \"revitalizing the university through scientific research\" and using advanced computer information technology, we should realize the information sharing of scientific research information management, application, audit,"
"based on the principle of \"revitalizing the university through scientific research\" and using advanced computer information technology, we should realize the information sharing of scientific research information management, application, audit, office, and so on. The purpose is to integrate resources, make more rational use of and share scientific research information resources, and achieve the management effect of scientific research management, scientific research learning, and automation.The scientific research information management system of colleges and universities can be divided into scientific research office, organization, project management, fund management, scientific research achievements, academic exchange, assessment and reward, statistical report submission, system management, and other parts [11]. Each module has a subordinate multilevel management subsystem. The subsystems are related to each other and relatively independent, which can facilitate colleges and universities to select and implement important projects. A taxonomy of various modules of the university science and technology project management information system is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointModules of the project management information system.Practicability is the most important index in the development of university science and technology information management system.

"information system.Practicability is the most important index in the development of university science and technology information management system. Meeting the needs of scientific research management is the primary task in the system development and design [12-14]. In the design concept, the primary consideration is the convenience of users. A set of standards should be formulated to unify coding rules and interface style and Chinese format, as well as good maintainability, simplicity and ease of use, humanized design, functional integrity, diversity, and selection, so as to provide users with access services. The specific design and implementation of the university scientific research management system are to analyze and integrate all information in scientific research management on the basis of comprehensive use of information technology and then carry out the optimal allocation of existing resources, so as to create an automatic office system integrating information audit, query, and so on for scientific research management workers and university teachers; then, it creates good conditions for the system to ensure its maintainability and integrity in future application. The basic sharing relationship between science and technology project management information system and other systems is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between science and technology project management information system and other systems.The system chooses the most"
"technology project management information system and other systems is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationship between science and technology project management information system and other systems.The system chooses the most widely used Windows operating system as the platform for research and development and considers using Microsoft's VisualBasic.NETto ensure the compatibility of application development. The database chooses SQL Server 2000 for development. Compared with miniaturized database systems such as My SQL, SQL Server database management system is relatively more friendly. It is a powerful MIS system development tool that is easy to use, simple to develop, and flexible in interface. VisualBasic.NETprovides a visual programming environment, a convenient and fast way to develop Windows applications for everyone [15]. Compared with ordinary database systems, using VisualBasic.NETas a database development platform has the characteristics of simplicity, flexibility, scalability, etc., which are very suitable for beginners. At present, the development of common management systems is implemented in large areas by using object-oriented and database-based technology. This technology method is currently very mature and is being widely implemented in various industries.The university scientific research management information system should be a network-based management information system, which serves the personnel engaged in scientific research"
"currently very mature and is being widely implemented in various industries.The university scientific research management information system should be a network-based management information system, which serves the personnel engaged in scientific research or scientific research management of the whole university and can customize other corresponding business processes according to business needs. Various users work together through the network. Its overall design framework is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall system design architecture.3. System Hardware DesignThe system hardware design comprises three modules. Discussion around each module is provided in subsequent sections.3.1. Scientific Research Project Information Management ModuleTaking the modification of scientific research project information by administrators and superusers as an example, the following sequence diagram gives a detailed design description of this operation. The sequence diagram of scientific research project information modification is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointSequence diagram of scientific research project information modification.Combined with the sequence diagram, when the administrator needs to modify the scientific research project information, first enter the correct username and password to enter the system and select the scientific research project information modification function, enter the modification interface, and select the"

After confirming the modified information, the user clicks the \"Save\" button on the interface, and the system calls thesave()method in the business logic classBasicinformationManager.java, interacts the modified data with the entity classBasicinformation.java, and replaces the original related information in the database. The information is modified and updated, and finally, the encapsulated modification result is returned, which is processed by the system control classBasicinformationAction.java, and finally, the modification success or failure information is displayed on the foreground user interface.3.2. Scientific Research Achievement Management ModuleThe scientific research achievement management module is mainly aimed at scientific researchers and scientific research managers at all levels.

Scientific research managers review the scientific research achievements entered by scientific researchers. Only the approved achievements are included in the achievement statistics of individuals or scientific research departments.3.2.3. Query and Statistics of Scientific Research AchievementsScientific researchers and scientific research managers can query scientific research achievements. The difference is that scientific researchers can only find individual scientific research achievements, while scientific research managers of colleges and departments can view all scientific research achievements in their own department, and"
"The difference is that scientific researchers can only find individual scientific research achievements, while scientific research managers of colleges and departments can view all scientific research achievements in their own department, and scientific research managers of schools can view all scientific research achievements of the whole school. Scientific research managers can make statistics on the scientific research achievements of their departments. The statistical contents include displaying the number of scientific research achievements of their departments according to the year and achievement category and making statistics on the category of scientific research achievements according to the year.3.3. Scientific Research Information Portal ModuleScientific research information portal is a platform for the release and exchange of scientific research information in colleges and universities. This part is closely related to scientific research activities. It can timely and dynamically release scientific research news and scientific research notices, display scientific research trends, clarify work processes, and provide a login entry for business process processing. Scientific research management personnel can dynamically update and maintain the columns and contents of scientific research information portal.

The retrieved content is consistent with the data of the whole university scientific research management information system. The specific block diagram of the scientific research information portal design is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointFunctional design block diagram of the scientific research information portal.According to the demand analysis, the scientific research information portal module is divided into three parts: section display, column display, and login entry of core business. The management of the scientific research information portal is managed by school-level scientific research managers, mainly including notification news release, column management, and other portal information management.3.3.1. Section DisplayThe section display is the main display information of the scientific research portal, mainly including notices and announcements related to scientific research of the whole university, scientific research trends, policies and regulations, and academic conferences.

Column DisplayColumn display is the main line running through the whole scientific research information portal, mainly including 8 columns: home page of the website, department overview, scientific research talents, scientific research achievements, scientific research management, service guide, scientific research statistics, and download area. Columns can be adjusted as needed and are generally managed and maintained by school-level scientific research managers.3.3.3. Core Business EntranceUsers enter the corresponding business processing platform through the core business portal and conduct corresponding management and business processing on the business processing platform. The core business entrance mainly faces the scientific researchers and scientific research managers in colleges and universities.4. System Software DesignDue to the strong confidentiality of scientific research projects, the attribute encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the information of scientific and technological projects in the software design part of the system.Suppose {P1,P2, ...,Pn} represents a set composed ofnparticipants, and the access structureAis a set composed of nonempty subsets of {P1,P2, ...,Pn}, that is,.

"ofnparticipants, and the access structureAis a set composed of nonempty subsets of {P1,P2, ...,Pn}, that is,. The set elements inAare called authorized sets; otherwise, they are called unauthorized sets subject to certain conditions and limitations. IfAis monotonic, then for ∀A=BandC, ifB∈AandB⊆A, thenC∈A.Attributes are information elements used to describe users. For example, the classroom has attributes such as job number, name, gender, department, and professional title. In this article, participants refer to attributes, so access structureAcontains a collection and list of authorization attributes. Unless otherwise specified, the access structure in this paper refers to monotonic access structure.Suppose the treeTrepresents the access structure tree, where each nonleaf node represents the threshold. For any internal nodex, suppose it hasnumxchild nodes andkxis the threshold, then 0 <kx< numx. According to the definition, whenkx= 1, the node represents \"or\" door; whenkx= numx, the node represents \"and\" gate. The leaf nodelinTcorresponds to an attribute, and its threshold value iskl= 1.Let parent(x) represent the parent node of nodex, attr(x) represent the attribute corresponding to leaf nodex, and index(x) represent the number of child nodes of nodex, which satisfies 1 ≤ index(x) ≤ numx.

Then,Mvis to obtain the vector composed oflshares aboutsby using the sharing scheme, wherebelongs to entityρ(x).Assuming that the access scheme is the LSSS ofAon the access structure,Sis an authorized subset, andI= {x|ρ(x) ∈S} ⊂ {1, ...,l} is defined, then there is a constant setsuch that ∑x∈IwxMx= (1,0, ..., 0), so there is ∑x∈IwxMxv= (s,r2, ...,rn) · (1,0, ...,0)T=s.

System Data Reading CompletenessSince the system needs frequent data entry and reading and the entry is entered manually, the completeness of information extraction needs to be verified. The system data speed completeness index is a parameter to measure whether the data reading of the management system is complete. One complete reading is recorded as 1 point, and if it cannot be completed, it will not be scored. The corresponding system data reading completion index is obtained by calculating the conditional ratio between the score and the total test times, expressed in WBZS. Wherein, WBZS is greater than 60%, indicating that the system can perform basic reading; WBZS is greater than 80%, which means that the system can read data well; WBZS is greater than 90%, which means that the system can fully complete data reading; WBZS is lower than 50%, which means that the system cannot complete data reading.

Conclusions and Future WorkIt is an inevitable trend for universities to realize the informatization of scientific research project management. On the one hand, the introduction of information technology management mode can greatly reduce the workload of scientific research project managers and standardize and simplify the management process, and on the other hand, it can also use advanced database management systems to improve management efficiency and accuracy and improve management levels. The paper covers the importance of a single repository for updating and maintaining a document management system so that stakeholders can access and use the material for their respective purposes on a regular basis. The system is developed in the B/S mode, and the J2EE architecture is introduced. With the support of the information system, the scientific, standardized, and informatized practical scientific research project management can be better realized. The next research"
"is developed in the B/S mode, and the J2EE architecture is introduced. With the support of the information system, the scientific, standardized, and informatized practical scientific research project management can be better realized. The next research direction is to add intelligent automatic evaluation functions to the system to enhance the ease of use and operability of the system. In the future, we have plan to design a dynamic report generating module that will be able to generate all types of reports from the front-end without the need for any developer participation. Users have also requested graphical analysis of the data, so we aim to include that as well.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by 2021 Jiangsu University Philosophy and Social Science Research General Project \"Study on the Path to Cultivating the Artisan Spirit of Higher Vocational Talents under the Model of School-Enterprise Cooperation\" (2021SJA2124), Moderator: Liu Jinhua; 2021 Jiangsu Provincial Science Coordination Research Project \"Jiangsu Agricultural Higher Vocational College Service Research on the Development Path of Local Agriculture\" (JSKXKT2021047), Moderator: Liu Jinhua; and 2021 Science and Technology Project of Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Vocational College \"Study on the Cultivation Strategy of Craftsman Spirit in Higher Vocational School-Enterprise"

"AbstractGovernment departments are under increasing pressure to demonstrate technology effectiveness. One approach that government departments can use to be perceived as more technology effective is to understand the Management Information Systems (MIS) maturity issues that affect their departments. There are gaps in the academic literature about how African governments are dealing with the issues of MIS maturity; and this is also applicable to Nigeria. The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of some of the MIS maturity concerns of Nigerian Ministries, Department, and Agencies (MDAs). This is important because senior managers and policymakers can more effectively understand the challenges that affect their respective departments and develop context-appropriate policies. This study is quantitative in nature and primary data in the form of questionnaires were collected from 109 key stakeholders from selected Nigerian government departments. The data were analyzed using Factor analysis as a primary tool. The analysis provided a deeper understanding of some of the issues affecting the maturity within the selected Nigerian MDAs. The results of the analysis were used to develop a model that outlines some of the maturity concerns for the selected Nigerian MDAs. The issues that affect MIS maturity in Nigerian MDAs are related to: (1) integration of MIS initiatives, creating MIS vision, implementation of MIS management policies and the development of supportive"
