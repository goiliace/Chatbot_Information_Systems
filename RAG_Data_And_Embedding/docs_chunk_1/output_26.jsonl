"action workable strategies and protocols in order to satisfy the requirements posed by both patients and those employed in the healthcare industry. Because most of the people working in the healthcare industry are foreign nationals, there is a significant employee turnover rate, which contributes to an unstable workforce. Policy-makers and researchers in Saudi Arabia agree that the most effective option to revamp the country's healthcare system would be to privatize the country's public hospitals [11,12]. Figure1illustrates how the specialized healing method and the treatment and protection method, which are the main two things that are happening in hospitals, are related. The estimate shows that two key steps share information about patients and the healthcare workers themselves. This makes it hard to make sure the diagnosis, care, and assistance are all of the excellent quality, and it also makes it hard to exchange intelligence with planning [9]. These problems are made worse by the fact that doctors run their practices like private businesses in hospitals.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelationships between the two mechanisms in health facilities.4.3.

"of their administration within the limits of national laws and rules. Healthcare development for the short and longer term is influenced by state and regional developments, and medical appropriations are depending upon which options are available. For planning diagnostic and outdoor services, hospitals talk with the local government and insurance companies [13]. Healthcare management is a key \"middleman\" in better healthcare networks in the United States. Nationally, the law passed very precise budget cutbacks, restricts the frequency of some treatment recommendations, and requires individuals to pay for these kinds of treatments with their wallets in addition to keeping medical costs down.Rather than these series of strategies, healthcare facilities prefer more global and long-term measures from the administration, so they can plan their hospitals better for national and environmental protection laws. Hospitals are like specialist bureaucrats. Medical facilities can also be seen as organizations that depend heavily on technologies and knowledge. Lawrence and Dyer say that all these sorts of groups are not government departments that are set up in a hierarchy [14]. Rather, they are often based on representative democracy regulatory systems that give people who have a shareholding in the judgment procedure a formal manner to have their say.

"regulatory systems that give people who have a shareholding in the judgment procedure a formal manner to have their say. It would be fun to discover if medical facilities are run by bureaucracies or by individuals. We have come up with three types of healthcare managers to assist us with this inquiry. These allow development, functional management, and network monitoring.

"systems in place today simply cannot keep up with the ever-increasing demand. Medical services are not accessible or cheap to everyone, even though the framework and slashing technology are in place to support them. A primary objective of smart healthcare is to keep patients informed and involved in their care by providing them with timely and accurate information about their medical conditions and treatments [15]. Many critical scenarios may be handled by the user in an intelligent healthcare system. Users' quality and satisfaction are prioritized in this approach. To make the most use of the resources that are already in place, smart healthcare is necessary. It facilitates remote patient monitoring and reduces the cost of therapy for the user. The ability to provide care to patients across national borders is made possible by this technology [16]. A city's residents must have access to quality healthcare to maintain a healthy lifestyle in today's increasingly intelligent cities.Customer satisfaction is done with the offerings they get as well as the systems they use to access them. Figure2depicts how the smart healthcare industry may be divided up into many categories. Technologies of connectivity are critical in broadening the scope of healthcare's intended uses.

"the scope of healthcare's intended uses. Using wireless technology, tiny devices may be integrated into the Internet of Things to provide remote health monitoring [17]. A Bluetooth, 6LowPAN, or RFID chip may be used to link a wristband style personal monitoring gadget to the Internet for remote viewing. For example, at a healthcare facility, connectivity through Wi-Fi and underground cables are essential for sustaining high data flow [18]. On-body scanners and immobile diagnostic implants seem to be the two most common types of smart medicine diagnostic instruments in relation to medical electronics. For monitoring patients, biosensors connected to the body are sometimes referred to as \"on-body sensors.\"Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointClassification of smart healthcare.5.1. Attributes of Smart HealthcareThe components and settings that the medical infrastructure is utilizing make up a framework for smart healthcare architecture. Network platforms, computer systems, and application servers are all types of medical portals. Interconnecting multiple designs is done via the usage of network platforms. A computer's operating system might be very different depending on the technology employed [19]. When it comes to medical surveillance, there are many different program settings and therefore a wide range of smartphones and computers that may be used to implement the various components of a real-time application.

"medical surveillance, there are many different program settings and therefore a wide range of smartphones and computers that may be used to implement the various components of a real-time application. The middleware layer serves as an intermediary between technology and the end user. If you are using a more sophisticated application, you may use robots or algorithms with a behavioral and cognitive viewpoint to provide this support layer [20]. The Internet of Things (IoT) may be used to handle health data. Before modeling systems, organizations, and platforms, it is important to examine the following qualities. Figure3shows attributes of smart healthcare.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointAttributes of smart healthcare.6. MethodologyThe primary goal of this system is to give an interactive environment for its user and some improved medical facilities with big data analysis and to enhance medical healthcare quality. Figure4depicts the operation's flow diagram, which focuses primarily on the data-collecting strategy to allow for human-machine interactions. The body's important information is kept in medical data records at the health centers depending on the patient's medical history. In this method, the doctors or other responsible medical staff will continuously monitor their patients' data, inform them to visit a health center immediately if necessary, and take other specific actions, such as using telemedicine services, as necessary.

"responsible medical staff will continuously monitor their patients' data, inform them to visit a health center immediately if necessary, and take other specific actions, such as using telemedicine services, as necessary. Additionally, if the situation is urgent or very critical, the health centers can contact the hospitals to provide rapid medical services, such as ambulance service. In the suggested system, we will collect and analyze the biological data of our users in order to improve healthcare. Because of this, the most difficult component of the new healthcare system is the study and collection of the most important information from the vast biological raw data [21]. Human-computer contact is vital for the system to get more biological data, allowing it to explore more relevant information. To diagnose an illness, the new healthcare system uses an analysis of the link between a patient's biological state, mood, and evolving health status, as well as past health information, to improve interactions between doctors and patients. A novel interactive system with big data analysis in the healthcare system has been suggested in this part. The output of the system and the data storage and analysis stored in the cloud complete the system's functionality.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointHealthcare system flowchart.The data will be transmitted to the cloud for analysis and processing once it is collected and stored locally.

"the system's functionality.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointHealthcare system flowchart.The data will be transmitted to the cloud for analysis and processing once it is collected and stored locally. There, we will look for patterns in the data using MLA and DM techniques. Machine learning algorithms may forecast illness based on data from specific test cases. In the cloud, unstructured data may be available. A more advanced algorithmic foundation is required. Using the anticipated method, the expected outcome will be compared to past health data and family health data [22]. An additional report is also generated by the system. In this report, we can see how our health has changed over time. All output will be transmitted to the user's mobile device or personal PC [23]. This approach, which measures probabilistic categorization, makes it simpler to make a diagnosis. Based on the patient's medical history, predicted diseases are employed in conjunction with this technique. We will utilize this approach once again to get information about the condition of our family members [24-33].6.1. Data CollectionFor something like the purposes of calculating the HMP value, clinical service manager's questionnaires were administered. A neurosurgeon and a president of pharmaceutical and biotech leadership at each cooperating institution were requested to fill out questions created by them to acquire data about their divisions [34].

"A neurosurgeon and a president of pharmaceutical and biotech leadership at each cooperating institution were requested to fill out questions created by them to acquire data about their divisions [34]. The lengthy vision, annual improvement plan, effective assessment plan, and patient experience monitoring legislation have all been obtained throughout our investigation. The surveys were delivered and received in separate, sealed envelopes to preserve the integrity of the data. Researchers and hospital administrators alike received the same education.6.2. Measuring Healthcare Outcomes, Effectiveness, and CostEach hospital's medical affairs management office completed a questionnaire to gather information about the quality of treatment, efficiency, and finances. A hospital's mortality rate and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections serve as quality-of-care measures. To measure efficiency, we looked at how long a patient had to remain, how many beds were available, and how many patients were in each bed at any one moment [10,35]. Costs per hospitalization and yearly total revenue for a hospital were two financial indicators. The yearly data of the hospital is reflected in all measures [36].6.3. CovariatesSeveral factors might affect a clinic's ability to care for its patients, including its location, its academic capacity, its competition, or the number of workers and spaces that are on hand [7].

"affect a clinic's ability to care for its patients, including its location, its academic capacity, its competition, or the number of workers and spaces that are on hand [7]. Competitors were defined as other medical facilities in the same county that provide services at the same technical level as the hospital in question [35]. \"Staff\" may refer to any member of the hospital's workforce, including medical professionals as well as office workers and other support personnel [37].7. Result and DiscussionIn the initial survey, 85 of the 100 eligible hospitals participated; in the subsequent study, 93 of the 100 hospitals did so. In total, 96 hospitals took part in the study, and each of them completed at least one survey.

As a result, we created a scoring model using a widely available HMP variable that can identify those at the greatest risk of DGF and offer direction and recommendations for organ allocation and DCD kidney assessment.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of HMP Score. The aggregate HMP score varied from 69.8 at the greatest to 29.8 at the lowest among the 96 participating institutions.It was determined that the combined HMP score ranged from 49.3 to 69.8 and that 83.8% of the 96 participating hospitals had an HMP score of less than 65 out of 100. The average score for each of the four elements of effectiveness and talent planning, which make up the four pillars of goal setting, was 378.HMP score is evaluated using statistical tools.

"and is acknowledged as a major concern, particularly in systems governed by law. This difficulty is brought on by the vagueness and industry-specific terminology present in governmental regulations. For instance, Saudi politicians intentionally included gaps in its healthcare privacy laws so that they might be reinterpreted if business practices changed and people's capacity to follow the law changed. According to Regulation IV-3-1, for instance, \"the physician may reveal some of the patient's secrets if they are necessary for educating physicians or other members of the medical team if it is necessary to do so\"; the word \"necessary\" is purposefully ambiguous, as it is unclear precisely which secrets are considered necessary. Software engineers cannot eliminate this ambiguity, which stems from English terms that have several logical interpretations, from the legal requirements; rather, it can only be categorized and interpreted in the context of organizational processes, goods, and services (7). As a result, there is a substantial commercial requirement for tools that can automatically assess privacy texts, extract rules, and then apply those policies throughout the supply chain.8.

"study is to determine whether or not it will be possible to make use of the power of artificial intelligence in the analysis and exploration of security and privacy service in order to develop a more cost-effective healthcare system. For this data was gathered from all centers across the nation, a purposefully nonrandom distribution was adopted. Each of the provincial municipal treatment centers that was attended has its own distinctive characteristics. As a result, the study was carried out. Findings must be interpreted cautiously when applied to all Saudi hospitals. Also possible to be the result of a small sample are the insignificant connections. There will be more investigation in the future. It is essential if we are to be able to confirm our findings. Last but not least, we thoroughly investigated the business and its personnel. Concentrate the attention on the field of cardiologists; it is possible that other divisions are not doing as well as required. In our HMP assessment of a single doctor and three different management positions, we included a question on HMP to make the HMP assessment simple and practical. There were not any other types of workers mentioned, including nurses. There might be a trade-off even though future study might encompass other functions. Additionally, excessive labor increases must be acknowledged.

"though future study might encompass other functions. Additionally, excessive labor increases must be acknowledged. Despite significant heterogeneity, according to the findings of our study, senior management of the quality of care provided at hospitals located in Saudi Arabia frequently exhibited low performance. The pluses and minuses in their patient care were the same for both the highest and lowest HMP ratings. The fundamental similarity between vulnerability and best practices in leadership is that there were no indications that things were going to get better. Hospitalization rates could be projected annually based on the quality of service and the total revenue sharing capacity. In order for Saudi Arabia's modern healthcare bill to be effective, hospital administration must adopt the following strategies. The processing of disputes where the conflict's cause is implicit in a series of occurrences will demand more advanced methodologies in the future.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThe authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, for funding this research work through the Project no. \"IFPRC-166-611-2020,\" and King Abdulaziz University, DSR, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.References1Marzouk"

"AbstractWe analyzed the risk factors of mortality for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis under the Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse (DOTS) and established a predictive nomogram for the risk of mortality. The retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on the treatment outcomes of 11207 tuberculosis patients in the tuberculosis management information system in Tianjin from 2014 to 2019. Based on the multivariable unconditional logistic regression, we analyzed the risk factors of mortality in patients with pulmonary TB and established the death risk prediction nomogram. We further applied cross-validation and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to explore the efficiency of the nomogram. There were 10,697 patients in the survival group and 510 in the mortality group who had successfully initiated DOTS, and the mortality rate was 4.55%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, relapse cases, first sputum positivity, patient delay, and HIV-positive were independent risk factors for pulmonary TB death. The calibration curve shows that the average absolute error between the predicted mortality risk and the actual death risk is 0.003. The ROC curve shows that the area under the curve where the line-up model predicts the risk of death is 0.816 (95% CI: 0.799∼0.832).

"where the line-up model predicts the risk of death is 0.816 (95% CI: 0.799∼0.832). The nomogram model based on independent risk factors of mortality in TB patients shows good discrimination and accuracy, with potentially high clinical value in screening patients with a high risk of death, which could be useful for setting the interventional strategies in patients with tuberculosis who had successfully initiated DOTS.1. IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease that is a major cause of ill health. Tuberculosis is the cause of death of a single infectious disease, second only to COVID-19. The global death toll of tuberculosis will rise from 1.4 million in 2019 to 1.5 million in 2020 and then to 1.6 million in 2021 [1]. In China, there are about 900,000 new cases each year, ranking third among the 30 countries with a high burden of TB [2]. Since 1992, China has implemented the Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse (DOTS) nationwide and achieved a certain success. However, the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in the infectious disease epidemic network reporting system still ranks second in class A and B infectious diseases and the third leading cause of death from major infectious diseases [3]. Relevant studies have shown that more than half of the deaths occur in the first 2 months of TB treatment. It is urgent to explore and establish a mortality risk prediction model for TB patients during shortcourse supervised treatment [4].In this retrospective cohort"
"have shown that more than half of the deaths occur in the first 2 months of TB treatment. It is urgent to explore and establish a mortality risk prediction model for TB patients during shortcourse supervised treatment [4].In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the clinical material of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had successfully initiated DOTS, explored the risk factors associated with supervised treatment mortality, and established a nomogram model for individualized prediction of the risk of death. Furthermore, this model will improve the anticipative ability of medical staff to reduce the mortality of pulmonary tuberculosis during treatment.2. Materials and Methods2.1. PatientsFrom January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, a registration-based cohort study was conducted with resident populations admitted to the municipal TB-designated hospitals in Tianjin who were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (11,412). Pulmonary TB was diagnosed according to the TB diagnostic criteria (WS288-2008) and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis by the Chinese Society for Tuberculosis, Chinese Medical Association [5]. The diagnosis was based on etiological examination (including bacteriology and molecular biology), combined with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, chest images, relevant auxiliary examinations, and differential diagnosis.

"molecular biology), combined with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, chest images, relevant auxiliary examinations, and differential diagnosis. In this study, 11,207 patients were included (Figure1), while 205 patients were excluded. Among the excluded, 23 cases refused anti-TB treatment, 50 cases died on the day of diagnosis, 26 cases had their diagnosis changed, and 106 cases were lost to follow-up. For the 106 patients lost to follow-up, the average age was 47.52 ± 18.24 years, 72 patients (67.92%) were male, and 84 patients (79.24%) were initially treated. Furthermore, it was not statistically significant (P> 0.05) in comparison to participants who were retained in DOTS. A total of 50 patients died on the day of diagnosis, whose average age was 64.92 ± 20.22 years, 42 patients (84%) were male, and 41 patients (82%) were new cases. There was no statistically significant (P> 0.05) in comparison to the 510 patients who died during DOTS. In total, the two groups presented no significant differences.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.2.

All information mainly includes the following content: sex, age, ethnicity, case classification (new cases and relapse cases), results of first sputum smear microscopy, time from symptom appearance to consultation, time from consultation to diagnosis, pulmonary cavity, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) laboratory results, first-line antiTB drug resistance, the prognosis of treatment, and other data. Patient delay is >14 days from symptom appearance to consultation, while the diagnosis delay is >14 days from consultation to diagnosis [6].According to the requirements of the \"Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases\" and the \"Guidelines for the Implementation of China's Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program,\" network reporting of TB patients should be conducted. In China, it is compulsory that all TB cases should be directly reported to the Ministry of Health of The People's Republic of China. The medical staff of tuberculosis prevention and control should register the patients diagnosed with tuberculosis within 24 hours. Supervised chemotherapy and follow-up management were implemented by TB prevention and control personnel.

"patients included in the study were followed up by telephone or home visit during DOTS, and there were no missing data. According to the requirements of the guidelines, all patients should regularly visit designated TB hospitals for follow-up laboratory examinations, including sputum smear, sputum culture, chest imaging, blood routine, liver and kidney function, and other tests. The outcome of the study was the death of the patients during the follow-up period, including all-cause mortality. The Guidelines required that the supervised treatment periods were 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, and 10 months. The diagnosis, treatment, supervision, follow-up management, and other information on pulmonary TB should be registered in the tuberculosis information management system in China. The medical staff should strictly implement modern tuberculosis control strategies. The total duration of participant follow-up was from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020. The median time of follow-up was 6 months in this study. The follow-up deadline was December 31, 2020.2.3. Statistical AnalysisWe used SPSS 19.0 software for the statistical analysis of data.

"comparisons between the two groups were performed with an independent-samplest-test. Enumeration data were expressed as cases (%), and theχ2test was used for comparison between the two groups. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed by the forward and backward stepwise regression to determine independent risk factors using death during DOTS as the outcome of patient prognosis. The independent risk factors were imported into R software (R2.12.1), and the RMS program package was applied to establish a prediction model of the nomogram. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure (iteration number = 1000 times) was used to internally validate the nomogram model. The ROC curve of the nomogram model for predicting the risk of death was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) and Brier score were calculated to evaluate the calibration appearance of the model. The mean (standard deviation [SD], range) of AUCs from the 1000 iterations was reported. The test levelαwas set to 0.05 (two-sided) to calculate the nomograph score of each variable according to the regression coefficient of the variable (β) and variable value range (distance).3.

DiscussionTB outbreak posed a huge social burden. It is shown that a death survey among pulmonary TB patients under DOTS, with predictors, further explored, is beneficial to reducing mortality and improving the prognosis outcome. Follow-up data of 11,207 pulmonary TB patients under DOTS in Tianjin from 2014 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. 510 patients died with a mortality of 4.55%, which was higher than those in Guangzhou (2.7%), in the United States (2.7%), and in New York (2%) but lower than those in Nigeria (16.6%), Ethiopia (12.71%), and India (6%) [8-13]. Our results show that 51.76% (264/510) of the deaths occurred in the first two months of intensive antituberculosis treatment, which is consistent with the results of previous studies [4]. Multivariable analysis indicated that independent risk factors for death among patients with pulmonary TB under the DOTS strategy included advanced age, male, HIV positivity, first sputum positivity, relapse cases, and patient delay. In a meta-analysis [14], factors such as age, sex, lack of sputum conversion at two months of treatment, and HIV affected the success of TB treatment.The nomogram provided a simpler and more convenient method of visualizing the results from logistic regression analysis through some graphical notation, allowing for"
"conversion at two months of treatment, and HIV affected the success of TB treatment.The nomogram provided a simpler and more convenient method of visualizing the results from logistic regression analysis through some graphical notation, allowing for calculating the probability of events separately [15]. Compared with the traditional method, the nomogram considers more predictors and is flexible to apply. It is widely used in research as a predictive model of diseases such as cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis, and multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB) [16-18]. Since 1992, the DOTS strategy has been gradually implemented in China for the treatment and management of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and the sputum negative conversion rate and patient cure rate at the end of the intensive phase are used as the main assessment indicators of the effect of chemotherapy, without considering the effect of multiple factors on DOTS strategy and patient death. However, there have been no reports on the establishment of an individual model to predict the risk of death in patients with tuberculosis under DOTS with clinical characteristics. Based on the inrdependent prognostic factors of death of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, this study established the first forecast model of the death risk of patients with tuberculosis in China, which can realize the individual prediction and can calculate the mortality risks"
"prognostic factors of death of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, this study established the first forecast model of the death risk of patients with tuberculosis in China, which can realize the individual prediction and can calculate the mortality risks of each tuberculosis patient according to the score in the model. It will help the medical personnel of tuberculosis to directly identify the patients with high mortality risk who had successfully initiated DOTS according to different state levels of various factors.According to the results of our study, sex is an independent predictor of mortality in TB patients with a 1.915-fold higher risk of mortality in males than in females, which is consistent with previous studies [19]. Males will be weighted to the effect of 10 points in the nomogram model score on the risk of TB mortality. Therefore, males have a higher risk of mortality, which may be due to their high labor intensity and social pressure, excessive smoking, alcohol consumption, irregular lifestyle, and poor resistance, while females have stronger health awareness. However, studies have also shown that there is no significant difference in the survival rates between genders [12]. In this study, the nomogram model shows that advanced age is a risk factor for the mortality of TB patients. With each year's increase in patients' age, the score of the nomogram model increased by 1 point, and the corresponding risk of mortality increased. Other research also shows that age"
"that advanced age is a risk factor for the mortality of TB patients. With each year's increase in patients' age, the score of the nomogram model increased by 1 point, and the corresponding risk of mortality increased. Other research also shows that age is an important factor affecting the survival of TB patients; the reason may be that as age increases, the function of each viscera and the immunity of the organism will gradually decline, especially the elderly patients who have many complications, atypical symptoms, which may lead to delayed treatment or misdiagnosis [12,13,20,21]. Furthermore, elderly patients may have to discontinue treatment for reasons such as adverse drug reactions, which further increase the risk of mortality.In addition, the results of our study further suggest that tuberculosis relapse and first sputum bacteria positivity are independent risk factors of mortality in TB patients. Tuberculosis relapse will increase the weight of the effect of 3.9 points in the nomogram model scoring on the mortality risk, and first sputum bacteria positivity will increase the weight of the effect of 8 points in the nomogram model scoring on the mortality risk. Relapse cases are mostly caused by unreasonable chemotherapy. Compared with new cases, relapse cases are more complicated. Its treatment is more difficult and its risk of mortality is higher.Coinfection with TB and HIV is a group of concomitant diseases that promote the progression and deterioration of lesions"
"Compared with new cases, relapse cases are more complicated. Its treatment is more difficult and its risk of mortality is higher.Coinfection with TB and HIV is a group of concomitant diseases that promote the progression and deterioration of lesions and rapidly lead to death, and one-fourth of AIDS patients die of tuberculosis. Several studies have shown that patients with HIV/TB coinfection have a higher risk of mortality than those with TB only [12,22]. The result of our study shows that HIV positivity would increase the weight of the effect of 22.8 points in the nomograms model scoring on the risk of mortality, indicating that HIV/TB coinfection would accelerate the reduction of immune cell resistance. HIV would replicate and proliferate rapidly after entering the body, which increases the risk of TB morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that early detection of HIV/TB dual infection patients and early administration of antituberculosis therapy can improve the efficacy of antiviral therapy, thereby reducing the fatality rate [23].Our study also shows that patient delay is a risk factor for TB mortality. A delay of more than 14 days increases the weight of the effect by 3.8 points in the nomogram model scoring on the risk of mortality. Patient delay is caused by patients' insufficient attention to the suspected symptoms of TB, which directly results in the spread of lesions and exacerbation of the disease, which not only increases the burden of the disease but also"
"risk of mortality. Patient delay is caused by patients' insufficient attention to the suspected symptoms of TB, which directly results in the spread of lesions and exacerbation of the disease, which not only increases the burden of the disease but also affects the prognosis of patients. Delay in diagnosis and starting tuberculosis treatment increases the severity, risk of mortality, and transmission of the disease in the community [21]. Early detection and treatment of TB can improve the prognosis of patients and improve their quality of life.In conclusion, our study establishes an individualized nomogram model to predict the risk of mortality in TB patients during DOTS based on the six risk factors of mortality, including male, advanced age, relapse cases, first sputum bacteria positivity, patient delay, and HIV positivity. The calibration curve shows that the mean absolute error of the predicted mortality risk by the model and the actual mortality risk is 0.003, and the ROC curve shows that the area under the curve of the predicted mortality risk by the model is 0.816, indicating that the prediction model has good differentiation and accuracy, and has high clinical application value, which is of guiding significance for the screening of high-risk groups of mortality and the formulation of intervention strategies.There are also some limitations in our retrospective cohort study.

"the screening of high-risk groups of mortality and the formulation of intervention strategies.There are also some limitations in our retrospective cohort study. The model in the present study lacks an effective external validation by using data from other settings, which may restrict the application of the nomogram. Another limitation owes to a lack of information on several potential confounders, such as BMI, smoking, alcohol use, and socioeconomic status. A review investigation shows that low income, low education, and alcohol abuse were associated with therapy failure. Similarly, low income and alcohol abuse were associated with MDR-TB [24]. Due to the economic limitations of the detection method, nutritional status of patients before antituberculous treatment, economic level, social support, liver, and kidney function levels, T-SPOT.TB, gene experts, and other factors are not included in the observation indicators. The outcome variable observed is all-cause mortality, and no distinction is made between deaths from TB and coincidental deaths from other causes. Since our study is a retrospective cohort study, no data on the extent of lung involvement, the severity of the disease at the beginning of the treatment, and the time of conversion of the sputum during the follow-up were collected. In the future, multicenter prospective studies with a larger sample size shall be carried out, and a more stable prediction model established with full consideration of relevant"

ConclusionThe nomogram model based on independent risk factors of mortality in TB patients shows good discrimination and accuracy, with potentially high clinical value in screening patients with a high risk of death, which could be useful for setting the interventional strategies in patients with tuberculosis who had successfully initiated DOTS.Ethical ApprovalThis study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Tianjin Haihe Hospital (approval no. 2021HHYY-011) and waived the requirement for informed consent.

"AbstractIn this paper, the economic management data envelope is analyzed by an algorithm for clustering incomplete data, a local search method based on reference vectors is designed in the algorithm to improve the accuracy of the algorithm, and a final solution selection method based on integrated clustering is proposed to obtain the final clustering results from the last generation of the solution set. The proposed algorithm and various aspects of it are tested in comparison using benchmark datasets and other comparison algorithms. A time-series domain partitioning method based on fuzzy mean clustering and information granulation is proposed, and a time series prediction method is proposed based on the domain partitioning results. Firstly, the fuzzy mean clustering method is applied to initially divide the theoretical domain of the time series, and then, the optimization algorithm of the theoretical domain division based on information granulation is proposed. It combines the clustering algorithm and the information granulation method to divide the theoretical domain and improves the accuracy and interpretability of sample data division.

"It introduces the business data integration of the economic management information system data warehouse and the data warehouse model design, taking tax as an example. The fuzzy prediction method of time series is given for the results of the theoretical domain division after the granulation of time-series information, which transforms the precise time-series data into a time series composed of semantic values conforming to human cognitive forms. It describes the dynamic evolution process of time series by constructing the fuzzy logical relations to these semantic values to obtain their fuzzy change rules and make predictions, which improves the comprehensibility of prediction results. Finally, the prediction experiments are conducted on the weighted stock price index dataset, and the experimental results show that applying the proposed time-series information granulation method for time series prediction can improve the accuracy of the prediction results.1. IntroductionClustering is an unsupervised data mining method. The basic idea is to measure the similarity between the data based on the intrinsic properties of the data and classify the samples with greater similarity into the same class and those with less similarity into different classes [1]. In the field of finance, clustering is widely used in problems, such as personal credit collection and risk identification of listed companies.

"into different classes [1]. In the field of finance, clustering is widely used in problems, such as personal credit collection and risk identification of listed companies. However, in specific applications, traditional clustering algorithms cannot handle high-dimensional data well. The presence of a large amount of noise and redundant features makes it very unlikely that clusters exist in all dimensions. As the sample dimensionality increases, the distance difference between the samples becomes smaller, and the data becomes sparse in the high-dimensional space [2]. It is shown that in the processing of high-dimensional data, low-dimensional feature subspaces can approximate the high-dimensional data features. The subspace clustering methods follow this idea and seek to identify the different classes of clusters in different feature subspaces in the same dataset. Since the features of different classes of data may correspond to different feature subspaces, and the feature dimensions composing these feature subspaces may also be different, it is more difficult to identify the class clusters in the original feature space. The subspace clustering algorithm divides the original feature space to obtain several different feature subspaces and identifies the possible class clusters from the feature subspaces. Many subspace clustering algorithms have been proposed in the existing research for clustering high-dimensional data [3]. However, these algorithms are optimized for a single"
"subspaces and identifies the possible class clusters from the feature subspaces. Many subspace clustering algorithms have been proposed in the existing research for clustering high-dimensional data [3]. However, these algorithms are optimized for a single objective function and adopt a greedy search strategy, and thus, they have the disadvantages of being sensitive to the initial points and easily falling into local optima. Moreover, optimizing multiple objective functions simultaneously can improve the robustness of the algorithm to different data.Clustering analysis is one of the important techniques in the field of data mining and machine learning and has been widely used in several fields, including information granulation, image processing, bioinformatics, security assurance, web search, etc. The so-called clustering is to divide the sample objects in a dataset into different class clusters, where the sample objects in similar clusters are highly similar, while those in different class clusters are less similar. The role of clustering as an unsupervised learning technique in identifying the unlabeled data structures cannot be ignored [4]. For different division methods of samples, the existing clustering methods can be classified as hierarchical clustering methods, divisive clustering methods, grid-based clustering methods, density-based clustering methods, and other clustering methods.

"be classified as hierarchical clustering methods, divisive clustering methods, grid-based clustering methods, density-based clustering methods, and other clustering methods. The existing clustering algorithms can also be roughly classified into two main categories: hierarchical clustering methods and divisive clustering methods [5]. Besides, the clustering algorithms can be classified into hard clustering algorithms and soft clustering algorithms based on other classification criteria. After years of research and development, many clustering algorithms have been widely used. Although there are several clustering algorithms in the field of clustering analysis, each algorithm has its unique method for discovering the underlying data structure in a dataset. However, different algorithms processing the same dataset may produce different clustering results, and it is difficult for us to evaluate which clustering result is more consistent with the data structure of that dataset without supervised information [6]. Completely random missing means that the missing values are lost completely at random, and the tendency of the data points to be missing is independent of their hypothetical values and the values of other variables. Random missing means that the missing values are missing because of some observed data and the tendency of the data points to be missing is independent of the missing data, however, it is related to some observed data.

"missing means that the missing values are missing because of some observed data and the tendency of the data points to be missing is independent of the missing data, however, it is related to some observed data. Nonrandom missing means that the missing values are not lost randomly but for a reason. Usually, the reason is that the missing value depends on the assumed value or the value of another variable.Because of the existence of data sets containing missing data, the traditional clustering algorithms are no longer able to deal with these data directly. Therefore, exploring how to solve the clustering problem of incomplete datasets has become a pressing challenge in the study of cluster analysis. In summary, the study of clustering methods for incomplete data has very wide scientific research value and practical application value. It is an information management technology whose main purpose is to support the management decisions through smooth, rational, and comprehensive information management. A data warehouse is a new application of database technology and not a replacement for the database. Data warehouse and operational database, respectively, undertakes two different tasks of high-level decision analysis and daily operational processing and play different roles. There is a close connection between the data warehouses and real time databases, and the data warehouses require real time databases to provide large amounts of historical data to provide answers, analysis,"

There is a close connection between the data warehouses and real time databases, and the data warehouses require real time databases to provide large amounts of historical data to provide answers, analysis, and prediction results for the various topics required.The second part of this paper is the research status, the third part is the introduction of the related research algorithm structure, the fourth part is the analysis and explanation of the results, and the fifth part is the conclusion of this paper.2. Current status of ResearchWith the rapid development of the internet technology and the improved performance of data storage devices in recent years, a large amount of data is generated and stored in various industries. Among these data, a large portion is time-tagged, i.e., a series of observations recorded in a chronological order, known as time series. How to effectively analyze and process the time series data to uncover potential and valuable knowledge and information to support more efficient production, operation, management, and decision-making activities of the enterprises is one of the important tasks in today′s big data era [7]. Traditional time series analysis mainly uses statistical models to analyze and process time series, and with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, time series analysis methods based on data mining and machine learning theory have gradually become mainstream, forming a"
"mainly uses statistical models to analyze and process time series, and with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, time series analysis methods based on data mining and machine learning theory have gradually become mainstream, forming a research branch of time series data mining. In the system sense, time series refers to the response of a system at different times [8]. From the viewpoint of system operation, the definition points out that time series are arranged in a certain order. The \"certain order\" here can be either a time order or a physical quantity with various meanings, such as representing temperature, velocity, or other monotonically increasing values. The time series is an objective record of the historical behavior of the system under study, which contains the structural characteristics of the system and its operation laws [9]. In summary, the time series has the following characteristics: the data or the position of the data points in the series depends on time, that is, the values of the data depend on the change of time but not necessarily a strict function of time. The values or the position of the data points at each moment have certain randomness, and it is impossible to predict the historical values with complete accuracy. The values or the position of the data points at the preceding and following moments (not necessarily adjacent moments) have a certain correlation, and this correlation is the dynamic regularity of the system. As a whole,"
"values with complete accuracy. The values or the position of the data points at the preceding and following moments (not necessarily adjacent moments) have a certain correlation, and this correlation is the dynamic regularity of the system. As a whole, the time series tend to show some kind of trend or cyclical variation [10].In general, we cannot completely avoid the missing samples, similarly, in the association rule algorithm or decision tree algorithm, the missing data will directly affect the calculation of confidence, support of the frequent itemset, or the selection of the splitting attributes of the tree nodes. Therefore, the handling of missing values plays a crucial role in whether the clustering process can be carried out smoothly [11]. Therefore, the handling of missing values plays a crucial role in the success of the clustering process. The effective processing of incomplete data has become hot research in the field of pattern recognition. The modeling method generally analyzes the patterns of data in the dataset by finding them, establishing a suitable mathematical model, and calculating the corresponding missing attribute filler values by the established model, with the disadvantage that it is only suitable for the datasets of moderate size and with certain patterns. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, in recent years, with the rising popularity of machine learning, many missing value processing methods have been derived in combination with machine"
"for the datasets of moderate size and with certain patterns. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, in recent years, with the rising popularity of machine learning, many missing value processing methods have been derived in combination with machine learning methods [12]. How credit card issuers specifically manage these risks concerning the probability of occurrence and the types of risks is also a focus of academic research. Recognizing these risks and improving the system of risk response appears to be crucial. From the point of view of cost reduction, credit card risk management needs to find the balance between the risk revenue and the expected cost of risk to maximize revenue with risk minimization, reduce costs in the balance, improve the efficiency of bank operations, and use digital models to assess the risk revenue of the cost of risk accompanying the credit card business based on theoretical research [13]. However, Yikin looks at the three perspectives of internal operational risk, external systemic risk, and technical operational risk for analysis and proposes the basic ideas of risk control under the network model of multiple risk interactions [5].The populated incomplete dataset was processed using integrated clustering methods to obtain multiple clustering results. The consistent partitioning of each clustering result is performed using voting. Firstly, label matching is done for each class of clusters in different clustering results. Then, the"
"integrated clustering methods to obtain multiple clustering results. The consistent partitioning of each clustering result is performed using voting. Firstly, label matching is done for each class of clusters in different clustering results. Then, the intersection of the same labeled class clusters is obtained, and the samples in the intersection are divided into the core domain of the corresponding class clusters. The remaining samples decide whether they belong to the core domain or the boundary domain of the class clusters according to the relationship between the number of votes obtained by voting and the set threshold value. Determining the core-domain and boundary-domain samples of the class clusters results in a three-branch clustering result. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated by evaluating the clustering results by clustering validity metrics.3. Economic Management Data Envelopment Analysis for Incomplete Data ClusteringIn this section, we give a detailed description of the main algorithms and structures. Although we have just proposed a high-quality clustering criterion, it is still difficult for us to quantify it. The final evaluation of the quality of the clustering is often the satisfaction of the stakeholders after the clustering. If the demander is satisfied with your clustering results and obtains valuable information from it, then the clustering is effective and high-quality.3.1.

"stakeholders after the clustering. If the demander is satisfied with your clustering results and obtains valuable information from it, then the clustering is effective and high-quality.3.1. Design of Clustering Algorithms for Incomplete DataThe missing values in a dataset can be classified as completely random missing, random missing, and completely non-random missing in terms of the distribution of missingness. Completely random missing means that the missing data is random, and the missing data does not depend on any incomplete or complete variables. Random missing means that the missing data is not completely random, i.e., the missing data of that type depends on other complete variables. Completely nonrandom missing means that the missing of the data depends on the incomplete variables themselves [14]. The data objects studied in this chapter are incomplete information systems under completely random missingness, i.e., the missingness of the data is random and the missingness of the data does not depend on any incomplete or complete variables. In most cases, a high percentage of missingness is often accompanied by inefficient clustering results, and when the missingness rate of the dataset is high, the accuracy for filling the missing values of the sample objects decreases. It can also directly cause a decrease in the performance of the clustering algorithm. Therefore, we set the missing rate of the dataset between 5% and 30%, i.e., the missing attribute values of the"
"the missing values of the sample objects decreases. It can also directly cause a decrease in the performance of the clustering algorithm. Therefore, we set the missing rate of the dataset between 5% and 30%, i.e., the missing attribute values of the sample objects need to satisfy two conditions [15]. Any sample object must retain at least one full attribute value. Each attribute has at least one corresponding complete value in the incomplete dataset. In other words, a sample cannot be missing all attribute values and all samples cannot be missing the same attribute. This chapter and the next chapter preprocess the dataset to the incomplete dataset following the two basic conditions for missing the attribute values and the missing rate range value requirement for the dataset.For a sample point, in addition to the inherent characteristics of the sample itself, it will be influenced by other samples. If there are more samples of a certain category around the sample, then the denser the distribution, the more likely the sample belongs to this category. Conversely, if the number of samples of a certain category around the sample is sparse and the distribution is sparser, it is less likely the sample belongs to this category. Therefore, the effective use of sample distribution information can make the clustering results more accurate. Therefore, when calculating the distance between a sample point and the cluster center, the distance calculation can be improved by introducing the"
"the effective use of sample distribution information can make the clustering results more accurate. Therefore, when calculating the distance between a sample point and the cluster center, the distance calculation can be improved by introducing the proximity category information in the form of a ratio. The distance formula with the sample distribution information can make certain adjustments to the distance measurement process with the changes in the data set, thus obtaining a more accurate distance value [16]. In the process of filling incomplete datasets, the information of missing attributes can also be collected from their nearest neighbor samples. The denser the distribution of the nearest neighbor samples, the higher the possibility of finding valid attribute information and the closer the filled value is to the true value. Inspired by this idea, this paper proposes a fuzzy mean algorithm for the incomplete data based on the sample spatial distance. The algorithm uses the nearest neighbor rule to fill the missing attributes of the incomplete data and introduces the sample spatial distribution information into the clustering process from two aspects. One is to determine the clustering influence value of the sample based on the sample nearest neighbor density, which is added to the clustering objective function in the form of weights, and the other is to correct the class information based on the sample nearest distance between the sample and the clustering center so that"
"on the sample nearest neighbor density, which is added to the clustering objective function in the form of weights, and the other is to correct the class information based on the sample nearest distance between the sample and the clustering center so that the process of distance metric can be adjusted somewhat with different data sets, and different sample spatial information is further introduced into the clustering process as shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe framework of complete data clustering algorithm.Autonomous motivation significantly and positively predicts creative thinking. Controlled motivation has no significant predictive effect on creative thinking. Autonomous motivation plays a complete mediating role between moderate control and creative thinking, and it partly plays a mediating role between moderate autonomy/high autonomy and creative thinking. However, determining the number of nearest neighbors of a sample becomes a new problem. The number of nearest neighbors needs to be specified artificially, and if the number of the selected nearest neighbor samples is too small, there is a possibility that not enough attribute information is obtained to fill the missing values, resulting in too large a gap between the filled values and the true values. However, if too many nearest neighbor samples are selected, the filled attribute features will be confused by too many sample subclasses. It has a certain degree of impact on the accuracy of"

In this way, the attributes of the complete data and the information of the attributes that are not missing in the incomplete data are fully utilized. The nearest neighbor samples of the incomplete data are identified, and the missing part of the incomplete data is filled using the average of the information of the complete attributes of theNnearest neighbor samples. It makes the filling effect more reasonable and realistic.(2)Hikrepresents the flow rate, anddikrepresents the year. After the information granulation operation on the time series, the original time series is transformed into granular time series. The next step is to measure the similarity between the granular time series. The commonly used time series similarity measures are Euclidean distance, dynamic time-bending distance, cosine similarity distance, etc. Since the number of information grains and the size of the time window contained in the granular time series obtained from the two-time series after the information granulation operation may be different, this section proposes a new similarity measure, i.e., the linear information granulation-based time"
"of the time window contained in the granular time series obtained from the two-time series after the information granulation operation may be different, this section proposes a new similarity measure, i.e., the linear information granulation-based time series similarity measure. For many practical data classification problems, samples originating from different classes often partially overlap in the feature space [17]; see Figure1.Although the training samples in the overlapping regions have accurate category labels, these samples do not reflect the exact distribution of the categories, i.e., the information provided by the samples in these overlapping regions of the categories is inaccurate. Therefore, a reasonable modeling of the imprecise training data in these overlapping regions is needed to achieve the effective utilization of this part of the training data.Incomplete training data usually refers to the fact that the obtained training data is not sufficient to provide an effective portrayal of the true conditional probability distribution. In general, fewer training samples and higher feature dimensions are the main factors that cause the incompleteness of training data. Therefore, how to obtain better classification performance based on incomplete training data is an important topic in the design of classification methods.

"based on incomplete training data is an important topic in the design of classification methods. Unreliable training data usually means that the obtained training data has large noise in terms of categories or features. Category noise refers to the training samples being labeled as the wrong category, while feature noise refers to the deviation of some feature values of the samples from the normal range. Therefore, to obtain better classification performance based on unreliable training data, robust classification methods need to be designed to suppress the data noise.(3)Jm(U,V) represents the fixed flow,wis the weight,urepresents the proportion of different positions, andvrepresents the corresponding rate. The rules configuration management of the economic data reporting system is divided into two parts: one is the configuration management of the rules for the splitting of reporting documents, and the other is the configuration management of the rules for the verification of reporting documents. These two rules are managed and configured separately while performing normative constraints for a report. The splitting rules mainly describe the parsing rules of the business unit report, such as the interval symbol between data, the split symbol between each data item, the report description item, etc. The verification rules mainly describe some requirements for the corresponding data items of the report, such as the type, name, definition, and constraints of the data items; the"
"the split symbol between each data item, the report description item, etc. The verification rules mainly describe some requirements for the corresponding data items of the report, such as the type, name, definition, and constraints of the data items; the rule configuration is where the user input is a specific application. When the business data reported by the business unit is verified by the splitting rules and data verification rules, the system will automatically store the economic data in the corresponding original economic database for future extraction to the data warehouse as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointEconomic platform architecture.Since the processed data are in large batches, when storing the data into the database, one can imagine how inefficient the system would be if it were simply inserted with one SQL statement. Therefore, in this part, it can be considered to improve the speed of data depositing in terms of performance. It may be useful to intervene in the concept of the data persistence layer in terms of technical implementation. The design goal of the data persistence layer is to provide a high-level, unified, secure, and concurrent data persistence mechanism for the entire project.

"project. The users of the economic operation platform system are the municipal and district local taxation bureaus, national taxation bureaus, industrial and commercial bureaus, the development and reform commission, the bureau of statistics, and relevant leaders at all levels. From the viewpoint of the users of the system, the level of use and computer knowledge of the users of the economic operation platform is relatively high, and many business units, such as the state taxation bureau, local taxation bureau, and the industry and commerce bureau have established their professional business systems. Some have participated in the construction of the government portal system and the construction of the office automation system, which has promoted the improvement of the level of computer use. In terms of the frequency of use of the system, the most frequent use would be the statistical analysis part of the system, i.e., the frequency of operation of the system by NDRC and leaders at all levels would be greater.3.2. Economic Management Data Envelope DesignThe data integration rules of the original platform are cured in the program by the programmer. Although the current data integration is achieved, when the data of each department needs to be newly integrated according to the new economic rules, or when new departments are added to this system, the horizontal association requirements of the data between the departments will be greatly increased.

"needs to be newly integrated according to the new economic rules, or when new departments are added to this system, the horizontal association requirements of the data between the departments will be greatly increased. At this time, the update of the data integration module will face a lot of repetitive work, which will bring a lot of inconvenience to the operation and maintenance of the system. In the data integration, the data of each department is linked horizontally and new economic data is generated. It has certain economic data analysis functions [18,19]. However, with the continuous updating of economic rules and the addition of new departments and data, the system will gradually become huge and the data will become more complicated. In this case, the management of the database group in the original design will become difficult, and the analysis of economic data will put forward higher requirements. Hence, there is an urgent need for a technology that can effectively solve massive data storage and can effectively realize data mining and analysis. Therefore, we need to improve the platform to solve these problems [20].If a unified economic database with regional attributes is to be established instead of a single economic vertical database, a horizontal correlation of multiple vertical data will be required to create a large integrated economic database. The core purpose of horizontal data processing is to eliminate the sectoral attributes of the data itself so that"
"vertical database, a horizontal correlation of multiple vertical data will be required to create a large integrated economic database. The core purpose of horizontal data processing is to eliminate the sectoral attributes of the data itself so that the data established with horizontal correlation has regional economic attributes. At present, several cities in China have already established preliminary economic data exchange systems. For example, Qingdao has established an economic data exchange system with four departments, including industry and commerce, taxation, and quality inspection. A part of our data source comes from our own collation, and the other part is open-source data. The practical effects and operational results reflected by the initial economic data exchange systems established in several cities show that it is feasible to establish a large horizontal economic data exchange system and management system. At present, many economic theories can only be understood by professional economic experts. The conclusions of many theories have a reference role for the regional governments to manage the economy. The system needs to correlate some standard general economic theories with the regional economic state and deduce some reference opinions for the regional governments to use as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the feature subspace.In a market economy, people in a transaction will have different information, and the fact"
"some reference opinions for the regional governments to use as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the feature subspace.In a market economy, people in a transaction will have different information, and the fact that some people have information that others do not will create information asymmetry. The two results of information asymmetry are moral hazard and adverse selection. With imperfect access to information, a credit card holder may refuse to disclose all personal information to the bank so that the bank cannot get accurate information to evaluate whether the cardholder can have a credit card. Thus, in the credit card market, the mixed information leaves banks with no way to determine which cardholder has higher integrity and better cash flow. On the other hand, information asymmetry can also cause potential problems in the ex-ante credit card segment. If, after a successful credit card application, the cardholder′s repayment ability fluctuates because of a combination of factors, such as job changes, cash flow turnover, and changes in income trends, then the bank is often unable to capture that part of the information and maintains the credit limit at a similar level [19]. The bank is often unable to capture this information, and the credit limit remains at a similar level as before, while the cardholder′s repayment ability has changed. This information asymmetry also hides the potential risk of credit failure and default.From"
"bank is often unable to capture this information, and the credit limit remains at a similar level as before, while the cardholder′s repayment ability has changed. This information asymmetry also hides the potential risk of credit failure and default.From the perspective of big data, banks, and other card-holding institutions, to achieve a penetrating supervision of the cardholders, they can obtain comprehensive information of cardholders from all aspects. It not only contains financial data directly affecting the repayment ability but also includes their consumption habits, work habits, social environment, moral risks, and many other data collections, thus constituting a comprehensive information judgment system. It is conducive to reducing the risk brought by information asymmetry to banks. With deeper application in the financial field, each financial institution has built its own big data platform one after another, using the computing power of the platform to standardize and centralize the data originally scattered in various business systems using a unified data platform or data warehouse. By a scenario-based design, the making of each business scenario can be described and applied by models using their existing data for a model test and complete the application of relevant business. The application of big data in the banking industry is mainly in various aspects such as accurate marketing, refined management, low-cost management, and centralized management of banks."
"for a model test and complete the application of relevant business. The application of big data in the banking industry is mainly in various aspects such as accurate marketing, refined management, low-cost management, and centralized management of banks. Banks can make precise marketing strategies for individuals using information technology and have a valuable prediction and judgment for each customer′s preference and ability. As per the big data model, banks can record credit card information while also providing feedback on these bearers′ consumption behaviors. It is summarized and organized, especially in terms of risk control for loans, as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointOriginal and aggregated repository clusters for the economic platform.Data integration in the regional economic management system is mainly to solve the problem of data ambiguity ambiguity among economic data scattered among various economic management departments describing the same economic affairs and to horizontally associate the scattered economic data with the same business meaning to generate new economic data, i.e., to perform data aggregation [20]. The form of the dispersed economic data is shown in Figure4.

"to achieve the disambiguation and data integration of a regional dispersed economic data is to identify and locate the original dispersed economic data and define and identify the business association relationships between the dispersed data. Among the more general solutions available, it is more practical and feasible to use the principle of rule engines to solve it.Operational risk is the loss caused by the bank′s internal systems, resulting in inadequate internal processes and external events, such as deficiencies in related information systems and staff errors. Operational risk can be manifested in the form of losses caused to customers by the design or implementation of a customized product or by the lack of training of the bank′s internal staff, which makes its employees not aware of the risks they should have and the gaps or imperfections in internal processes, as well as the risks caused by errors in the authorization and approval of information systems and the technical environment.4. Analysis of Results4.1. Performance Results of Incomplete Data Clustering AlgorithmFigure5shows the experimental results of the algorithm KM-IMI and the algorithm KM-CD on the metrics DBI, AS, and ACC, where the experiments are done 100 times on each data set.

"100 times on each data set. The mean and best values of these three metrics are obtained. The underlined data in the figure indicates that the clustering effect of the KM-IMI algorithm is not as good as the clustering effect of the KM-CD algorithm. By observing the underlined data, we can directly see that the clustering results of the data sets Iris, Wine, WDBC, Pen digits, and Page Blocks on the mean of the ACC evaluation metrics on the KM-IMI algorithm are not as effective as on the algorithm KM-CD. Although the two datasets, Pen digits and Page Blocks, are less effective than the KM-IMI algorithm on the mean of the ACC metrics and on their best values, the difference is only between 0.01 and 0.02. It is easy to find that one of the reasons is that there is a positive relationship between the missing rate and the accuracy, i.e., the higher the missing rate, the lower the accuracy of the clustering results. It directly leads to the degradation of the performance of the clustering algorithm. The mean and best values of the algorithm KM-IMI on the metrics DBI and AS outperformed the algorithm KM-CD on most of the datasets, except for the underlined data. It is worth mentioning that in the dataset Banknote, CMC outperforms the mean and best values on all three indicators.

"mean and best values on all three indicators. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the improved clustering algorithm for the mean interpolation of incomplete data, i.e., KM-IMI can effectively solve the clustering problem of incomplete data as shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointExperimental results on the dataset.Observe Figure6, the mean and best values of the experimental results for the data on the UCI dataset for the indicators ACC and FMI, where the bolded data indicate the better experimental results. The experiments were performed 100 times under different data set missing rates, and the mean and best values were found from these 100 experiments, i.e., the mean and best values of ACC and FMI were obtained. From the figure, we can directly observe that the bolded experimental results are basically from the algorithm. Thus, we can conclude that the experimental results of the algorithm on the metrics ACC and FMI are better than the algorithms OCS-FCM and NPS-FCM, both in terms of the mean and best values of the metrics. Also, we observe that the data distribution of the algorithm is relatively stable with the values of ACC and FMI gradually decreasing as the missing rate of the data set increases. The data of the NPS-FCM algorithm is not so stable, which means that using the nearest neighbor approach to fill incomplete data is very much variable, and the nearest neighbor objects of the missing data samples are not stable, especially in"
"increases. The data of the NPS-FCM algorithm is not so stable, which means that using the nearest neighbor approach to fill incomplete data is very much variable, and the nearest neighbor objects of the missing data samples are not stable, especially in the Pen digits dataset. The two algorithms compared are implemented based on the FCM algorithm. Using this algorithm, it is difficult to obtain good clustering results on nonspherical datasets. The algorithms are based on integrated clustering and can effectively improve the robustness of the clustering results, stability, and quality of the clustering results; see Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointAverage ACC.The three-branch decision clustering uses the core and boundary domains to describe the relationship between the sample objects and class clusters. It is more appropriate than using an ensemble to represent a class cluster. At the same time, integrated clustering is an effective approach in dealing with clustering problems. The chapter proposes a three-branch integrated clustering algorithm for incomplete data by combining three-branch decision clustering with integrated clustering. Firstly, the attribute values corresponding to the missing data objects are filled according to the incomplete data filling method proposed in Chapter 2, i.e., based on the mean values of the attributes of all the sample objects in the clustering results of the complete data set.

Then, the optimal estimates are obtained using the perturbation analysis of the clustering center. The three-branch integrated clustering method is used, i.e., if the class labels of the data objects agree after multiple clustering, then the object is classified into the core of the corresponding class cluster domain. Otherwise, the object is classified into the boundary domain.4.2. Results of the Economic Management Data EnvelopeFirstly, the data in the data warehouse comes from various data sources, including various heterogeneous database systems, data file data, other data, etc. Using data extraction tools, by the process of data extraction, cleansing, conversion, and loading, the data is loaded into the data warehouse according to different business themes, i.e., different analysis needs, to achieve integrated storage and facilitate data sharing. Then, various analysis tools are applied, such as retrieval query tools, OLAP tools for multidimensional data, statistical analysis tools, and data mining tools, to present the analysis results in the form of intuitive charts. These analytical tools, such as data mining tools, are highly functional with the help of a human.At present, there are few information management systems for managing regional economies, and some"
"the analysis results in the form of intuitive charts. These analytical tools, such as data mining tools, are highly functional with the help of a human.At present, there are few information management systems for managing regional economies, and some local governments have established their own regional economic management systems according to their actual situation and needs. These systems are derived from the actual business needs of a competent economic department. Some of them also integrate the work needs of other economic management departments, and the main method used is the aggregation and analysis of economic data utilizing large data centralization. There is no data warehouse design for these information systems, however, the national information systems such as the construction of the four major databases adopt the data warehouse design. However, the station is higher and generally adopted by provincial units and municipalities. This system is still a blank field because it is standing in the perspective of the local government as shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointTests for each method at different characteristic noise levels.The results under the same class noise condition are similar and most of the datasets proposed in this paper obtain better classification results under any feature noise level.

"most of the datasets proposed in this paper obtain better classification results under any feature noise level. To show more clearly, the robustness of different methods to feature noise gives the relative accuracy loss of each classification method at different feature noise levels. Based on a similar statistical analysis approach, firstly, we analyze whether there is a significant difference between the methods on the whole using the Friedman test. The running time of the training and classification phases depends mainly on the number of rules generated. More rules mean more time is needed to train the rule base and more time is needed when classifying an input sample. Therefore, we can analyze the impact of these factors on the time complexity from the perspective of the number of training samples, several features, and some fuzzy divisions of the dataset on the number of rules.Figure8gives the classification errors during the change of weight coefficients from 0 to 1 for different data noise levels. The optimal values of the weight coefficients for different data noise levels are taken differently. As the noise level increases, the optimal value of the weight coefficient tends to become smaller. This is because the reliability of DBRB generated based on the training data decreases at high noise levels, and therefore, the noise-independent KBRB is needed to play a greater role in determining the final classification results; see Figure8.Figure 8Open in figure"

Big data technology can run through the whole credit business process, which can realize effective information collection and analysis before the loan, information sharing and transmission during the loan, and information monitoring and feedback after the loan. It can greatly improve the management efficiency of the loan business. After combining data analysis and questionnaire survey to analyze the problems in the bank credit business risk management from both objective and subjective aspects, it is necessary to further analyze the causes of these problems and provide a more reference piece value basis for the subsequent countermeasure formulation.5.

Since the incomplete samples themselves have uncertainty in the attribute space distribution, how to put aside subjectivity to choose a suitable similarity measure to determine the nearest neighbor samples of the incomplete samples is an important issue that deserves further research.

"AbstractBackgroundPatient engagement is seen as a fundamental strategy for achieving quality patient-centred care, especially in community-based primary healthcare. Despite growing interest in patient engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa, few patient engagement initiatives have been identified, and those often are limited to lower levels of engagement, in participation in health research or in health system improvement. With the aim of giving a voice to under-represented community groups in healthcare governance, theAccess to Health services in Kinshasa (ASSK)project supported the implementation of primary health services user committees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, designed to enable the representation of two user groups with specific unmet sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs: women and adolescents.Aims and MethodsUsing a mixed-method case study design combining quantitative secondary data (from the national health management information system--DHIS2) and qualitative data from two research World Cafe (WC1: Women user committees (WUC)n= 55; WC2: Adolescents user committee (AUC)n= 63), this paper looks at the implementation facilitators and barriers, and at the results of this initiative.ResultsWomen and adolescent members of the user committees highlighted that their participation resulted in increased knowledge of SRH and their related rights, as well as in their 'soft skills' such as communication and leadership.

"members of the user committees highlighted that their participation resulted in increased knowledge of SRH and their related rights, as well as in their 'soft skills' such as communication and leadership. In addition, participants reported greater transparency and accountability on the part of the community primary health centres (e.g. by displaying fees for procedures to counter over-billing). Ultimately, WUC and AUC were associated with improved health practices in the community such as increased use of SRH services (increase of 613% for Makala and 160% for Maluku II), including adolescent family planning (increase of 320% for Makala and 12% for Maluku II) and assisted childbirth for women15-49 years old (increase of 283% for Makala and 23% for Maluku II)).ConclusionsPatient user committees for specific marginalised or under-represented groups appear to be an effective way of improving the quality of primary health care services. Further research is needed to better understand how to maximise its potential.HighlightsUser committees for marginalised or unrepresented groups in official bodies are an effective way for them to make their voices heard and influence health services to take their specific needs into account.The implementation of adolescent and women's user committees has had a positive impact on members, organisations and communities, ultimately helping to increase the use of sexual and reproductive health services in the targeted health zones.Factors such as the"

"to geographically, socioculturally and economically disadvantaged populations.3Integrated patient-centred or people-centred care is featured prominently in efforts to improve primary healthcare services.1Patient engagement is seen as a fundamental strategy for achieving patient-centred care,4especially in community-based primary healthcare.5,6Yet, its application is still limited in the practices of developing countries, and evidence regarding its implementation modalities and impacts are scarce.7Patient engagement, often referred to interchangeably as patient involvement or participation,8can be broadly defined in the case of health care as 'engagement of patients and their family either, in the individual level, in their care and in the decision-making process about their therapeutic plan [or] in contributing to hospital outcomes and objectives as a whole',9p. 183. The benefits of involving patients and family members in their care are well documented, leading to a higher-level of satisfaction both patients, families and of healthcare providers.4Evidence also suggests that patient engagement has a significant positive impact on patient compliance and self-efficacy, on health outcomes and on the return on investment or cost-effectiveness of care.10Patient engagement can take many shapes depending on the level of implication and the intensity of the expected participation.

"cost-effectiveness of care.10Patient engagement can take many shapes depending on the level of implication and the intensity of the expected participation. It can be promoted at the individual care level, at the organisational or clinic level, and at the policy level.4Within organisations, patient engagement is said to be driven by a variety of mechanisms, with varying degrees of engagement intensity.11Low-level engagement can take the shape of participation through a suggestion box, patient satisfaction interactive terminal or satisfaction surveys, while participation in governance and advisory committees is considered high-level engagement.5,11,12Despite growing interest in patient engagement in Africa, particularly in the Sub-Saharan region, few patient engagement initiatives have been identified, and those are often limited to lower levels of engagement or associated to tokenism representation in governance committees.13,14One key underlying factor contributing to this situation is the high prevalence of medical paternalism in healthcare settings, particularly present in African healthcare settings.15Paternalistic approaches to healthcare can be understood as a 'one way relationship between a sick person and an expert physician who manages the sick person and solves their health condition',16p. 10.

"physician who manages the sick person and solves their health condition',16p. 10. In traditional societies, recourse to medical paternalism is partly explained by cultural factors, such as the lesser importance attached to individual autonomy versus group cohesion and the respect for hierarchical relationships, often due to social status factors intertwined with characteristics such as age, gender and educational background.15These cultural factors are coupled with significant differentials in the abilities of patients of developing countries, whose low medical literacy and educational background can cast doubt in providers on their ability to participate in decision-making and to make a relevant contribution.17As stated by Norman,5p.100 in relation to medical paternalism in Ghana, 'in such a dispossessed environment with stark differential vulnerabilities, physician paternalism is inevitable, informed consent appears overrated and autonomy morphs as an ethical abstraction when it comes to dealing with the seemingly mythical but real 42% of the population being illiterate'.Even when there is community representation within formal governance or user committees, evidence shows it is influenced by the modalities by which committees were constituted.18As a result, higher-level of patient engagement initiatives such as health facility governing committees tend to prioritise elitist representation and can lead to an over-representation of male participants.18This poses"
"which committees were constituted.18As a result, higher-level of patient engagement initiatives such as health facility governing committees tend to prioritise elitist representation and can lead to an over-representation of male participants.18This poses considerable challenges, as the legitimacy of patient engagement is intimately linked to the question of representation - and by extension representativeness - of the patients involved.19,20Hence the question: how can we foster patient engagement of under-represented or marginalised groups in Sub-Saharan African primary healthcare settings? Using a mixed-method case study design, this paper will try to address this gap by exploring the facilitators and barriers, as well as the results of the implementation of women and adolescents' user committees in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Condo (DRC).2 METHODS2.1 Case descriptionWith 547 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, the DRC has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in Sub-Saharan Africa.21Maternal mortality in DRC is heavily influenced by adolescent mortality, particularly because of complications from early and unwanted pregnancies. The high number of unwanted pregnancies, both among teenagers and women, is linked to the limited use and access to quality family planning services, in part due to lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights, inadequate availability of services, financial, legal and geographical barriers, and to"
"is linked to the limited use and access to quality family planning services, in part due to lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights, inadequate availability of services, financial, legal and geographical barriers, and to negative provider attitudes (reception, respect for patients' rights, etc.).22-24Regarding sexually transmitted diseases (STIs), the HIV prevalence rate remains high with almost 0.63% of women aged 15-49 living with HIV.21For both women and adolescents, the difficulty of accessing health services that meet their specific needs is cited as a major barrier to the use of SRH services.252.2 DRC's health systemThe DRC's public health system is designed as a three level 'sanitary pyramid'. The central level encompasses the Ministry of Health, the general secretariat and of health-related national programs. The intermediate level is structured into provinces, then into health districts. The health districts are in turn organised at an operational level into sanitary zones subdivided into sanitary areas, 35 of these comprised in the Kinshasa region.In an effort to increase access and quality of healthcare services, particularly at the community level, participation mechanisms such as community engagement in the health centres' board of directors, decision-making bodies and health facility management committee were introduced in the last decades.

"as community engagement in the health centres' board of directors, decision-making bodies and health facility management committee were introduced in the last decades. In sanitary areas, small groups of 10 to 15 households elect community relays that can either act as providers of basic health services (minimum package of services), intervene in health promotion or act as community health service volunteers in a specific programme (HIV, etc.). The community relays then elect representatives to the Community Animation Cells, which in turn elect the members of the Health Area Development Committees (CODESA/CODEV) which are responsible for co-managing the health centres and ensuring community participation in the sanitary area.26A similar process has been put in place at the communal level (COCODEV), where the CODESA/CODEV presidents elect representatives who will partake in decisions for the health zone. However, these mechanisms do not seem to be achieving the expected results, particularly as the participation and representativeness of certain groups such as women remain low.24This is all the more concerning given that women represent the majority of users in SRH services. These issues with representativeness often derive from CODESA/CODEV's constitution modalities and inclusion criteria, such as being a community relay (who are mostly males), having a moderate level of literacy (reading and writing) and being older than 18 years old. As a result, less than a third of the"
"from CODESA/CODEV's constitution modalities and inclusion criteria, such as being a community relay (who are mostly males), having a moderate level of literacy (reading and writing) and being older than 18 years old. As a result, less than a third of the CODESA/CODEV revitalised with the support of the ASSK project were chaired by women (29/92, 31.8%), and adolescent's voices were left out.27This lack of representation is all the more problematic given that the lack of access to health services adapted to the needs of women and adolescents has significant repercussions on their use, particularly in the case of SRH services.282.3 Access to health services in Kinshasa (ASSK) projectThe ASSK project is a six year initiative (2018-2024) funded by Canadian Government to increase access and use of quality DSR services of women, adolescent girls and children in seven sanitary zones of the region of Kinshasa, DRC (Bumbu, Kasa-Vubu, Makala, Maluku I, Maluku II, Ngiri-Ngiri and Nsele). With the aim of giving a voice to under-represented community groups in healthcare governance, the project supported the implementation of primary health services user committees. These advocacy user committees were designed to enable the representation of two user groups with specific unmet SRH needs: women and adolescents. In total, four advisory user committees were implemented in three sanitary zones (Makala (WUC), Maluku II (WUC and AUC) and Kasa-Vubu (AUC)), encompassing several health centres. At"
