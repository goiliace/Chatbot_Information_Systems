"AbstractThe management information system for compensation under multihoming network architecture has been developed in order to improve the time efficiency, accuracy, and level of informatization of compensation management in university and deal with the rising data and difficulty in exchanging information between various management information systems resulting from the changing compensation policies. This system is designed based on multihost data network architecture, including function modules of all kinds of compensation promotion, personnel historical data management, time warning, statistics, and report generation. This system integrates my five years' experience in the front-line of compensation management work. The purpose is to fully solve the practical problems of compensation management in universities, truly help the work of compensation administrators, unify the fragmented compensation management works, and comprehensively improve the level of compensation management. It has a strong popularization and signification for reference for the compensation management work of similar universities.1. IntroductionCompensation information management and statistical analysis is an important routine work of personnel department; the quality of data management directly affects the efficiency and quality of personnel management work [1].

"the quality of data management directly affects the efficiency and quality of personnel management work [1]. Compensation information has the characteristics of fast update, complex, and trivial. The practical management working process is often faced with serious data redundancy, not timely update, repetitive work, sharing difficulties, and other problems. Information cannot be scientific management, and maintenance [2] will greatly reduce the efficiency and quality of personnel management.Public institution is a kind of social service organization for the purpose of public welfare in China, which is engaged in education, science and technology, culture, health, and other activities. Most colleges and universities [3] are public institutions, and the compensation management of public institutions has a strong policy focus. In short, the compensation of public institutions is composed of national compensation, uniformly prescribed allowance, local allowance, and institution allowance. The first three parts are uniformly prescribed by national or provincial policies. All public institutions within the scope of policy are subject to uniform references. All national public institutions have the same reference of national compensation, and all public institutions in the same province have the same reference of some provincial allowance. The institution allowance is the only part determined by the institution itself. Therefore, we can find that the compensation of public"
"compensation, and all public institutions in the same province have the same reference of some provincial allowance. The institution allowance is the only part determined by the institution itself. Therefore, we can find that the compensation of public institutions has a strong continuity, especially the national compensation, which has the same reference all over the country.For university faculty, all their experiences since they went to university will affect the national compensation and local allowance. Therefore, the compensation management in university is complex. It is necessary to have all the study and work records of each staff to determine their compensation. With the growing number of talents in universities and the rapid development of internet and information technology, compensation management has entered the digital era, and the informatization construction of universities has been further promoted. As the essential tool of compensation management, a management information system (MIS) for compensation plays a positive role in the management of universities. At the same time, the compensation management in university is characterized by strong policy, large amount of data, and detailed report forms and request highly accurate and safe. Thus, a flexible and efficient MIS for compensation which can make the compensation management work tends to be more scientific, standardized, and modern urgently needs to be developed.The traditional host network or end"
"request highly accurate and safe. Thus, a flexible and efficient MIS for compensation which can make the compensation management work tends to be more scientific, standardized, and modern urgently needs to be developed.The traditional host network or end users usually only connect to the content source network through a single path. When the only exit path fails, the whole client network cannot get the content source. This problem can be solved by using multihoming technology [4]. The client network can be connected to the outside world through multiple outlets, such as WiFi network [5] and 4G network [6]. When one network fails, it can also transmit data through other networks. In the real network transmission, especially in the big data network [7], the multihoming technology can not only ensure the transmission stability but also improve the transmission efficiency. The client network can simultaneously transmit data through multiple network paths to increase the transmission speed or select the shortest exit of the transmission destination path to reduce the transmission time.The multihoming technology under TCP/IP architecture [8] has been relatively mature. The classic solutions include host multihoming technology, transport layer multihoming technology, and network layer multihoming technology. Host multihoming technology mainly uses the large address space in IPv6 [9] to communicate with different ISPs depending on multiple IP addresses owned by each host, so as to"
"layer multihoming technology, and network layer multihoming technology. Host multihoming technology mainly uses the large address space in IPv6 [9] to communicate with different ISPs depending on multiple IP addresses owned by each host, so as to obtain content from multiple paths. For example, in multiple care of address registration (MCoA [10]), the mobile host or user can register multiple care of addresses for the home address, create multiple binding cache entries, number them with a new binding ID, and send this message in the binding update. Transport layer multihoming technology mainly refers to the design of a new transport protocol supporting multihoming technology to replace TCP technology. For example, Dreibholz et al. designed a new transport layer protocol: flow control transport protocol (SCTP [11]). SCTP is a unicast protocol that supports data exchange between two endpoints and allows each endpoint to have multiple IP addresses. Network layer multihoming technology mainly refers to the technology of inserting a new protocol stack between network layer and transport layer. The representative of network layer multihoming technology is host identity protocol (HIP [12]) and Shim6 [13]. These technologies complete the mapping from a single host name to multiple network addresses by introducing a new namespace, and transition between network layer and transport layer, so as to achieve multihoming transmission.Based on the practical work of compensation management"
"the mapping from a single host name to multiple network addresses by introducing a new namespace, and transition between network layer and transport layer, so as to achieve multihoming transmission.Based on the practical work of compensation management in our university, this paper takes the digital campus construction [14] as an opportunity to develop a management information system for compensation under multihoming network architecture (MNC-MIS). Based on the in-depth study of the characteristics of compensation management in university and the composition of personnel information, through the analysis and research on the types, structures, and characteristics of our university faculty information, MIS for compensation management is designed, which adapt to the characteristics of university and provided an information platform for university compensation management, analysis, and decision-making. The main contributions are as follows:(1)The multihoming network architecture of MIS for compensation is designed: this MIS is based on the construction of digital campus. This paper presents the multihoming network architecture of MIS for compensation.

In the external layer, the MIS systems that need compensation data support can interact with each other through the unified data bus format. The interaction layer mainly includes the program modules that need to interact with users, which is the entrance and exit of the system. The application layer processes all data management, and the data layer stores system data(3)The function module design of MNC-MIS is given: including all kinds of function modules of compensation promotion, all kinds of function modules of time warning, function module of personnel history data management, and all kinds of function modules of statistics and report generation.

"as examples, this paper explains the flow and operation of the system dataIn the remainder of this paper, problems of the existing compensation data management system are discussed in Section2. The design of the management information system for compensation under multihoming network architecture is given in Section3. Section4presents the function and effect of MNC-MIS. Finally, the conclusions and future research are provided in Section5.2. Problems of the Existing Compensation Data Management SystemAt present, there are not many colleges and universities that have developed MIS for compensation. There are six major problems of existing compensation management systems.(1)Data storage and management methods are very backwardThe compensation data management of many colleges and universities is mainly composed of paper files and electronic files. These electronic files are also basically electronic documents formed by office software such as word or excel. They are operated on a single machine and can achieve information sharing through U-disk or e-mail, which causes problems such as inaccurate data, repeated processing of information, and difficult to achieve real-time sharing. The existing compensation data management systems in colleges and universities are different, and there is no effective management mode. The commercial development of MIS for compensation is mainly for enterprises and [15], which is expensive, and has full functions but lacks personalized demand, which"
"in colleges and universities are different, and there is no effective management mode. The commercial development of MIS for compensation is mainly for enterprises and [15], which is expensive, and has full functions but lacks personalized demand, which is difficult to meet the needs of compensation data management in universities.(2)Salary data cannot be exchangedThe existing compensation management system is self-closed. In the existing system, the common problem is that all kinds of systems are independent of each other and lack of information automatic conversion and sharing function. Operators need to switch back and forth between various systems frequently, which is the inevitable result of the single machine era. Although a large amount of data has been accumulated and collected formally, the repeated storage of these original data has not been scientifically sorted and classified, which brings not only information but also information garbage. Therefore, it is difficult to extract valuable composite information from it.(3)The workload of information maintenance is largeThe information age is full of competition. System developers usually adopt short, flat, and fast system design schemes, lacking overall consideration and optimal combination, resulting in repeated investment of many resources and waste of financial resources, increase the amount of redundant information, occupy storage space, and increase the amount of maintenance. On the other hand, the amount of"
"and optimal combination, resulting in repeated investment of many resources and waste of financial resources, increase the amount of redundant information, occupy storage space, and increase the amount of maintenance. On the other hand, the amount of maintenance comes from the C/S structure of the system itself [16], which is characterized by maintaining both the server and the client.(4)Lack of big data analysis and auxiliary salary decision-making functionsManagement and decision-making are inseparable, but people often ignore the important link of decision-making when developing the system. Compensation management software only provides the daily business, ignoring such important information as the comparison between the growth rate of annual total income and the average compensation level of the society in the same period, the analysis of the salary distribution ratio of all kinds of personnel, the relationship between labour costs and benefits, etc. These data are usually the key to assist decision-making, but they cannot be obtained directly. This is a serious system functional defect.(5)Lack of automatic reminder functionCurrent systems usually do not prompt managers what work they should pay attention to, such as a teacher who is close to retirement age and needs to calculate the retirement compensation. Or when the time for unified compensation adjustment is up, you need to modify compensation data in batch. The resulting mistakes often affect the working mood of"
"a teacher who is close to retirement age and needs to calculate the retirement compensation. Or when the time for unified compensation adjustment is up, you need to modify compensation data in batch. The resulting mistakes often affect the working mood of both sides.(6)The visualization of management information is poorAt present, the informatization reform of university is still in the exploratory stage, and the degree of management information visualization is low. In the process of information management in universities, problems such as lack of data, noise, and unstructured are often faced, which hinder the information decision-making.Nowadays, there are many kinds of MIS for compensation management in the market, but most of them are not practical enough, especially the MIS for compensation management in universities. There are many defects such as incomplete function, poor report processing function, complicated query, and statistics. At the same time, the current compensation management system used by our school was developed in the 1990s, which requires low versions of computer hardware and software. Its development background is based on the postcompensation system of the 1993 compensation policy. Obviously, the system cannot adapt to the rapid development of computer science and technology and also cannot meet the requirements of a merit pay system. Therefore, a new MIS for compensation has to be developed.3. Design of Management Information System for Compensation"
"cannot adapt to the rapid development of computer science and technology and also cannot meet the requirements of a merit pay system. Therefore, a new MIS for compensation has to be developed.3. Design of Management Information System for Compensation under Multihoming Network Architecture3.1. Multihoming Network ArchitectureThere is a large amount of compensation management data in universities, and the real-time requirement of data processing is high. In this paper, combined with the actual compensation management work of our school, taking the digital campus construction as an opportunity, we develop the MNC-MIS. The schematic diagram of the multihoming data network structure is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointMultihoming network architecture of MNC-MIS.The network architecture is divided into three layers: data source, multihoming network, and terminal processor. Among them, the data source stores compensation management data, the multihoming network includes 4G or 5G network [17], LAN [18], IPv4, and IPv6 [19], and the terminal processor can be PC, smartphone, or tablet computer [20]. The advantage of multihoming network architecture is that when one of the network links is disconnected, the end users can still get the data source through other host networks, which will not affect the development of compensation management.3.2. Overall Structure Design of MNC-MISThe overall structure of the system is divided into four layers, the interaction"
"end users can still get the data source through other host networks, which will not affect the development of compensation management.3.2. Overall Structure Design of MNC-MISThe overall structure of the system is divided into four layers, the interaction layer, application layer, data layer, and the external layer of other external systems, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall structure of MNC-MIS.3.2.1. External LayerDue to the existence of the unified data platform of Donghua University, each MIS can exchange data through the unified data bus format. MIS for personal affairs, finance, and the retired are the systems with the most frequent data interaction with MNC-MIS. These MIS and other MIS of the university which may require compensation data support constitute the external layer.MIS for personal affairs is mentioned in this layer. Can MNC-MIS directly use personnel information in MIS for personal affairs without having its own personal records database? The answer is no, because although the information in the two MIS is generally called personnel information, the content of the two is actually different. MIS for personal affairs focuses on all kinds of information related to personnel employment and management, while MNC-MIS focuses on all kinds of information related to compensation. Of course, such public information as name, ID, professional title, and position must be reused by both MIS.3.2.2. Interaction LayerThe interaction layer"
"employment and management, while MNC-MIS focuses on all kinds of information related to compensation. Of course, such public information as name, ID, professional title, and position must be reused by both MIS.3.2.2. Interaction LayerThe interaction layer mainly includes the program modules that need to interact with users, and it is the entrance and exit of the system.3.2.3. Application LayerThe application layer is the main part of the MIS and the core business logic of the whole system. All the internal processes of data management and processing occur in this layer. At the same time, this layer is the only one that has relations with all the other three layers.3.2.4. Data Storage LayerAs the name suggests, the data storage layer is where the data is. The core data of this system is divided into two parts: one is the file personal records data and the compensation standard information associated with it. Which data is divided into two parts again, the data of working staff and the retired are stored in the two core databases of the data storage layer. The other core data is the actual payroll data, which also has a special core database. In addition, there are many kinds of subdatabases in this layer, such as historical information database, compensation reference database, and format of report form database. These sublibraries play the role of expanding the core library or supporting the storage of some business logic in the application layer.3.3. System Function Module"
"information database, compensation reference database, and format of report form database. These sublibraries play the role of expanding the core library or supporting the storage of some business logic in the application layer.3.3. System Function Module DesignOn the basis of the overall structure design of the system, we give the system module design, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem function module design of MNC-MIS.The function and significance of some important modules are as follows:(1)Various compensation promotion modulesAs mentioned in the first chapter, the compensation of public institutions has a strong policy focus, according to these policies, such as pay grade salary, Shanghai post allowance and other compensation items will be promoted naturally with the increase of teachers' working years. Of course, promotion cannot simply increase a fixed amount every year but has a series of constraint conditions. For example, promotion of pay grade salary needs to meet the constraints of passing the assessment, being on the job all year round, and not skipping a grade in the previous year, while the promotion of post allowance in Shanghai needs to meet the conditions of seniority being divided exactly by 5, being on the job all year round, and seniority ≤ 35.All kinds of compensation promotion program modules in this MIS are written to solve the above problems. These modules have embedded judgment programs, which computerize the policy"
"divided exactly by 5, being on the job all year round, and seniority ≤ 35.All kinds of compensation promotion program modules in this MIS are written to solve the above problems. These modules have embedded judgment programs, which computerize the policy language, so that the computer can calculate the compensation after promotion according to the personal record database and compensation reference database. The working process of these program modules can also be seen in the data flow diagram in the following.(2)Various time warning modulesIn the work of compensation management in universities, due to the large number of teachers in universities, and the existence of dozens of policy which affects the change of compensation of faculty. For example, a new master's or doctor's degree student who has just joined the work will be transferred from an unassigned faculty member to a faculty of certain position level through position orientation after three months. Another example is that a teacher who has reached the age of 60 needs to retire, and his or her on-the-job pay will stop accordingly. There are still many such changes. Therefore, relying on human brain memory or form reminders is not timely or even omitted. The advantages of various time early warning modules in this MIS are reflected here. Through these modules, the system can accurately and timely give the administrator feedback reminder, so that the administrator can have enough time to deal with the relevant"
"advantages of various time early warning modules in this MIS are reflected here. Through these modules, the system can accurately and timely give the administrator feedback reminder, so that the administrator can have enough time to deal with the relevant changes, improve work efficiency, and also enhance the timeliness and accuracy of the work.(3)Personnel history data managementThe compensation policy of public institutions is not only numerous but also requires very meticulous. The whole experience of learning, work, and promotion of faculty is the basis and requirement of compensation promotion of public institutions. For example, in 2006, the starting grade of pay grade salary should be calculated according to the information of each teacher's number of years of schooling, number of years of working, and number of years of being in current position. Therefore, a good MIS for compensation must have the function of historical data record management.The personnel history data management module shall be able to automatically record each employee's promotion time of title or position, and the compensation adjustment situation every time, and store them in a special database for long-term storage to provide various compensation adjustment policies. With the centralized management of the system, the compensation management has gone away from the original fragmented records, as well as a large number of complicated manual data checking process, and entered an efficient and"
"adjustment policies. With the centralized management of the system, the compensation management has gone away from the original fragmented records, as well as a large number of complicated manual data checking process, and entered an efficient and automatic era.(4)All kinds of statistics module and report generation moduleCompensation in universities should be under the jurisdiction of higher authorities. Take Donghua University as an example, it is under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipal Government where it is located, and under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education of PRC. The above departments require our university to submit various compensation reports every quarter and every year. However, due to different management departments, these reports not only have different formats but also have different statistical calibers. In the absence of system support, we can only use a lot of time to split and summarize the original data of Excel in different forms according to different requirements, so as to meet the requirements of various reports.Module for statistics of all kinds of indicators with module for report form generation of this MIS gives a perfect solution to this problem. These modules can use the data in both reference compensation database and actual payroll database and give different forms of reports according to the presupposed forms of report. At the same time, the system also has a format editor, which makes it convenient, accurate, and fast to"
"in both reference compensation database and actual payroll database and give different forms of reports according to the presupposed forms of report. At the same time, the system also has a format editor, which makes it convenient, accurate, and fast to report as you wish.3.4. Design of System Data FlowData flow is the \"blood\" of each module of the system, so the design quality of data flow also reflects the quality of MNC-MIS and further reflects the level of compensation management in this university. The data flow diagram of MNC-MIS is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointData flow diagram of MNC-MIS.The first thing to explain is that the program modules corresponding to entities 18 and 19 in the figure are connected with all the databases in the figure, but if they are lined with all the databases, the overall image will be very chaotic. Therefore, for the convenience of drawing, the \"all database in this MIS\" database flag represented by dotted line is drawn to refer to all databases in the diagram.In this figure, we can see not only the operation condition of the data in this MIS but also the process of compensation management in Chinese universities. So, let us take the practical work of several processes in universities to help you understand and read the operation of the system data.3.4.1. New Teachers Are Coming InWhen a new teacher starts his or her career, he or she will first go through the check-in procedures in the personnel section of the"
"in universities to help you understand and read the operation of the system data.3.4.1. New Teachers Are Coming InWhen a new teacher starts his or her career, he or she will first go through the check-in procedures in the personnel section of the human resource department and fill in his or her personal certificate information, study and work experience, and other information in the MIS for personal affairs. The MIS for personal affairs will push the above information related to determining the compensation standard, and through the selection and processing module shown in entity 2, the selected information will be imported into the personal record database of the MIS. So, how to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the information? This has to mention the personnel archive system with Chinese characteristics.Personnel archives are paper materials recording personal identity, education background, qualifications, and other important contents. In China, each unit has a special file management organization. One cannot read its own personnel archive for life, and there are a series of systems to ensure the safety and confidentiality of archives in the process of storage and circulation. Therefore, if we want to determine the accuracy of personal information, we only need to view and refer to the personal file. The compensation administrator has the right to view personal archives.In Figure4, you can also see the process of compensation administrator consulting personal"
"the accuracy of personal information, we only need to view and refer to the personal file. The compensation administrator has the right to view personal archives.In Figure4, you can also see the process of compensation administrator consulting personal archives. According to the results of file reading, manually modify the received push data through entity 3 \"input and import module.\" Then, the administrator should apply the compensation policy according to the above personal file information, manually calculate the standard value of each compensation, and fill in the system. After that, we can call the verification system of entity 4 to verify the compensation standard value. So why not use the computer to calculate the compensation standard in the first place? This is because some items in the compensation cannot be completely calculated by computer and must be judged by comprehensive manual work.3.4.2. Determination and Adjustment of Social Security Payment BaseThrough the above steps, a new employee's monthly compensation standard has been determined. According to this compensation standard, the social security payment base can be calculated. Enter the social security payment base into the social security management program of entity 9, you can get the payment amount of social security and provident fund and store it. At the same time, the social security management program can automatically calculate the social security payment base of all employees in the current year"
"of entity 9, you can get the payment amount of social security and provident fund and store it. At the same time, the social security management program can automatically calculate the social security payment base of all employees in the current year according to the actual payroll data of the previous year and automatically complete the adjustment of the payment amount of the whole staff and the whole project once a year.3.4.3. Monthly Compensation Issuing and Summarizing ProcessThere are two main functions of this MIS: one is the management of compensation standard, and the other is the management of monthly compensation issuing process. The system entity 12 module of review and sign process for compensation issuing is the entry of compensation payment process. According to the policy of Donghua University, the national compensation is managed by the compensation administrator of the university, while the school allowance is managed by the faculty/department and reviewed by the compensation administrator. This approval process is mainly for the school allowance. The faculty/department secretary makes a record of this part of the compensation and initiates the process. After the approval of the dean/director and the approval of the compensation administrator, this part of the compensation will enter into the payroll to be paid this month. In the figure, we can also see that the part of national compensation is directly recorded by the compensation administrator according to"
"of the compensation administrator, this part of the compensation will enter into the payroll to be paid this month. In the figure, we can also see that the part of national compensation is directly recorded by the compensation administrator according to the information in the personal compensation standard database, combined with the actual situation of this month, and entered into the compensation database to be paid this month.After obtaining all the compensation information to be paid this month, through the entity 13 compensation payment and docking module, the compensation information to be paid is pushed through the school unified platform, such as MIS for finance. After that, the compensation is paid to each teacher through the financial system.Therefore, after the payment is completed, the paid out amount can be imported into the MIS through the closed-loop system, and then, the actual payroll data can be compared with the data of compensation that await to issue. In addition, the actual payroll data is also an important basis for the program modules of entities 9, 15, and 16.3.4.4. Faculty Life Cycle ManagementFrom the data flow process in Figure4, we can see that from the beginning of employment to retirement or even death, the school will pay the teachers the relevant treatment in each period. Therefore, the whole life cycle management of employees is also a feature of personnel management in Chinese universities.When the employee's compensation standard"
"or even death, the school will pay the teachers the relevant treatment in each period. Therefore, the whole life cycle management of employees is also a feature of personnel management in Chinese universities.When the employee's compensation standard information system is transferred from the on-the-job management system, 10 employees will retire. Because our school has a special retiree management system, so this subsystem mainly plays the role of the link between this MIS and the retirement MIS and can complete some basic retiree information storage and management work. After that, the relevant information of retirees will be pushed to the special retirement MIS through the school platform for the management of the retirement management office.When a retired teacher dies, the system will read the retiree's information through the entity 11 pension management module, calculate the teacher's pension amount according to the policy, and then transfer it to the financial MIS to complete the pension payment.4. The Function and Effect of MNC-MISThe system design fully shows the advantages of computer application in personnel management and provides the system users with as much convenience as possible, such as fast retrieval, comprehensive data, closely following policy, closed-loop management, and personalized operation.(1)The data format is unified, and the data exchange is accurate and standardThe data format is unified in two aspects:First, on the aspect of whole school. The"
"data, closely following policy, closed-loop management, and personalized operation.(1)The data format is unified, and the data exchange is accurate and standardThe data format is unified in two aspects:First, on the aspect of whole school. The system follows the data specification of the unified information platform of the school and can achieve the data docking with other MIS of the school through the unified data bus of the university information platform. The system level data exchange is fast and accurate.Second, on the aspect of the system itself. There are several main databases and several subdatabases in the system. All databases follow the data protocol agreed in the system. Through the design of this specification, not only the unity of the system data is ensured but also the scalability of the system data is ensured.(2)The design of data structure emphasizes integrity and comprehensiveness, which meets the needs of compensation management in universitiesData structure design in line with the principle of \"can be complete, can be detailed,\" let the data field be as complete as possible. Data management is based on the principle of more and more, recording every change and every adjustment truthfully and carefully. Because every field, every adjustment, may have an impact on a teacher's subsequent compensation. For example, in some specific cases, two teachers who are consistent in all aspects have only one promotion time difference of one month. This month may"
"Because every field, every adjustment, may have an impact on a teacher's subsequent compensation. For example, in some specific cases, two teachers who are consistent in all aspects have only one promotion time difference of one month. This month may bring a gap between the two teachers' salaries in a future compensation adjustment. The emphasis of data integrity and comprehensiveness in this system is the best preparation for such a situation.(3)To achieve the machine language of compensation policy at all levels and fully achieve the policy adjustment of university compensationThis paper has repeatedly emphasized the characteristics of a strong policy focus of university compensation. Governments at all levels, such as the state, provinces, and cities, have issued a lot of compensation policies, which have been edited into a book and distributed to the compensation administrators of colleges and universities. This system transforms these policies written in natural language into machine language, which means that the computer has learned these policies. Then, the computer can complete all kinds of compensation promotion and adjustment according to these policies.At the same time, the compensation policy is constantly changing, and the system also retains the interface, allowing the entry of new machine language policy procedures without changing the source code, ensuring the continuity and scalability of the policy.(4)The closed-loop management of the whole process of"
"changing, and the system also retains the interface, allowing the entry of new machine language policy procedures without changing the source code, ensuring the continuity and scalability of the policy.(4)The closed-loop management of the whole process of compensation management is achievedThe whole process of university compensation management can be closed-loop in this system. From the compensation starting of new employees, to the determination of compensation standard, to the payment of compensation, to the payment of social security and provident fund, to the summary of actual payroll data, to the review of compensation standard, and finally to statistics and statements. The data of compensation achieves a big close loop. In these large cycles, there are also some small cycles, such as the compensation standard verification process and the social security payment base determination process, which are all small closed-loop cycles in the system. The process of data circulation is the process of compensation management, and the comprehensive informatization of these processes also marks the comprehensive informatization of compensation management, which is the embodiment of efficient, accurate, and professional compensation management in colleges and universities.(5)Data statistics and report results are instant, convenient, and accurateThanks to the unified data format, comprehensive data content, and sufficient policy learning, the process of data statistics and data"
"management in colleges and universities.(5)Data statistics and report results are instant, convenient, and accurateThanks to the unified data format, comprehensive data content, and sufficient policy learning, the process of data statistics and data report generation is efficient and accurate. This process is like a sports car with a well-maintained engine, full oil tank, and shiny body parked in the garage and ready to go. When the driver wants to drive, he or she can go straight away and become a beautiful scenery on the road.(6)Definable and extensible operation interface, flexible personalityThe menu module of MIS supports creation and adjustment, and the operation interface also supports multidimensional configuration. Through the personalized design and adjustment, we can create the most user-friendly interface and give users a good experience.(7)The factors affecting MNC-MISAlthough MNC-MIS has many advantages, some factors will affect the performance of the system. For example, the bandwidth and security [21] of each network, the performance of the server, the completeness and accuracy of the original salary data, the clarity of salary-related policies, and the speed of policy communication.To sum up, the MNC-MIS is a system engineering with high design requirements, great development difficulty, and strong technical requirements.

"AbstractThe traditional university education and teaching management information system has the problems of low information recall, poor information precision, and long query time. Therefore, this paper designs a university education and teaching management information system based on Web. Through the analysis of the requirements of the higher education and teaching management information system, the design principle of the system is determined, and the structure design of the higher education and teaching management information system is realized; the teaching management information system management process is determined. By calculating the complexity of university education and teaching management information, the priority of query information is determined to effectively improve the processing effect of the system. Finally, the relational database model is designed to realize the design of university education and teaching management information system. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, comparative experiments are designed. Experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the low information recall and the poor information precision and shorten the query time.1.

"popularization of CERNET in all kinds of schools and education management departments at all levels in China, the information construction of education management has entered a new stage of development. The campus network based on Internet technology has gradually broken the original closed and independent management mode of education management and started to transform to an interconnected and open system [1]. However, the current research on teaching management information system has begun to take shape, but the actual application is still in its infancy [2]. In addition to the insufficient investment in education funds and the weak basic environment of school informatization, the main reasons are as follows: ① The lack of standards for teaching management information system results in great data redundancy and waste of resources, which makes it difficult to realize resource sharing and system interoperability; or just standardizing data cannot solve the problem of interoperability between different systems. Many original independent teaching management information systems have made outstanding contributions to the scientization of education management. However, due to the mutual closure and independent operation of teaching, finance, personnel, equipment, scientific research, and other single management systems developed in different periods and departments, it not only causes great data redundancy and resource waste but also makes it difficult to realize information"
"finance, personnel, equipment, scientific research, and other single management systems developed in different periods and departments, it not only causes great data redundancy and resource waste but also makes it difficult to realize information sharing through the network [3]. ② The information quality of educational administrators is relatively backward; in particular, whether the leading cadres at all levels have the awareness of modern information management is the key factor in the development and application of campus network management information system. If school leaders and education administrators do not have the awareness of modern information management and lack of understanding of the role and characteristics of modern information management, they will not pay attention to and care about the development and use of teaching management information system, which will bring about insurmountable obstacles to the development and application of the system [4]. Recently, some schools even have established a relatively perfect teaching management information system, but, due to the defects of some managers in consciousness, ability, and other aspects, as well as the role of conservative factors in the work process, the teaching management information system cannot be fully used and developed.Relevant scholars have made some progress in this field. Shi and others proposed the design of university teaching management information system based on MVP mode [5]. The system"
"teaching management information system cannot be fully used and developed.Relevant scholars have made some progress in this field. Shi and others proposed the design of university teaching management information system based on MVP mode [5]. The system adopts the more advanced MVP (Model View Presenter) software design mode and divides the system framework into three layers: model (business logic layer), presenter (moderator layer), and view (view layer). On the basis of the system framework, the hardware used in the system is introduced in detail, including the main control chip and communication network. According to the functional requirements of the system, the system is mainly divided into login module, teacher management module, student management module, public management module, daily management module of educational administration, and system management module, and the throughput performance of the system is compared and analyzed. The results show the following: when 20000 people visit the system at the same time, QPS (queries per second), concurrency number, the number of queries per second, the average response time, and other parameters meet the throughput requirements of the system.

"the course of management information system based on the BOPPPS model [6]. In view of the characteristics and problems of the course content of management information system, this paper tries to introduce the BOPPPS learning mode into the management information system classroom and takes the chapter \"business information system in career,\" which is more comprehensive and difficult to teach, as an example to design the teaching of BOPPPS, so as to achieve interaction and high efficiency. At the same time, it further discusses the specific path and matters needing attention to promote the interactive learning advocated by BOPPPS learning mode and the concept of course modularization to other courses in business school. GanQihong et al. Proposed the design and implementation of university teaching equipment management system based on SSM framework [7]. It is of great significance to use information technology to support teaching equipment management and help the whole process of fine management reform of teaching equipment. The system technology architecture based on SSM framework is built. Finally, the key algorithms and system examples in the development of the system are given. The experimental test shows that the system includes three functional modules of equipment information management, maintenance management, and operation management, which can realize the informatization of teaching equipment, the whole process, and fine management, and lays the foundation for"
"includes three functional modules of equipment information management, maintenance management, and operation management, which can realize the informatization of teaching equipment, the whole process, and fine management, and lays the foundation for intelligent management.Information security management refers to the establishment of information security policies and objectives in the overall or specific scope. The organization is required to establish an information security management system by determining the scope of the information security management system, formulating the information security policy, clarifying the management responsibilities, and choosing control objectives and control methods based on risk assessment. To get a truly comprehensive cloud computing service, security is a priority. At the same time, how to better establish the enterprise's own information security management has become the focus of the industry.However, there are some problems in the above methods, such as poor data recall and long query time. Therefore, this paper proposes a Web-based university education and teaching management information system. It is a comprehensive teaching management software system which takes teaching management as the core and integrates educational administration management, student status management, teacher student management, school production management, book management, and system management. Through the network teaching management information system,"
"as the core and integrates educational administration management, student status management, teacher student management, school production management, book management, and system management. Through the network teaching management information system, education administrators, teachers, and students can query, analyze, and process the information in the process of education anytime and anywhere, so as to accurately and timely reflect the current state of the school′s work, use the past data to predict the future, and assist the school′s functional departments and principals to manage the school from the overall situation. The network teaching management information system also has a clear meaning of the times, which can meet the requirements of the change of work style in the information age and realize the requirements of informatization, scientization, and modernization of school management to meet the needs of assisting school administrators to make correct decisions.Our contribution is threefold:(1)The traditional university education and teaching management information system has the problems of low information recall, poor information precision, and long query time.

Information System of Education and Teaching Management Based on Web2.1. System Requirement AnalysisSystem demand analysis is one of the most important links in the system development. It is the basis of analysis and design to investigate comprehensively from facts. System requirements analysis is an important document in the system analysis stage, it is a milestone, marking the end of the analysis phase, and it is the starting point and basis of the system design stage. It determines whether the next stage of system development can be smoothly carried out, and it is also a contract, which defines the new system that"
"marking the end of the analysis phase, and it is the starting point and basis of the system design stage. It determines whether the next stage of system development can be smoothly carried out, and it is also a contract, which defines the new system that the system developer must deliver to the user [8]. In addition, according to the research of Boehm, the demand of software, its application scope, and its complexity are growing continuously without limitation; 85% of the resources consumed need management, design, testing, planning, project management control, change management, and tool development, which need to be considered with equal importance. Only 15 percent of software development work is dedicated to coding. Thus, how important the demand analysis is can be seen. The purpose of system analysis is to determine the user's requirements and solutions, including the developer's understanding of the existing organizational management status. The user needs the function of information system: data business process, management function, and management data index system. The new system is to be modified and the new management model is added.On the basis of extensive demand survey, the research group determines the overall function of the system, divides the system into various functional modules according to the overall function of the system, and determines the methods to realize various functions. The system adopts the combination of B/S mode and C/S mode, which is a new"
"function of the system, divides the system into various functional modules according to the overall function of the system, and determines the methods to realize various functions. The system adopts the combination of B/S mode and C/S mode, which is a new software architecture. Not only is it conducive to the sharing of information resources, easy to operate, and upgradable and maintainable, but also it ensures the data security to a certain extent [9]. The database adopts Microsoft SQL Server 2000, which is easy to use and provides support for massive data; Dreamweaver MX 2004 is used as the design platform, asp.net Web database middleware technology is used to develop Web pages, and ADO (active X data object) technology and OLEDB are used to connect and access the database. Most of the pages of the system add instructions or tips to facilitate users to use the functions provided by the system. Users can operate the system well by simple input or selection.2.2. Design Principle of the System(1)System Positioning. When establishing a network information system, we must first make clear who the service object of the system is and what aspects of management the system should mainly complete [10]. For different objects and different user groups, the function of the system has different requirements.(2)System Scale. The scale of the system has a great influence on the overall scheme of the system and the performance requirements of the software and hardware in the system. The"
"user groups, the function of the system has different requirements.(2)System Scale. The scale of the system has a great influence on the overall scheme of the system and the performance requirements of the software and hardware in the system. The system scale mainly refers to the number of system users, the amount of data processing, the number of functional modules, and so on. It can be said that the scale of the system will affect the overall technical solution of the system to some extent. In addition, the scale of the system also has requirements for the software and hardware of the system [11]. If there are few users in the system, the processing speed of the server, the number of ports of the switch, and the transmission rate of the backbone network can be relatively small. On the contrary, the high-speed server, the switch with more ports, and the backbone network with higher transmission rate must be used.(3)The Advanced Nature and Rationality of Technology. Generally speaking, the development system is expected to have the best technology and the most powerful function. In the actual system design, we should consider the advanced factors of the technology and the rationality of the practical application according to the comprehensive factors, such as system location and system scale, so as to achieve the optimal performance price ratio [12].(4)System Security. This is one of the most important and core technologies of the network development system. To realize the"
"to the comprehensive factors, such as system location and system scale, so as to achieve the optimal performance price ratio [12].(4)System Security. This is one of the most important and core technologies of the network development system. To realize the information management system in the network environment, it is necessary to manage every login user account and provide a security mechanism [13].(5)Good Interaction. Good interactivity can realize resource sharing and timely information processing, which requires a user interface that is easy to operate and intuitive.In conclusion, the system function should be determined according to the system positioning and system scale in the system design, and then different specific implementation technologies should be selected according to the specific functional requirements.2.3. Structure Design of the SystemThe system adopts modular structure, and the division and design of each module strictly follow the principle of high cohesion and low coupling [14]. Each submodule is called by the main module, and each submodule completes a relatively independent function. Each submodule can be developed, tested, and modified independently and finally forms the whole system, so the system has good scalability. The system is divided into eight modules; the system structure is shown in Figure1, and the system flow chart is shown in Figure2.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem structure diagram.Figure 2Open in figure"

Database Design of the Management Information System for College Education and Teaching4.1.

"of university education and teaching management information system is divided into two parts: the general control center database and the subcontrol center database.The database of the main control center is the core part of the remote network teaching system. It is particularly important to support the operation of the whole system. In order to efficiently integrate all the information and resource data of the whole system, the capacity, stability, and operation efficiency of the database must be fully considered in the construction of the database of the general control center. In order to make the main control center database able to effectively meet the daily information reading, backup, and other needs, one way is to select the appropriate hardware platform to provide the necessary hardware support for the system, and another is to select an efficient and stable database management system to realize the complete management of data. Database construction is the core part of the network distance education system, which plays a vital role. From the functional point of view, it mainly covers system use case analysis, data management, financial management, identity authentication, security management, and so on.

"data storage point of the whole system, the central host system of the system construction manages and processes the data storage and transmission of the whole system. The system design adopts a typical three-tier system architecture. In its architecture design, it covers two functional servers: central database server and teaching management platform. Among them, teaching management platform includes data management server, security server, identity authentication server, and other related equipment servers.4.2. Relational Database ModelThe logic structure of the system is divided into two types: conceptual mode and external mode. According to these two modes, the database design of the system can be carried out, and the object patterns can be transformed into fictitious database tables to get the table pattern (conceptual model). External tables (external models) can be associated with table models through database views or interface programs. Finally, the concept table is converted to an internal pattern, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointTransformation of object model and database model.5. Experiment5.1.

"AbstractIn order to solve the problems of low efficiency of management information systems and low utilization rate of the information resources, this research paper proposes the designs of an exhibition management information system by using a B/S structure (Browser/Server mode). The proposed system is aimed at the analysis of functions and types of exhibitions. The system is comprised of the following three components: the browser-side, server-side, and middle layer. Among them, the browser includes a user management module and exhibition environment visualization module. The server includes an upper computer control module and human-computer interaction module. The middle layer includes the data resource management module, document information management module, exhibition project audit approval and management module, and information scheduling module. Experimental results show that the lowest management efficiency of the system is 96.19%, the highest can reach 98.39%, and the utilization rate of information resources is above 94%, indicating that the system has achieved the design expectation.1.

"activities. Its conceptual connotation refers to mass social activities that are formed by many people gathering together in a certain geographical space to transmit and exchange information regularly or irregularly, systematically or unsystematically. The extension of its concept includes various types of expositions, exhibition and sales activities, conferences of large, medium, and small sizes, cultural activities, and festival activities [1]. Among them, the exhibition with a specific theme refers to the gathering and communication activities of people around a specific theme in a specific time and space. The narrow sense of exhibition only refers to exhibitions and conferences; in the broad sense, exhibition is a general term for conferences, exhibitions, festival activities, and all kinds of industrial/industry-related exhibitions. Conference, exhibition, exposition, and trade fair are the basic forms of exhibition activities; the world exposition is the most typical exhibition activity.With the continuous improvement of China's comprehensive economic strength, the exhibition industry has been rapidly developed. There are various types of exhibitions, promoting the exchange and development of various fields. Modern exhibition content covers multiple components; the venue is composed of multiple venues with different functions, and the number of participants is large and has different types.

"exhibition content covers multiple components; the venue is composed of multiple venues with different functions, and the number of participants is large and has different types. At present, the domestic exhibition industry chain has been quite perfect [2].Exhibition service management is an essential emerging field in the development of the modern service industry, which is at the core of the exhibition industry chain and determines the success or failure of the whole exhibition work. The exhibition industry is the sunrise enterprise in the competitive market. With the improving Internet technology and popularization, the digital and intelligent development has already become the inevitable trend of exhibition industry development; the traditional pattern of convention and exhibition services have been unable to meet the demands of exhibitors' and visitors' service experience; combined with information technology, the innovation exhibition service can effectively improve the service efficiency and quality. Therefore, exhibition enterprises should actively explore intelligent innovation paths and optimize and transform exhibition services, so as to promote sustainable development of the exhibition industry [3].To this end, relevant scholars designed an exhibition industry integration management system based on the \"cloud + VR\" technology [4]. In the context of the integrated development of \"Internet +\" and the exhibition industry, emerging technologies such as big data,"
"relevant scholars designed an exhibition industry integration management system based on the \"cloud + VR\" technology [4]. In the context of the integrated development of \"Internet +\" and the exhibition industry, emerging technologies such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are actively related to the exhibition industry and penetrating effect, in order to find their own new industrial form. As a result, the system integration model as a theoretical basis, based on the analysis of cloud +, VR technology, and exhibition industry development, on the basis of the theory construction, model build, and build fusion architecture, is divided into three aspects: the theoretical framework and research strategy, using the entropy method and coupling coordination degree model, demonstrate its fusion effect and try to induce the coupling coordination problems. It provides a theoretical basis for creating new digital management. In addition, some scholars proposed an intelligent exhibition service management system based on IPA analysis and optimization [5]. The system is based on technical support, user interaction, and performance of the system of three dimensions and 11 indexes of evaluation, and using the IPA method analysis of the present situation of exhibition service platform wisdom, we found users for application compatibility, update information timely, and convenient entry registration and navigation positioning precision indexes such as the value and"
"method analysis of the present situation of exhibition service platform wisdom, we found users for application compatibility, update information timely, and convenient entry registration and navigation positioning precision indexes such as the value and satisfaction are higher. They are more satisfied with the clear and reasonable interface layout. They are less satisfied with the importance of multilanguage service, responsiveness of communication and interaction, reliability of peripheral recommendation, and patency of Wi-Fi use. They are more satisfied with the importance of privacy and convenience of transaction service. It considers the wisdom of convention and exhibition service management should be further optimized in keeping the application compatibility, update information, and registration; it has the advantages of navigation and positioning at the same time, focusing on strengthening the users' privacy protection, being convenient to provide professional services, giving attention to two or more things such as interface layout, multilingual services, and interactions, and recommending and using Wi-Fi improvement and perfection.Recently, in [6], a new exhibition management information system is proposed which is simple, easily extendable, and of low cost.

"is simple, easily extendable, and of low cost. It is used for correspondence between the exhibition center and its different stakeholders. Similarly, in [7], an intelligent exhibition guidance service-based system is proposed which makes use of dynamic customer experience. In [8], a central control system in a smart exhibition hall is designed which supports innovation at the application level.However, in practical application, it is found that the traditional exhibition service management system has some problems such as low management efficiency, low resource utilization rate, and poor system operation stability. In order to effectively alleviate this problem, a new exhibition analysis service management system is designed and put into use.In this research article, an exhibition management information system is proposed by using a B/S structure (Browser/Server mode). This system is comprised of the following three components: the browser-side, server-side, and middle layer.

"module, document information management module, exhibition project audit approval and management module, and information scheduling module.2. Relevant Analysis of Exhibition IndustryAt present, the origin of exhibition is still being discussed and studied, and there is no unified and positive view. There are roughly \"market evolution\" theory, \"witchcraft etiquette and sacrifice\" theory, and \"barter\" theory. Therefore, we can believe that exhibition develops with the progress of society's economy, politics, and culture and exists and develops perfectly around people's material and spiritual needs [9].2.1. Functions of ExhibitionExhibition has powerful economic functions, including connection and transaction function, integrated marketing function, supply and demand regulation function, technology diffusion function, industrial linkage function, and promoting economic integration.(a)Connection and transaction functions: contact and transaction function exhibition breeds huge business opportunities. The communication function of exhibition is very obvious: the amount of contact is large; the contact area is wide; and the connection effect is good. Therefore, exhibition can provide the organizer, exhibitors, and visitors with the opportunity to contact and communicate with each other [10]. During a limited event period of only a few days, exhibitors often have access to most customers of the entire industry or market, perhaps more than in a year or even years through"
"with the opportunity to contact and communicate with each other [10]. During a limited event period of only a few days, exhibitors often have access to most customers of the entire industry or market, perhaps more than in a year or even years through conventional means such as house visits. In the professional exhibition, the exhibition participants can contact leaders of the competent departments of the industry, experts in the field, existing customers, potential customers, suppliers, agents, users, and other relevant people in various roles, including decision makers and key people, forming high interpersonal contact quality. The elegant atmosphere of the exhibition is conducive to high-quality communication [11].(b)Integrated marketing function: as an effective marketing platform between enterprises, exhibition provides a bridge and link for enterprises to display products, collect information, negotiate trade, exchange technology, and expand the market. Exhibition is playing an increasingly important role in the marketing strategy of enterprises. In developed countries, exhibition marketing has become an important marketing means for many enterprises [12]. At the same time, the exhibition economy is a kind of economic competition. Many suppliers and demanders gather together to directly exchange supply and demand information. This is a market that is close to perfect competition, and the law of market value can play the greatest role [13].(c)Function of regulating"
"competition. Many suppliers and demanders gather together to directly exchange supply and demand information. This is a market that is close to perfect competition, and the law of market value can play the greatest role [13].(c)Function of regulating supply and demand: the function of regulating supply and demand exhibition can be regarded as information market, information can be exchanged, and the information of enterprises participating in the products is market information and is an important resource of the market economy.(d)Technology diffusion function: in the technology diffusion functions, the exhibition organizations are adopting to the innovations in the business processes.(e)The industrial linkage function: it includes information, components, raw materials, finished goods, and transport links between the exhibition service providers and the organizations.(f)Economic integration: it reduces the costs of the exhibitors and improves the availability of goods and services to the clients' organizations and individuals.Information market is the pivot of the economic operation cycle. The exhibition information market reflects the information exchange between supply and demand in a variety of economic relations; it connects the market information provider, market information users, and important production factors such as market information resource applications to promote all kinds of market resources to optimize configuration, effectively stimulate demand, and adjust"
"the market information provider, market information users, and important production factors such as market information resource applications to promote all kinds of market resources to optimize configuration, effectively stimulate demand, and adjust the supply.2.2. Classification of Exhibitions(1)According to the nature of exhibition, projects can be divided into trade exhibition projects and consumer exhibition projects:(a)trade exhibition project is indicating to the manufacturing industry; in business and other industries at the exhibition, exhibitors and visitors are businessmen; exhibitors can be industry manufacturers, traders, wholesalers, distributors, agents, and other related units; visitors are mainly used to invite buyers, while general audiences have been excluded. The ultimate purpose of the exhibition is to reach a deal [14].(b)Consumer exhibition projects refer to the exhibition activities held for the public. Most of these exhibition projects are of local nature, and the exhibition content is mainly of consumer goods, attracting audiences through mass media such as TELEVISION, radio, newspapers and magazines, and the Internet. The audience is mainly consumers; consumers need to buy tickets to enter. This kind of program attaches great importance to the number of audience. Consumer exhibition is shown in Figure1.(c)The main criterion to distinguish exhibition projects from trade or consumption is the composition of the audience, that is, whether the audience"
"of program attaches great importance to the number of audience. Consumer exhibition is shown in Figure1.(c)The main criterion to distinguish exhibition projects from trade or consumption is the composition of the audience, that is, whether the audience is traders or ordinary consumers, rather than the exhibits, that is, industrial products or consumer goods.(2)According to the content of exhibition projects, they can be divided into comprehensive exhibition projects and professional exhibition projects:(d)Comprehensive exhibition refers to the exhibition including the whole industry or several industries, also known as horizontal exhibition, such as heavy industry exhibition light industry exhibition(e)Professional exhibition refers to an exhibition that displays a certain industry or even a certain product such as watch exhibition [15]Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointScene of consumer exhibition.In recent years, the rapid development of the exhibition industry has shown that it should not be an underestimated industry; in the more and more mature market economy environment, how to supervise and guide the standard development of the exhibition industry has become a key problem to be solved. The original multihead examination and approval system no longer meets the development needs of the exhibition industry, and only indirect regulation and guidance through regulations and industry standards can guarantee its benign development [16].3.

"examination and approval system no longer meets the development needs of the exhibition industry, and only indirect regulation and guidance through regulations and industry standards can guarantee its benign development [16].3. Exhibition Analysis Service Management System DesignOn the basis of the abovementioned analysis, this study designs an exhibition analysis service management system for comprehensive exhibition projects, which mainly uses the B/S structure. This paper constructs the system data structure, function modules, and operation flow. The B/S structure not only simplifies the workload of the system but also supports the distributed processing of exhibition data and information, which effectively reduces the cost of information management. At the same time, clients with a three-tier B/S architecture are more versatile, less dependent on the application environment, and can effectively provide system management efficiency. The B/S structure is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointB/S structure (Browser/Server mode) diagram.In the abovementioned B/S structure, the exhibition analysis service management system can be divided into three parts: the browser-side, server-side, and middle layer.

"The detailed analysis is carried out as follows:(1)Browser layer: this layer is combined with the data structure of exhibition resources, and it can provide data services, transmit service results to the middle layer, and store data on the server side including the user management module and exhibition environmental visualization module.(2)Server-side layer: this layer mainly runs various application services, can receive the browser side of the information management request, and can display the request processing results. In this study, the corresponding running process is embedded in the server and the connection between the system modules is established including the upper computer control module and human-computer interaction module.(3)Middle layer: this layer mainly realizes data management functions and can receive user requests, send requests to the server, and then, return service results to users. It includes the data resource management module, document information management module, exhibition project audit and management module, and information scheduling module.3.1. Browser3.1.1.

Exhibition Environment Visualization ModuleThis study analyzes the types and behavioral patterns of participants and possible abnormal events by combining time, space, speed, and other attributes, so as to help the exhibition organizers review the overall situation of the exhibition more easily and effectively, have insight into the spatial behavior of participants, find relevant deficiencies, and improve the management level in the future. Therefore, the design of views in this paper mainly follows the following two principles: views accurately display the complex information contained in data; views are clear and intuitive, reducing the users' burden of understanding and cognition of data.The exhibition environment visualization module is mainly composed of a three-dimensional map, global situation map, track playback map, track Gantt chart, speed Gantt chart, duration Gantt chart, control panel, and line chart of population change [17]. Due to the complexity of data, it is difficult to directly display the results by machine processing data to meet the needs of users. Therefore, a multiview association analysis is necessary, and rich interaction can also make users enjoy the fun of exploration.

Server SideThe exhibition service management system of the server side includes the PC control module and human-computer interaction module, on this basis, the output of the set system bus protocol, combining cross-compilation control technology for a PC control, and an intelligent design of human-computer interaction, so as to build the server running model, and uses the upper machine communication method for network design.At the same time, considering the working characteristics of the exhibition analysis service management system, the protocol communication and interactive process output transformation control are designed by the database scheduling method, and the bus is developed and designed by the ITU-656 PPI pattern recognition method.3.3. The Middle TierThis section describes different modules and components of the middle tier.3.3.1.

Document Information Management ModuleThe document information management module is mainly responsible for the information management of the document class. In the document information management module, the two core functions are document delivery and document approval, and efficient document delivery and document approval are also the basis to ensure the normal operation of the system [19].First of all, relevant staff needs to input new exhibition resource information into the system, so that managers can query the new information in real time. At the same time, information modeling of exhibition resources is also needed to ensure the efficiency and practicability of information management through the establishment of a database.In the exhibition resource database, the data are divided into spatial data and attribute data, and then, the data matrix is constructed and expressed as follows:(4)wheremrepresents the total amount of exhibition data resources andnrepresents the attribute elements of exhibition data resources.

Exhibition Project Audit Approval and Management ModuleThe exhibition project audit initiation and management module of the exhibition analysis service management system contains two executive roles: an ordinary user and administrator user. In addition, the two user roles have different operation and processing rights for many application functions, such as project initiation, project deletion, project modification, and audit scheme setting. Among them, the application for exhibition project approval refers to the process of information input, project plan upload, project application form filling, etc., carried out by the project initiator for the exhibition project. During the implementation of the application instruction for project approval, all project objects must maintain an independent connection state. When implementing the modification instruction of exhibition projects, an administrator user can face multiple audit objects of different exhibition projects at the same time and establish multiple new project files while summarizing the projects to be audited. Ordinary users have"

Ordinary users have the right to upload project application forms and project plan documents related to the audit business of exhibition projects on the application information interface, and the \"batch project approval\" clause should be established for individual project objects, and mining association rules can be established based on this.The operation principle of exhibition project audit is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperation principle of the audit project initiation module of the exhibition project.On this basis, the management function of exhibition project audit files mainly has four basic execution requirements of query, increase, delete, and modify, which can match different operation rights of exhibition project audit and management for administrator users and ordinary users, respectively. Administrators or ordinary users first log in to the system operation interface with the help of the BP neural network and then click the file management button to enter the system's core file management interface. Logged-in users can select relevant documents of the exhibition project they want to view according to their personal query needs and then transmit the final query results back to the main control interface of the"

"AbstractWith the development of the digital economy and the sharp increase in economic information, a large amount of data needs to be processed. Therefore, the demand for an economic management information system is also increasing, but how to realize the allocation of data resources in the system has become an urgent problem to be solved. This study conducts research on the above problems, first analyzes the research results of domestic and foreign scholars, finds out the content suitable for this research, and then introduces the structure of the economic management information system and the method of data resource allocation in detail. Finally, by comparing and testing the algorithm of data resource allocation and other allocation algorithms, it is concluded that the allocation algorithm used in this study is more effective than the research algorithm of previous scholars, thus proving the feasibility of this research. The test results show that the number of protocol function modules allocated by the GAA algorithm is 20% to 30% less than that of the RAA algorithm. So, it can be concluded that compared with the RAA algorithm, the GAA algorithm saves more network resources.1.

Therefore, the research work on the SDN network resource allocation method is crucial.The innovation of this study is that(1)Compared with previous research work, most of the controller deployment schemes based on software-defined networking (SDN) are considered from the perspectives of reducing propagation delay, load balancing between controllers, and improving reliability. This study focuses on the problem of signaling overhead between controllers when users receive management from different controllers in the process of frequent random movement. Taking the user's moving behavior as the similarity, the spectral clustering algorithm is used to implement the controller deployment.(2)Since the total number of protocol function blocks is reduced, the network can save a lot of transmission computing resources for other service flows, thereby improving the overall resource utilization of the network. Therefore, on this basis, this study focuses on how to allocate the minimum number of protocol function modules to each type of request in a time-limited network.(3)This study takes the macroeconomic"
