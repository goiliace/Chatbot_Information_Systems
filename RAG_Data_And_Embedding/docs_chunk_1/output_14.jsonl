Optimization of Human Resource Performance ManagementThe core problem of the company's performance implementation is that the performance team processes the performance data manually through Excel office software, which cannot avoid the problems of low processing efficiency and lagging performance feedback results. The implementation of the human resource performance management information system using big data technology can greatly improve the processing efficiency without the interference of manual processing errors. It also improves the accuracy and recognition of performance results. At the same time, the application of human"
"system using big data technology can greatly improve the processing efficiency without the interference of manual processing errors. It also improves the accuracy and recognition of performance results. At the same time, the application of human resource performance management information system to process performance data also solves the problem of long-term and high-intensity work pressure of performance team. In addition, the performance early warning function developed in the human resources performance management information system realizes the synchronous combination of the performance team and the business team by sharing the information flow, and the performance information is fed back to the business department in real time to realize the business department's independent correction.To realize the early warning function of human resources performance management information system, we first need the evaluation system of performance early warning. The evaluation system of early warning indicators should be a subsystem of the performance appraisal indicator system, which is the decomposition indicator of performance appraisal indicators. Second, a reasonable early warning data processing method is needed, that is, set a reasonable early warning data processing model, such as binary logic model and fuzzy judgment model, select the processing model according to the relevant index types, and then judge the current performance level through the early warning data"
"is, set a reasonable early warning data processing model, such as binary logic model and fuzzy judgment model, select the processing model according to the relevant index types, and then judge the current performance level through the early warning data processing model. Finally, the ultimate purpose of the early warning function is to ensure the completion of performance objectives. When the performance early warning is abnormal, the system will analyze the alarm source of the early warning results and formulate treatment countermeasures for employees and managers to correct performance errors in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe sketch of employee in different positions.As shown in Figure10, the current situation and characteristics of the company's human resources make the company have the following problems in human resource management.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointEmployee's educational background sketch.The talent flow rate is high. This is mainly due to the lack of effective incentive mechanism. At the same time, as a market-oriented communication equipment manufacturing joint venture, the company is bound to adjust its organizational structure, market strategy, and product direction according to market fluctuations, which will lead to the flow of employees.The talent team is relatively young.

"to market fluctuations, which will lead to the flow of employees.The talent team is relatively young. This has both advantages and disadvantages for enterprises: the advantage is that if it can be used correctly, it can enable enterprises to embark on the road of rapid development. However, if they feel that they cannot learn anything new in the organization, they are easy to change jobs and cause losses to the enterprise.Lack of perfect salary system and incentive mechanism. This is mainly reflected in that the incentive content is too single, often based on money incentive, and there are few other spiritual incentives. Wages cannot reflect the difference between the values of different posts. There is no clear payment standard for benefit salary, which is generally paid together with the bonus at the end of the year. Usually, it is only a fixed level salary, which is not incentive enough.Lack of standardized personnel training system. Generally, only shallow training is carried out, and there is little talent development training. Due to the lack of training in the company, new employees cannot quickly integrate into the enterprise, and the cohesion is poor;R&Dpersonnel cannot keep up with the trend of technology development, and the technology is weakened. The marketing personnel do not understand the product situation, and the market development and service capacity are insufficient.

"and the technology is weakened. The marketing personnel do not understand the product situation, and the market development and service capacity are insufficient. The overall competitiveness of the company is weakening because many managers cannot keep up with their management skills after transferring from technical posts.In view of the problems existing in human resource management, the company has made corresponding improvements in combination with its own actual situation. In each fiscal year, the human resources department and the finance department, together with each product group and department, will communicate with each department on post function adjustment, head count, and KPI assessment indicators detailed to each employee according to the business and functional objectives of the second year, so as to determine the final staffing and budget information, which will be implemented at the beginning of the second fiscal year.Each secondary and tertiary department of the company has a human resources manager assigned by the company, who is responsible for providing support in daily work: recruiting employees, signing and managing labor contracts, handling procedures and induction training for new employees, determining employee compensation, implementing the company's welfare policies, etc. together with department leaders, and fine-tuning the plan formulated at the beginning of the year according to the actual situation.

"employee compensation, implementing the company's welfare policies, etc. together with department leaders, and fine-tuning the plan formulated at the beginning of the year according to the actual situation. More importantly, for the KPI assessment of employees, the human resources department works closely with all departments to implement the assessment as fairly and fairly as possible. At the same time, for the employees whose assessment is not ideal, work with the leaders of their departments to formulate a performance improvement plan to ensure the improvement of overall performance.In order to attract more excellent talents, the human resources department has implemented the plan of \"recommending talents with awards\": the human resources department regularly publishes the posts urgently needed by each department and encourages employees to recommend talents outside the company. If the recommended employee passes the application and successfully passes the probation period, the company will give a certain amount of material reward to the recommended employee. The implementation of this measure has greatly improved the enthusiasm of internal employees to recommend talents, ensured the quality of recommended talents, changed the difficult situation of recruiting talents in the past, and solved the talents required for important posts in the company in a short time.At the same time, these HR managers are also an important bridge for communication between the company and"
"the difficult situation of recruiting talents in the past, and solved the talents required for important posts in the company in a short time.At the same time, these HR managers are also an important bridge for communication between the company and ordinary employees: explain and communicate with employees on various policies, rules, and regulations of the company; solve various problems unrelated to business in employees' daily work; and at the same time, report various problems, opinions, and suggestions fed back by employees to leaders at all levels.6. Conclusion(1)Combined with the kernel mean clustering algorithm, this paper proposes a nonconvex relaxation clustering model (pkkm) of the kernel mean clustering model and analyzes the relationship between the model and the orthogonal nonnegative matrix decomposition model, nonnegative spectral clustering, and other models. The proposed algorithm can quickly cluster high-dimensional nonlinear data and has achieved ideal experimental results in experiments.(2)Because human resource management is dynamic, the research results of this paper are based on the problems existing in the human resource management system of H group. Therefore, with the adjustment of H Group's development strategy, the human resource management system should be dynamically adjusted to ensure that the human resource management system can meet the requirements of the group's internal and external environment.(3)After putting forward the optimization"
"strategy, the human resource management system should be dynamically adjusted to ensure that the human resource management system can meet the requirements of the group's internal and external environment.(3)After putting forward the optimization scheme of human resource management system of H group, this paper puts forward the implementation and guarantees measures of the optimization scheme. However, the optimization scheme, implementation scheme, and safeguard measures proposed in this paper need to be tested by the practical work.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Saltos R.andWeber R.,A rough-fuzzy approach for support vector clustering,Information Sciences.

The experimental results show that the time cost of sensor clustering is 1% of hierarchical clustering. In the worst case, the time cost of sensor clustering only accounts for 1/14 of hierarchical clustering.1. IntroductionIn recent years, with the development of electronic technology, the operation mode of social production and public services is developing in the direction of intelligence, leading to the development of society. IoT big data is one of the hot spots in the current IoT industry development. The Internet of Things integrates intelligent perception and recognition technology with ubiquitous computing and ubiquitous networks. It is called the third wave of the Internet of Things in the development of the world's information industry after the computer and the Internet. It mainly uses intelligent sensing, identification, and other technologies and uses network communication transmission technology to communicate things. IoT technology is changing the way of life.With the wide application of Internet of Things technology in enterprise financial risk control information management, higher requirements are put forward for data processing in enterprise financial risk control information management.

"the wide application of Internet of Things technology in enterprise financial risk control information management, higher requirements are put forward for data processing in enterprise financial risk control information management. The traditional enterprise information data processing technology cannot meet the technical requirements. It includes the integration and extraction of enterprise big data based on the Internet of Things, which requires the support of big data technology. After an in-depth investigation of enterprise acquisition systems, analysis systems, and storage systems using the Internet of Things. Although big data processing technology has been applied to most enterprise processing analysis systems, there are still many problems to be solved. For example, how to quickly process and analyze massive redundant data with low data value density, how to quickly remove redundant data for real-time processing in the face of large-scale data flow, and how to optimize the large table equivalent connection in the existing big data computing environment, starting from the data scenarios and data characteristics of practical applications, this paper proposes some optimized processing methods.The innovation of this article is as follows: (1) Through the research in this paper, it is expected to establish an enterprise quality information management system for IoT big data.

Related WorkIn recent years, big data research on the Internet of Things has become a hot spot for scholars, and more and more scholars are collecting data from factories, hospitals, and stores. When Nobre G C researched the circular economy, it found that cutting-edge technologies such as big data and the Internet of Things have the potential to capitalize on organizational and social adoption of the CE concept. It is becoming more and more common in daily life [1]. Ghallab et al. believes that the Internet of Things is the basic concept of a new technology, which has great development prospects and significance in various fields [2].

"development prospects and significance in various fields [2]. Ge et al. conducted a survey of big data technologies in different IoT fields, hoping to facilitate knowledge sharing in the IoT field. He discussed the similarities and differences of big data technologies used in different IoT domains. He suggested that certain big data technologies used in one IoT domain could be reused in another IoT domain. He also developed a conceptual framework outlining the key big data technologies in all the reviewed IoT domains [3]. Babar and Arif believe that the recent growth and expansion in the IoT space offers great business prospects for the direction of the new era of smart cities. The real-time processing of data and intelligent decision-making capabilities pose extensive challenges to the continuous enhancement of multi-faceted urban facilities [4]. Pouryazdan et al. improved the value of crowd-perceived big data by properly motivating users in a mobile crowd-aware system. He found that since data collection is participatory, crowd-aware systems face challenges in data credibility and authenticity assurance. The motivation may be to manipulate perceived data to maximize revenue [5]. Shadroo and Rahmani found that IoT has emerged as a new opportunity in recent years.

"as a new opportunity in recent years. All the electronic devices around us contribute to daily life. Approaches such as big data and data mining can be used to improve the efficiency of IoT and the storage challenges of large data volumes, as well as the transmission, analysis, and processing of data volumes on IoT. The purpose of his research is to investigate research on the Internet of Things using big data and data mining methods to identify topics that must be more emphasized in current and future research paths [6]. Tong and Sun built a real-time image detection and processing platform using the IoT-based Adaboost framework. This enables real-time image transmission and processing based on different databases. His research found that RT-IDPP proposed for IoT enables image detection and tracking. This method can not only run effectively on different cloud platforms but also meet the real-time requirements in the process of image detection and tracking, ensuring that the image detection rate is higher than 97% [7]. However, the shortcoming of these studies is the uncertainty of data quality, and the calculation and analysis of massive data are very complicated. Therefore, these research data still need to be improved.3.

"Methods of IoT Big DataBig data is used to describe any large amount of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data that have the potential to be extracted into information. Big data extracts large amounts of useful data and information from applications. This is very beneficial and can save costs, improve the efficiency of information collection, and improve the ability to innovate [8]. Figure1shows the application of big data integrated with IoT.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.1. Internet of ThingsIoT needs to leverage a range of existing or evolving advanced technologies, such as machine to machine communication (M2M), data mining and decision-making, self-organizing networking, security and privacy protection, cloud computing, and sensing and triggering technologies. In order to connect physical objects and virtual objects with each other to provide better services. Therefore, the reference model of the Internet of Things is briefly summarized [9]. It is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe main part of the IoT reference model can be divided into four layers: application layer, business/application support layer, network layer, and device layer. In addition, it also includes cross-layer management capabilities and security capabilities [10].

"capabilities and security capabilities [10]. Among them, the application layer refers to the various Internet of Things applications that users can finally see. The business/application support layer includes general support capabilities and special support capabilities. The general support capability corresponds to the public network support capability, while the special support capability corresponds to the industry private network support capability. The network layer includes networking capability and transmission capability. Networking capabilities can provide control functions related to network connectivity. The transmission capability provides links for IOT services/applications, as well as control and management information for data transmission. Equipment layer capabilities can be logically divided into terminal capabilities, gateway capabilities, and end node capabilities. The terminal refers to the entity directly communicating with the information communication network. The end node refers to the entity that communicates with the information communication network through the gateway.The Internet of Things is a new mode of communication where objects in the virtual extended world and the physical world are interconnected.

"interconnected. It runs a plethora of applications and services and then develops it while having to overcome enormous challenges to make IoT a reality. IoT involves different knowledge domains such as ubiquitous computing, network communication, object recognition, and special data processing [11]. In this context, outliers detected by big data processing are used to select and implement the IOT architecture.3.2. Big Data Algorithms3.2.1. Clustering AlgorithmThe ability of classical clustering algorithms to deal with big data is limited. In the face of large-scale and high-complexity datasets, using them directly is inefficient or even ineffective. At present, in the era of big data, the problem of clustering large-scale data needs to be solved urgently. At present, in order to improve the scalability and practicability of clustering algorithms, people have proposed several novel clustering ideas to solve the problem of big data clustering based on the reasons for the failure of traditional clustering algorithms [12]. The first is parallel processing, the second is data compression, and the third is data sampling. These three clustering ideas alleviate the clustering problem of large datasets to a great extent. Table1summarizes the time and space complexity of classical traditional clustering algorithms.1.Time and space complexity of traditional clustering algorithms.Clustering algorithmComplexityTimeSpaceK-meansO(nKt)O(K)K-medianO(n2t)O(n)PAMO(K(n−K)2)O(K)Single"

However, in practical application, the algorithm is very sensitive to the selection of initial clustering centers. It also contains NP-hard problems and is not suitable when dealing with large-scale data. The time complexity of the remaining algorithms is nonlinear with N. With the increase of data size, the time complexity will increase more obviously. This not only reduces the quality of the clustering algorithm but also far exceeds the running time of traditional clustering algorithms. Therefore, none of them can directly handle large-scale datasets [13]. Figure3is a common big data clustering algorithm. Representative algorithms include cure algorithm, clara/clarans algorithm, and birch algorithm.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.2.2.

It is based on the moment of similarity of data. The core step of the AP algorithm is the iterative update of representativeness and fitness.(1) Algorithm analysis. Its formula is as follows:(1)Then, for any pointXi, its class representative point isXk, where(2)The AP algorithm is initialized toA(n,s) = 0, that is, each point is equally likely to be represented by other points and to represent other points.(2) Comparative Experiment of CBAP and AP Algorithms. For the dataset Data Sets A whose size does not exceed 4500, the CBAP algorithm and the AP algorithm are used for clustering, respectively. Figure4shows a comparison of the corresponding time curves and therindex.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIt can be seen from the comparison between CBAP and AP1 that the CBAP algorithm greatly shortens the natural logarithm of the clustering time represented by the ordinate in the clustering time.

"seen from the comparison between CBAP and AP1 that the CBAP algorithm greatly shortens the natural logarithm of the clustering time represented by the ordinate in the clustering time. When the size of the dataset reaches more than 3000, the time of the AP algorithm is dozens of times that of the CBAP algorithm. According to AP2, the clustering results of CBAP and AP are basically the same (the r index is about 0.97). Therefore, it does not reduce the clustering quality of the original AP algorithm [14].Based on the good clustering results for artificial datasets, we will continue to apply the CBAP algorithm to cluster some real datasets. Table2lists the corresponding A index, B value,Rindex, and clustering time of the two methods under different real datasets (300 core points are taken in the experiment [15].2.Comparison of the performance of CBAP and AP on real datasets.DatasetA-indexB-valueTimeR-indexAPCBAPAPCBAPAPCABAPLetter {f,i,g}0.7210.8130.8430.90939.482.410.922Letter {r,s,t}0.4720.6660.6180.94139.782.730.521Usps {0, 6, 9}0.7110.7220.8280.98673.0617.320.842Usps {3, 4, 5}0.6550.7250.8770.95634.5210.780.836As can be seen from Table2, compared with the AP algorithm, the CBAP algorithm not only greatly reduces the clustering time but also the A index and B value are significantly better than the original algorithm.

"time but also the A index and B value are significantly better than the original algorithm. This is because the selection of core points reduces the proportion of noise points or abnormal data, thereby improving the clustering performance of the AP algorithm on the core set. Therefore, after the clustering results of the core set are mapped to the large dataset, the clustering quality of the large dataset is also improved. This further proves the effectiveness of the CBAP algorithm for clustering big data. If the data points are within the upper and lower limits of the control chart and the arrangement and distribution do not show chain, tendency, periodic characteristics, etc., it can be determined that the process quality is under control. On the contrary, it is necessary to explore the causes and propose solutions.3.3. Control Chart MethodThe control chart method is the main method used in the statistical process control subsystem module. It can determine that the process quality is at a normal level and plays a role in preventing defective products. The process quality is affected by various factors and exhibits random fluctuations and abnormal fluctuations. The smaller the fluctuation range, the more stable the process quality, and vice versa [16].The calculation principle of the three control lines of the control chart (taking the mean value control chart as an example) is as follows:(3)whereis the center line of the control chart,is the upper control line of the"

Among them, the expected value ofxis(4)The expected value of standard deviation is(5)μandσare calculated from the sample data size to get, so(6)In the formula,andare the mean values of the sample ranges, andD2is obtained from the standard [\"Conventional Control Chart\" (GB/T4091-2001)] query.3.4. Dependency-Based Sensor Clustering3.4.1. Definition of DependenciesSensor similarity (SensorSimilarity): LetDand K be two sensor sets, andTAandTBbe two object sets detected by A and B, respectively; then the sensor similarity of A and B is defined as the intersection ofTAandTB[17].(7)The calculation method of sensor similarity can facilitate 1 and 2, but this is a time-consuming process. Therefore, a more efficient calculation method of sensor similarity is proposed, which can greatly reduce the computational time overhead of sensor similarity. The calculation formula of sensor similarity is expressed as follows:(8)whereJaccard(TA,TB) represents the Jaccard coefficient betweenTAandTB, that is,(9)In physical object retrieval, if the access to one sensorDdata file will inevitably lead to another sensor K data file access, then we say that sensor A depends on sensor B [18].It"
"represents the Jaccard coefficient betweenTAandTB, that is,(9)In physical object retrieval, if the access to one sensorDdata file will inevitably lead to another sensor K data file access, then we say that sensor A depends on sensor B [18].It assumes that there are sensor dependencies ofD⟶KandK⟶Lin the sensor set, and according to the transitive relationship of the dependencies,D⟶Lcan be inferred. The most important operation in the dependency graph is the initialization of the dependency graph. According to the above formula, S6 and S1 have higher sensor similarity than S8. Therefore, in the clustering process, node S6 will always cluster before S8 and S1. Therefore, as shown in Figure5(b), we do not need to maintain the dependency between S6 and S8. The initialization algorithm of the dependency graph is shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint3.4.2.

Therefore, the dependent edge connected to the leaf node can be deleted directly. It loops the above steps until the number of clusters reaches the lower limit of the number of clusters.

"to the leaf node can be deleted directly. It loops the above steps until the number of clusters reaches the lower limit of the number of clusters. The remaining nodes in the dependency graph represent clusters after clustering, and the merged point set in each node is the sensor set represented by the cluster [19].The time cost comparison between sensor clustering and hierarchical clustering is shown in Figure6. The time cost of the clustering process here is obtained by calculating the average time statistics. In the best case, the time overhead of sensor clustering is 1% of that of hierarchical clustering. In the worst case, the time cost of sensor clustering is only 1/14 of that of hierarchical clustering. The experimental results show that the spatial cost of sensor clustering is reduced by 14 times, 20 times, 40 times, 50 times, and 23 times, respectively, compared with hierarchical clustering. Sensor clustering has obvious time overhead and memory overhead advantages [20].Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint4.

The main functions of the design of enterprise financial management information system are as follows: First, the system can clearly show the flow direction of cash flow; second, the system needs to be able to display the information of financial assets and fixed assets of the enterprise and can analyze and compare them; third, by using this system, the enterprise financial management personnel and accounting personnel can realize the analysis and calculation of various data in the financial system; fourth, the enterprise financial management information system can provide the decision-makers with the basis they need; fifth, with this system, the operation efficiency and financial management efficiency of the enterprise can be greatly improved.Software to achieve quality management business must implement the whole process of quality management functions and coordinate the relationship between them.

It involves the entire product life cycle, including product design and development, process confirmation, manufacturing, storage, transportation, and delivery, as well as subsequent customer experience, feedback, and evaluation services. In order to improve the market competitiveness of enterprises and explore their own and product improvement goals, competitor benchmarking information management is added to the model. The software model shows that the whole system is an open system closely related to the external environment [21]. In addition, the four-stage quality management tasks of quality planning, quality control, quality assurance, and quality improvement in the model form a closed-loop loop with the business process. This clearly demonstrates the quality improvement idea of PDCA cycle.4.1.

DiscussionThe modern era is an information age, and big data is the key word of this era. Through the integration of big data and the Internet of Things, human society has reached an unprecedented level of intelligence. This brings unprecedented convenience to people's production and life. This is the trend of the times and has broad prospects. Massive IoT sensors generate a large amount of sensory data every day, so IoT is considered to be one of the most important big data sources in the future.With the improvement of modern enterprise financial management requirements, computer technology has also been more applied to enterprise financial management and has had a great impact on all aspects of the enterprise, such as accounting methods and processes, job division in the financial department, storage forms of accounting information and data, etc. It has changed the traditional financial"

In view of this, this paper makes a detailed analysis and research on the enterprise financial risk control information management system. Based on the theory of enterprise financial risk, this paper analyzes the business process, related technology, and system architecture of the enterprise quality management information system. It can be predicted that with the passage of time, the application of the Internet of Things will promote the further development of the data space and form a huge Internet of Things big data. Therefore, the big data of the Internet of Things is of great significance to the design and implementation of the enterprise financial risk control information management system.This paper mainly introduces the concepts of big data and the Internet of Things, as well as big data clustering algorithms.

When big data is integrated into the Internet of Things, it is bound to improve the intelligence of human production and life. Its application can involve almost all aspects, such as the medical and health industry, network enterprises, advertising and marketing industry, financial services industry, and so on. Therefore, a good grasp of the big data of the Internet of Things is indispensable for the future realization of the enterprise financial risk control information management system.6. ConclusionsThe financial department of an enterprise is a comprehensive economic information management department. An important component of the big data design enterprise financial risk control information management system is the financial information management system, which is not only a centralized reflection of the enterprise's business status but also the most direct means to supervise the implementation of the national financial system.

"it has driven the rapid attack of the information industry. The amount of data is growing explosively, and the data structure is becoming more and more complex. Financial informatization means that financial personnel improve the business process of enterprise management through modern technical means and build a supporting enterprise financial management mechanism to fully tap the information potential of the enterprise's financial resources, so as to ensure that the enterprise's information resources can be fully utilized, promote the overall financial management level and efficiency of the enterprise, and ensure the efficient and low-cost development of various business activities of the enterprise. It will help enterprises better achieve their financial goals and even the overall strategic goals. Based on the characteristics of manufacturing quality management and the laws of product formation, this paper applies Internet of Things big data to research and develop the enterprise financial risk control information management system, realizes the networked management of product quality, standardizes the business process of enterprise quality management, and enables enterprises to establish a perfect quality system.

"the concepts of the Internet of Things and big data, the enterprise quality management system model is established by using the clustering algorithm, control chart method, and sensor clustering of dependency. The business process of enterprise quality management is sorted out, and the system applies integration testing on the business logic structure. Due to the increasingly complex production mode of manufacturing enterprises, the number of quality related parties is gradually increasing. Therefore, the research content of this paper needs to continue to think and explore, and the enterprise financial risk control information management system should be further refined and improved. If an enterprise wants to be in an invincible position in such a competitive environment, it must grasp the financial information timely and accurately, correctly analyze the development prospect of the enterprise, and make reasonable scheme decisions in time. In today's information age, only with modern management methods can we reflect the business status and operation of an enterprise faster, better, more truly and effectively. In today's complex and rapidly changing market, only computers can quickly, objectively, comprehensively, and accurately make detailed data analysis.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis research was financially supported by the Special Project of the Normal University important fields of Guangdong province"

"AbstractWith the continuous development of information technology, conventional physical education teaching methods are no longer applicable. In order to ensure the objectivity of college physical education evaluation, this paper designs a set of college physical education management information system based on artificial intelligence technology. The weighting algorithm in the student performance evaluation module and teacher performance evaluation module in the system adopts the intelligent algorithm based on FNN neural network. Experimental verification shows that the intelligent algorithm based on the FNN neural network can effectively predict the students' score in the national college physical education examination, which can provide a more objective basis for teacher performance evaluation.1. IntroductionWang Yuqing said in the study that physical education in colleges and universities in China is divided into physical education major, physical education major, and nonphysical education major [1]. Wang Ming said in the study which professional terms such as sports management and competition management are nonphysical education majors [2]. Li Feifei said that, according to the requirements of the Ministry of Education, nonsports majors need to receive at least 2 hours of formal physical education every week [3]. Wen Jiao said in a study on college physical education that the premise for students to obtain graduation qualification is that their physical performance passes"
"majors need to receive at least 2 hours of formal physical education every week [3]. Wen Jiao said in a study on college physical education that the premise for students to obtain graduation qualification is that their physical performance passes the national unified physical education examination [4]. Li Zhang has proposed the university sports test content in the study. The test contents include middle and long distance running (1500m for boys and 800m for girls), standing long jump or high jump, throwing (shot put, rubber ball, and long handle grenade throw are optional), physical flexibility (generally sitting forward flexion), and learning a competition [5]. LiuYanRu also further explained to the college sports test that, in addition to competition events, running, jumping, throwing, flexibility, and other tests all pass the score line strictly [6]. Zhang Jianye explains the other events in the college sports tests: competition events can generally be selected from badminton, tennis, table tennis, basketball, volleyball and other ball games, or martial arts [7].Li Zihao carried out research on the effectiveness of physical education teaching in universities. In the early research, students' physical education achievements were only constrained by the unified examination of national college physical education curriculum, so too many examination oriented elements were integrated into physical education [8].

"were only constrained by the unified examination of national college physical education curriculum, so too many examination oriented elements were integrated into physical education [8]. The study believes that the core goal of college physical education should be to improve students' comprehensive physical quality and ensure students' physical and mental health during their study in school. Li Xianshu considers that students' physical and mental health is difficult to be effectively controlled by the traditional index factor method [9], so artificial intelligence algorithm is introduced to construct fuzzy evaluation factors for students' physical and mental health, so as to evaluate the achievements of physical education in colleges and universities.Fuzzy factor method uses fuzzy neural network (FNN) to analyze multiple controllable indexes of students. Gaobin illustrates the FNN, indicating that FNN is a double variable that presses the data into a [0,1] interval [10] and uses this variable to control the teaching results of physical education teachers.2. Comprehensive Evaluation Model of College Students' Physical Education AchievementsYang Dapeng in his study proposed that, in the actual management of college students, students' physical fitness test and physical education examination can directly reflect students' physical education curriculum level [11]. YongBai (2016) stated in the study that, in addition, students' vital capacity, body fat rate, and other indicators"
"students' physical fitness test and physical education examination can directly reflect students' physical education curriculum level [11]. YongBai (2016) stated in the study that, in addition, students' vital capacity, body fat rate, and other indicators were investigated by general surgical examination in students' regular physical examination and students' SAS and SDS level in general psychiatric examination can reflect students' physical and mental health from a certain angle [12]. The logical relationship between the above four categories of data and related subcategories is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointEvaluation index of physical education in colleges and universities and its machine learning analysis.In Figure1, the general surgical examination data and physical examination data in physical examination belong to dimensional data, which can be recognized by FNN only after dimensionless normalization. Other data belong to dimensionless data and can be directly input into FNN. The fuzzy convolution result of FNN can be directly used as the fuzzy evaluation result of students' physical education achievement. The results of the above dimensionless normalization algorithm is shown (1) as(1)wherexiis theiinput value inxsequence,yiis the dimensionless output value corresponding to theiinput value in sequencex, min(x) is the minimum value of sequencex, and max(x) is the maximum value of sequencex.The data sorted by the above minmax module are all"
"theiinput value inxsequence,yiis the dimensionless output value corresponding to theiinput value in sequencex, min(x) is the minimum value of sequencex, and max(x) is the maximum value of sequencex.The data sorted by the above minmax module are all data in the [0,1] interval, while mental health data such as SDS and SAS and physical examination result data are dimensionless data. If there are no special requirements, SDS and SAS will count in the [0,10] interval according to the 10 point system, and the physical examination results will count in the [0100] interval according to the 100 point system. In order to reduce the complexity of the statistical process of this module, when it is required to issue SDS and SAS evaluation, directly input the 1-point system results; that is, the original results are formed in the [0,1] interval, and the physical examination results are also directly issued in the 1-point system results; that is, the original results are formed in the [0,1] interval.The statistical significance of FNN neural network is to summarize all the above input data into a double precision data as the actual evaluation result data of students. If there is no subsequent data processing, FNN neural network will be trained to converge to a double precision variable in the [0,1] interval. This variable is multiplied by 100 to form a 100 point evaluation result as the final physical education achievement of students. The node function of the neural network selects"
"be trained to converge to a double precision variable in the [0,1] interval. This variable is multiplied by 100 to form a 100 point evaluation result as the final physical education achievement of students. The node function of the neural network selects polynomial depth iterative regression function (2):(2)wherenis the number of nodes of the previous neural network,jis the polynomial order, andAjis the coefficient to be regressed of thejorder polynomial. Other mathematical symbols have the same meaning as (1).3. Construction of Artificial Intelligence System for College Physical EducationBased on the comprehensive analysis of the above neural network model, it is found that, in addition to the system administrator, the system needs four roles, namely, the assessed students, physical education teachers, surgeons, and psychologists. Surgeons fill in the results of general surgical examinations, psychologists fill in the results of SAS and SDS scales, and physical education teachers fill in the results of the national unified physical education examination and physical fitness test in colleges and universities. In addition to cooperating with the above four inspections, students have the authority to query the transcripts. The transcripts will also be submitted to the Academic Affairs Office for teaching quality evaluation and to the student work office for student performance summary management. The system architecture is shown in Figure2:Figure 2Open in figure"
"The transcripts will also be submitted to the Academic Affairs Office for teaching quality evaluation and to the student work office for student performance summary management. The system architecture is shown in Figure2:Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointArchitecture diagram of the artificial intelligence system (FNN) for physical education teaching evaluation in colleges and universities.In Figure2, FNN neural network and predata processing process have been deeply analyzed in the previous text. Here, we focus on the postprocessing of students' transcripts. The system provides the general query function of students' transcripts; that is, entering the student number can query the transcripts of the specified students, and entering the class name can access the summary table of the transcripts of the whole class, including the descending sorting of scores, and the classified statistics of excellent (80-100 points), pass (60-80 points), and fail (0-60 points). At the same time, teachers' postperformance is evaluated according to the change and distribution of students' performance. Because other statistical work algorithms are relatively simple and limited by space, they are not discussed here. Only the teacher postperformance evaluation algorithm is expanded as Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the teacher performance evaluation system.In Figure3, another group of FNN neural networks is used to evaluate teacher performance.

"evaluation algorithm is expanded as Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the teacher performance evaluation system.In Figure3, another group of FNN neural networks is used to evaluate teacher performance. The node function of the neural network is consistent with that of the FNN network in Figure2. Refer to (2), and the data preprocessing algorithm before the neural network refers to (1). If the traditional teacher performance evaluation scheme based on the weighted factor method is adopted, because the weighted factor itself has a systematic error and the systematic error may be aimed at different students' basic physical conditions, differences in colleges and departments, differences in students' gender and age, etc., the evaluation reliability cannot be effectively guaranteed. In this study, FNN neural network is selected for the comprehensive evaluation of students' physical education performance, and it also realizes the comprehensive evaluation of teachers' performance.4. Overall Simulation Verification of System EffectivenessTaking the real original files of 21 nonsports majors in 2018 and 2019 in 2020-2021 academic year as the data source, the analysis environment is constructed in MATLAB, the traditional method is used to analyze student performance and teacher performance as the reference group, and the artificial intelligence method designed in this study is used to analyze student performance and teacher performance as the"
"in MATLAB, the traditional method is used to analyze student performance and teacher performance as the reference group, and the artificial intelligence method designed in this study is used to analyze student performance and teacher performance as the observation group. The following three validation studies were carried out.4.1. Correlation between Artificial Intelligence Evaluation and National Physical Education Examination ResultsIn order to verify the role of the artificial intelligence method designed in this study in student achievement and teacher achievement, the R2 value was obtained by the linear regression method under SPSS, andtvalue andPvalue were obtained by bivariatetcalibration.The R2 values were counted as the ratio of the regression residue to the mean residue (3):(3)whereis the mean value of the test sample sequence,xiis the regression value in the sequence,iis the input value in the sequence, andnis the number of test samples.TheTvalue andPvalue of bivariate t-check come from the bivariate t-check process, wheretvalue is the value value of the output result. Whent> 10.000, it is considered that there is a statistical difference between the two columns of data, and the greater theTvalue, the greater the statistical difference; thePvalue is the log value of the output result. Whenp< 0.05, it is considered that the result data are within the confidence space. Whenp< 0.01, it is considered that the result data have a significant statistical significance."
"statistical difference; thePvalue is the log value of the output result. Whenp< 0.05, it is considered that the result data are within the confidence space. Whenp< 0.01, it is considered that the result data have a significant statistical significance. The smaller thepvalue, the higher the degree of confidence. Subject to the length, only the calculation algorithm ofTvalue (value) is explained here (4):(4)where x means the average value of the investigation sample sequence andμmeans the average value of the reference sequence.nis the number of nodes of the investigation sample sequence, m is the number of nodes of the reference sample sequence, andσmeans the standard deviation rate of the investigation sample sequence. Firstly, the linear regression method is used to calculate the correlation between the national unified examination results and the comprehensive evaluation results of the system, and Figure4is obtained.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointLinear regression results of national unified examination results and comprehensive evaluation results of the system.In Figure4, there is a significant linear relationship between the results of the National Physical Education unified examination and the comprehensive evaluation value of the system,R2= 0.9509 andP= 0.003, because the comprehensive evaluation process of the system does not introduce the results of the National Physical Education unified examination, but according to the results of the physical education"
"evaluation value of the system,R2= 0.9509 andP= 0.003, because the comprehensive evaluation process of the system does not introduce the results of the National Physical Education unified examination, but according to the results of the physical education classroom teaching test, it can be considered that the system has a certain predictive value for the results of the National Physical Education unified examination. TheR2value calculation scheme is the ratio of regression variance to linear variance, which can calculate the difference between the regression result and the original result.In the actual correlation analysis, in addition to the results of the National Physical Education unified examination, it also investigates the results of SDS and SAS evaluation, comprehensive physical examination evaluation, and surgical examination evaluation of students in the evaluation of students' mental health and introduces the bivariatet-test analysis results of the above evaluation results and the comprehensive evaluation results of artificial intelligence given by the system.

However, there are some statistical differences between the relevant data. For example, the comprehensive evaluation results of artificial intelligence given by the system are highly correlated with the results of the national physical examination, physical fitness test, and general surgical examination (bothTvalue and R2 value are large), but slightly less correlated with the results of mental health examination (SAS and SDS) (bothTvalue and R2 value are small).In Figure5, the correlation between the national unified assessment results and the comprehensive evaluation of the artificial intelligence system is calculated by the linear regression method to compare the differences between the original assessment items and artificial intelligence system.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointCorrelation between student assessment items and comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence.4.2.

After Using the Artificial Intelligence Comprehensive Evaluation System, the Statistical Results of Teachers' Performance ChangeThere are 24 PE teachers in our school. The evaluation results of the original teaching evaluation teachers' performance are counted, and then, the artificial intelligence teacher performance evaluation method given by the system is used to evaluate the teachers' performance.

Among the four teachers who obtain advanced teachers in the new scheme, three teachers are different from the previous evaluation result list, accounting for 75%, while the probability of backward teachers increases from 21% to 33%, and one teacher is different from the previous evaluation result list, accounting for 18%.

"increases from 21% to 33%, and one teacher is different from the previous evaluation result list, accounting for 18%. That is, the new scheme has more stringent requirements for teachers and puts forward higher requirements for college physical education teachers.In Figure6, through the analysis of the correlation between the old and new schemes on teachers' performance evaluation results and using the artificial intelligence teachers' performance evaluation method given by the system to evaluate teachers' performance, it is found that the probability of obtaining senior teachers has decreased by 8%, the performance evaluation of teachers is more strict, and the probability of teachers with poor evaluation is higher, and it is concluded that the new scheme has higher requirements for PE teachers and the judgment results are more rigorous.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointCorrelation between old and new schemes and teachers' performance evaluation results.4.3. Investigation and Statistics of Teachers' and Students' Subjective Feelings about the Evaluation Results of the SystemBecause the above simulation process is aimed at the student performance and teacher performance in the academic year 2020-2021, 500 students are selected as the survey object, and all 24 teachers are selected as the survey object.

They are required to \"support,\" \"no objection,\" and \"oppose\" the change of the evaluation system by displaying the previous evaluation results and the evaluation results given by the new system; the statistics of three evaluation results are shown in Table3:Table  3.Statistics of support rate for the new system among students and teachers.Comparison itemsStudentn= 500Teachern= 24SupportNo objOpposeSupportNo objOpposePrevious method149 (29.8)60 (12)291 (58.2)6 (25)3 (12.5)15 (62.5)New method396 (79.2)45 (9)59 (11.8)9 (37.5)5 (20.8)10 (41.7)In Table3, although the evaluation of teachers in the new system is more harsh, the support rate of teachers for the new system has increased from 25.0% to 37.5% and the opposition rate has decreased from 62.5% to 41.7% compared with the previous system. The fundamental reason is that the evaluation criteria for teachers in the new system are more comprehensive and objective, and teachers can perform more actively in their work, the ratio of labor pay to labor return is more significant. Students' evaluation results of the new system are much higher than those of the previous system, in which the support rate has increased from 29.8% to 79.2%, and the opposition rate has decreased from 58.2% to 11.8%.In Figure7, through the analysis of the correlation between the new scheme and the support rate of teachers, the evaluation standard of the new scheme is more"

SummaryIn the college physical education management information system, the artificial intelligence evaluation method is used to replace the previous weighted index evaluation method so that the data displayed in the conventional teaching link can intuitively predict the National Physical Education unified examination results, and the evaluation of students' performance and teachers' performance are more objective and comprehensive.

"AbstractIn order to better deal with the challenges brought by the changes of the external environment to the ideological and political work of college students and better solve the problems of dogma, lack of operability, and inability to adapt to the changes of the new situation and environment, this topic proposes a student management information system based on the artificial neural network. This method strengthens the construction of the student management system, deeply interprets the connotation and practical needs of ideological and political work in colleges and universities in the new environment under the background of the \"Internet+\" era, and is committed to further optimizing the strategy of student ideological and political work on the basis of following the principles of innovation, human nature, openness, and ecology of ideological and political work. The results show that the construction of a more scientific student teaching management information system can provide intelligent and digital technical support for the improvement of ideological and political work efficiency and teaching quality and promote the innovative development of ideological and political work in colleges and universities.

"and political work in colleges and universities should gradually overcome preaching, build new methods to measure students' achievements and ideological and political arms, actively occupy the dominant power of Internet discourse, and avoid the negative impact of the network by spreading positive energy.1. IntroductionTraditional university management is often in the form of meetings, documents, and other forms, which consume a lot of human and material resources. Management via Internet has improved efficiency, and compared to offline management, management via Internet is more energy-efficient and carbon-reducing, which plays a meaningful role in environmental protection.The 2019 National Conference on Beliefs and Work Practices in Colleges and Universities made it clear that the principles of ethics and advocacy should be adhered to, and people should be regarded important in an environment for ideological and political work, ideological work and politics in colleges and universities, understand the teaching standards of colleges and universities to the greatest extent, understand the whole process of education for all, and cultivate community skills [1]. Many colleges and universities in China have been playing an important role in cultivating producers and graduates who develop relationships in moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, social, and other aspects. Therefore, vocational training in colleges and universities must adhere to the correct culture [2]. Colleges"
"role in cultivating producers and graduates who develop relationships in moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, social, and other aspects. Therefore, vocational training in colleges and universities must adhere to the correct culture [2]. Colleges and universities have always been an important foundation for growing crops and providing skills for national development and prosperity. Qualified persons with high quality not only must first know the necessary qualifications and theoretical knowledge but also have a higher level of political knowledge. Therefore, in the era of \"Internet+,\" the ideological and political work of colleges and universities must pay attention to the political commitment of students. Based on this principle, we must conscientiously adhere to the educational concept of keeping pace with time, and through the process of innovative design and efficient operation, strengthen the function of theoretical and political principles and good teaching level, as shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2. Literature ReviewLi and others believe that management is a universal social practice of mankind and was first formed in the West as a systematic and independent scientific theory. The history of Western governance has been marked by three developments: the administration in the 19th and 20th centuries, the ideological behavior in the 1920s and 1930s, and modern management since the middle of the 20th century [3].

"Western governance has been marked by three developments: the administration in the 19th and 20th centuries, the ideological behavior in the 1920s and 1930s, and modern management since the middle of the 20th century [3]. Yuan and others said that these management theories are universal and have laid a management foundation for foreign academic circles to study issues related to the management of ideological and political education in colleges and universities [4]. Lee and others believe that ideological and political education in different countries has its own particularity due to their different national conditions and has its unique theoretical basis and language expression. Most of them use the terms of \"civic education,\" \"democratic education,\" \"religious education,\" and \"political socialization\" as the expression of ideological and political education or ideological and moral education [5]. Sreelatha and others have argued that in order to achieve the goal of education and morality, however, governance is necessary. As a result, exploring its management in the study of thought and behavior in colleges and universities has become a recollection and awareness of the behavior of scientists [6]. Huang's and other theoretical studies of ideological discipline management and ethics in colleges and universities, mainly based on academic management and behavior, maintain ethics and govern staff in colleges and universities [7].

"studies of ideological discipline management and ethics in colleges and universities, mainly based on academic management and behavior, maintain ethics and govern staff in colleges and universities [7]. Li and others systematically expounded six management models, namely, the formal model, college model, political model, subjective model, fuzzy model, and cultural model [8]. Among them, the formal model emphasizes that colleges and universities are hierarchical systems, which should reasonably reflect the authority of managers in the organization; the college model is based on democratic principles and forms the common values of the organization through the professional authority of teachers; the political model focuses on the group activities in the organization and emphasizes the unity of individuals, groups, and organizations; Chu and others said that the subjective model emphasizes the belief and understanding of individual members in the organization and pays more attention to the realization of individual goals; the fuzzy model mainly aims at the complex and unstable situation in the organization so as to deepen the individual's understanding of the organization; the cultural model emphasizes that the individual's way of thinking and behavior and belief and value system are the core of organizational culture. The interaction between individuals or groups can promote the formation of organizational norms [9]. Turner and others said that the above six theoretical models"
"of thinking and behavior and belief and value system are the core of organizational culture. The interaction between individuals or groups can promote the formation of organizational norms [9]. Turner and others said that the above six theoretical models comprehensively reflect the in-depth exploration of relevant theories by foreign scholars on the basis of criticism and development and provide a new research paradigm for exploring the management model of ideological and moral education in colleges and universities [10]. Judging by the results of research by Wang Ping and others on this issue, the problems that exist in the management culture and politics in the colleges and universities generally include the following five factors. First, the business management strategy lags behind [11]. Verma and others believe that at present, colleges and universities adopt the traditional administrative command management concept, which is lack of innovation, adhering to the concept of \"social standard\" in management and ignoring the subjective needs of students and lacking humanism. Second, the management content is old. In terms of target management, it is pointed out that the content of target management is lack of pertinence, the planning of target management is lack of integrity, the formulation of objectives is lack of interaction, the implementation of target management is lack of flexibility, and the subjectivity of target management is lack of logic. In terms of"
"the planning of target management is lack of integrity, the formulation of objectives is lack of interaction, the implementation of target management is lack of flexibility, and the subjectivity of target management is lack of logic. In terms of decision-making management, it is considered that the goal orientation of its strategic decision-making is general and lacks quantitative standards. The plan focuses on the completion of short-term tasks and lacks long-term effectiveness. The investigation and decision-making system is not standardized. The information source of work decision-making focuses on the inside, the information analysis and processing is simple and rough, and the decision feedback is lack of summary and correction. Third, the management method is backward [12]. Chen et al. believe that the current problems in the management methods of college students' ideological and political education are mainly manifested in the emphasis on administrative methods, the neglect of micromanagement, the lack of practical activities, and the lack of psychological education. Fourth, the weakness of the management team points out that the construction of the management team is still lack of overall scientific planning, the overall combat capability is not coordinated with the carrying tasks, and the overall quality and positive image need to be improved. Fifth, the management mechanism needs to be improved such as lack of scientific operation mechanism. The cultivation"
"the overall combat capability is not coordinated with the carrying tasks, and the overall quality and positive image need to be improved. Fifth, the management mechanism needs to be improved such as lack of scientific operation mechanism. The cultivation mechanism and guarantee mechanism of management team are not perfect. The internal communication and coordination mechanism, information mechanism, and evaluation mechanism of the management system are imperfect [13].3. Student Management Information System Based on the Artificial Neural Network3.1. Global Evolutionary Neural Network3.1.1. General Framework of the EPNN Evolutionary Learning SystemThe evolutionary learning system of the neural network consists of three interrelated parts, that is, connection right evolution learning mechanism, structure evolution mechanism, and learning rule evolution mechanism. Each part of the learning system has its dependent environment and corresponding evaluation mechanism [14]. Figure2shows a general block diagram of an evolutionary system.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.1.2. Description of the EPNN Evolutionary Learning AlgorithmConsidering the interconnection of multiple layers on the front network, assume thatXandYrepresent the input and output vectors of the network, respectively, yi represent the actual output of the network, andm,N, andnrepresent the number of devices accessing the network, hidden units, and output units, respectively, I/O correlation between the entry process,"
"and output vectors of the network, respectively, yi represent the actual output of the network, andm,N, andnrepresent the number of devices accessing the network, hidden units, and output units, respectively, I/O correlation between the entry process, hidden layer, and release process can be shown as(1)The above two formulas meet 1 ≤j≤m:(2)wherem<i≤m+N,(3)wherem+N<i≤m+N+n.In the above formula,Wi, jrepresents the offset or threshold of theithprocessing unit, and then, there is the following formula(4)In the above formula,Trepresents an adjustable parameter, which is used to adjust the shape of S-type action function.For all connections to the forward network, it is assumed thatmandnrepresent the number of devices and outputs of the network, respectively, andNrepresents the hidden numbers. The structure and weight of the network are equal to one person through direct access [15]. The length of each individual is the same, and the number of hidden units contained in the corresponding neural network can be the same or different. This is determined by the stateSof each hidden unit in the individual representation.The fitness of individuals is determined by the connection weight, learning performance, and structural performance of evolutionary networks, expressed as follows:(5)whererepresents the structural performance index of theithindividual andrepresents the connection weight learning performance index of theithindividual.In the study, the network and variance are used as the"
"evolutionary networks, expressed as follows:(5)whererepresents the structural performance index of theithindividual andrepresents the connection weight learning performance index of theithindividual.In the study, the network and variance are used as the learning performance evaluation of connection weight and the network structure complexity index--the number of hidden units and the number of effective connections are used as the structural evaluation--so as to determine the individual fitness [16], expressed as follows:(6)League selection is a common strategy in the research of evolutionary optimization function based on EP. In order to ensure the structural diversity in the process of evolution, in the connection weight evolutionary learning, multitrack evolutionary selection is adopted, that is, the new individual generated by mutation only competes with its parent individual, and the one with better performance can survive [17].In structural evolution learning, the selection rules are as follows. When the fitness performance is equal, individuals with the small structure scale are preferred; for the hidden unit addition variation, only when the structural variation improves the learning performance of weight evolution and can the new individual with better performance replace the individual with the worst performance of its parent, which indicates structural evolution; and for hidden unit deletion variation, only when the structural variation does not reduce the learning"
"can the new individual with better performance replace the individual with the worst performance of its parent, which indicates structural evolution; and for hidden unit deletion variation, only when the structural variation does not reduce the learning performance of weight evolution, and the new individual with better performance will replace the individual with the worst performance of its parent, which indicates structural evolution [18].In the structural variation, when the hidden unit is added and mutated, the relevant connection weight of the newly added hidden unit is set to zero, and the relevant connection weight of the original hidden unit remains unchanged. When the hidden unit is deleted and mutated, the relevant connection weight of the original hidden unit remains unchanged. The purpose of this is to expect good performance changes between father and son generations before and after structural variation, and the generation gap should be as small as possible [19].In EPNNA, first, evolutionary learning is carried out for the fully connected forward network, and finally, the learned network is pruned. Structural variation includes three basic operators: hidden unit addition variation, hidden unit deletion variation, and connection pruning variation.(1) Implicit unit addition variation: after variation, the number ofithindividual hidden units in the population is(7)where Δmaxrepresents the maximum number of hidden units allowed to be added or deleted per"
"variation, and connection pruning variation.(1) Implicit unit addition variation: after variation, the number ofithindividual hidden units in the population is(7)where Δmaxrepresents the maximum number of hidden units allowed to be added or deleted per structural variation, andU[1, Δmax] represents the uniformly distributed random number between 1 and Δmax.(2) Hidden unit deletion variation: after variation, the number ofithindividual hidden units in the population is(8)Randomly selecthidden units from the individual hidden unit queue and delete their related connections in the individual network.3.2. Connection Pruning VariationFor the individual network with a satisfactory fitness value, the connection pruning variation is determined according to the number of connections whose connection weight tends to. In the prunable case, each mutation deletes one of the least important connections from the network [20].When and only when the population evolution stagnates or a satisfactory solution is obtained, the connection weight learning is ended and the process of structural evolution learning is transferred. In the process of structural evolution learning, different structural variations are adopted according to whether a satisfactory solution is obtained [21]. When the satisfactory solution is obtained, the structure pruning mutation is carried out. For the pruned structure network population, the connection weight evolutionary learning is carried out. When the satisfactory"
"solution is obtained [21]. When the satisfactory solution is obtained, the structure pruning mutation is carried out. For the pruned structure network population, the connection weight evolutionary learning is carried out. When the satisfactory solution is not obtained and the evolution is stagnant, the structure growth mutation is carried out. Then, the connection weight evolutionary learning is carried out for the new structure scale network population. When the structure pruning evolution stops, the evolutionary learning process is ended and the satisfactory optimal solution obtained by evolutionary learning is determined [22].The overall evolutionary neural network process is shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe detailed steps of the algorithm are as follows.(i)Initialize the population, as shown in the following formula:(9)(ii)The connection weight learning algorithm process is described in the following algorithm process. If the evolution stagnates or a satisfactory solution is obtained, end the connection right learning and move to the next step 3. Otherwise, continue the connection right learning process.3.3. Effectiveness AnalysisFor the initial structural network population, if the satisfactory solution is obtained, the structural modification variation and connection weight learning can be carried out. Otherwise, when the satisfactory solution is not obtained, the evolution of connection weight stagnates. It shows that the current population does"
"is obtained, the structural modification variation and connection weight learning can be carried out. Otherwise, when the satisfactory solution is not obtained, the evolution of connection weight stagnates. It shows that the current population does not have the structure to obtain satisfactory solutions, and only structural growth variation and connection weight learning can be carried out [23]. For structural growth evolutionary learning, the learning process will end only when a satisfactory solution is obtained. It is worth noting that the structure of the satisfactory solution network obtained at this time is often not satisfactory and optimal. For structural pruning evolutionary learning, when evolution stagnates and a satisfactory solution cannot be obtained, it indicates that the current population does not have the ability to obtain a satisfactory solution. It is determined that the best individual of the population before this pruning is the learning network with the smallest structural scale and the satisfactory optimal solution network.4.

Since the management mode of students in our school is school work office ⟶ student management office of colleges and departments ⟶ teachers (mainly head teachers) and the head teachers are the direct managers of class students, some basic data of the student management information system need to be provided by the head teachers [24].

Effective Methods of Ideological and Political Work in the Internet+ Era5.1. Existing Problems and Challenges of Ideological and Political Work in Colleges and Universities5.1.1. Traditional Problems and Challenges(1) Thoughts and politics are dogmatic and difficult to adapt to new situations and changes in the new environment: at present, the method of ideological and political work has not completely got rid of the way of preaching. It is lack of innovation and difficulty to attract students. In the Internet+ era, students have been fully exposed to various external ideas and concepts, and there has been a trend of diversification.

"It is the responsibility of our ideological and political teachers in colleges and universities to guide college students to consciously maintain consistency in the main theme, promote positive energy, and identify those ideas that run counter to the main theme. However, if the working methods follow dogmatism and teach students through orders and preaching, it will be difficult to tell wonderful things. If students cannot listen, they cannot achieve the effect of education.(2) Emphasis on academic performance, light ideological and political education, and lack of easiness to operate students' ideological and political assessment standards: in some cases, the ranking and measurement of student achievement in various awards are very rigorous and important. Students' ideological and political research is difficult; they do not pay attention to personal moral cultivation and do not strengthen ideological and political education and politics, and the operational measures of students' \"ideological and political morality\" are weak. As a result, some students only pay attention to professional learning and do not pay attention to personal ideological and political learning and moral cultivation.5.1.2. New Problems and Challenges in the Internet+ Era(1) The ideological constraints of college students in the virtual world are weakened and easy to be affected by bad thoughts: the biggest difference between the Internet era and the non-Internet era is that in the latter, people's life"
"the Internet+ Era(1) The ideological constraints of college students in the virtual world are weakened and easy to be affected by bad thoughts: the biggest difference between the Internet era and the non-Internet era is that in the latter, people's life circle is mainly acquaintances, and the behavior of college students mainly depends on the supervision of acquaintances, surrounding people and social public opinion and their inner beliefs. In the virtual world in the Internet+ era, on the one hand, without \"acquaintances and people around,\" everyone can be anonymous and unknown, which is easy to create the illusion that everyone does not know me. Therefore, it is difficult for acquaintances and public opinion to supervise. They mainly rely on their inner beliefs to supervise their behavior, which may lead to the weakening of college students' self-discipline. On the other hand, for college students, using the Internet has become a common way of life for college students. While the Internet brings all kinds of convenience, it also greatly affects their values, outlook on life, and world outlook. If students are influenced by bad thoughts, they may lead to all kinds of bad behaviors of some college students with poor self-discipline, which will harm all aspects. These new problems put forward new requirements for ideological and political education.(2) In the real world, college students' face-to-face communication ability deteriorates: the life of contemporary college"

These new problems put forward new requirements for ideological and political education.(2) In the real world, college students' face-to-face communication ability deteriorates: the life of contemporary college students is inseparable from the network. Many exchanges rely on various chat softwares. Some college students are easy to indulge in the virtual world of the network for a long time. Face-to-face communication between people is becoming less and less, which has become a common phenomenon among college students.5.2.

Some bad information will have an adverse effect on the thinking of college students, which requires us to pay close attention to the hot data on the Internet and the bad information that boys may encounter and respond and share in a timely manner [28]. On the other hand, college students rely on social networking every day. They should give full play to the role of the network, actively communicate with them, understand and find problems in time, and dredge and solve them.5.2.2. Constructing a New Measurement Method of Paying Equal Attention to Academic Achievement and Ideological and Political WorkEstablish a comprehensive scientific standard or measurement to evaluate students' ideological and moral character. This measurement can not only quantify the quality of students in all aspects but also have the characteristics of easy operation. At the same time, the measurement of emotional and political and academic performance has been incorporated into the new measurement model, and the performance of the students has been extensively measured and researched on the purpose.5.2.3. Occupy the Dominance of Internet Discourse and Spread Positive EnergyIn response to the negative impact that some of the ideas on the Internet can have on college students, on the one hand, educators and politicians need to pay close attention to collaborate in real time and spread the word more in purpose and work in the management of public opinion online through the use of social"
"the Internet can have on college students, on the one hand, educators and politicians need to pay close attention to collaborate in real time and spread the word more in purpose and work in the management of public opinion online through the use of social platforms frequently. On the other hand, we should also take the initiative to use social software to maintain regular and timely communication with students; understand the latest ideological trends, hobbies, and habits of students; pay attention to students' learning status; solve problems encountered in students' study and life; and care for students. By allowing students to participate in the production of small online videos with positive energy, online consultation, online interaction, smart classroom, and other ways, use the Internet to improve students' interest and enthusiasm in participating in ideological and political education, carry out rich and colorful educational publicity activities, and strive to be students' bosom friends and life mentors.5.2.4. Effective Use of Web-Based Technology and Management PlatformsEducators work through a web-based management platform, freeing them from many cumbersome approval processes and reducing waste of documents, paper, and other materials. At the same time, educators have more experience to devote to teaching and learning. In the past, reference materials, extra reading materials, and practice questions could be made available to students through online channels, that"
"and other materials. At the same time, educators have more experience to devote to teaching and learning. In the past, reference materials, extra reading materials, and practice questions could be made available to students through online channels, that is, they could be easily accessed at any time and kept for a long time, reducing excessive waste of paper. For examinations, they can also be made available in an online format, increasing the speed of marking, reducing the amount of paper used for examinations, saving energy, and reducing carbon. On the other hand, students become aware of the importance of environmental protection during their studies and are implicitly involved in environmental activities.6.

"educational administration process of colleges and universities, the basic requirements for realizing the system are obtained. On this basis, the daily student information management business is analyzed, and the student information management system is designed according to the analysis results, which can help students, managers, and teachers manage information efficiently. The implementation of this website based on ASPNET technology environment has the advantages of openness, high performance, security, and low cost. Under the guidance of software engineering strategies, we use state-of-the-art technology to integrate system management and independence, giving full play to the quality of the network in data management and improving the operational efficiency of the system. At the same time, the system has mobility and versatility, which will help improve the performance of the students' information management system. As a case management system for undergraduate students, student management, especially the refinement of thought and politics, must be integrated with the background of the \"Internet+\" era and the frequent responses to the challenges brought by it. Develop a \"Internet+\" concept, effectively use the Internet platform to work on the management of thought and politics in colleges and universities, patiently learn, full use and develop state-of-the-art technology, hold on to ideas in online thought management and political education in a timely manner, and"
