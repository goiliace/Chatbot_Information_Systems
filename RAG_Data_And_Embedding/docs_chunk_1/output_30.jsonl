System Optimization TestBlack box testing is often used to test the overall functionality of software and the functionality of software with graphical interfaces and the external structure of the program, and the black box testing method requires that the testing of the modules that divide the system be explicit and then test the input and output for each module, and then, the output results are actually tested to compare the actual output of the system with the ideal output of the user, and if they are not consistent, then a preliminary decision can be made that a function of the functional module is problematic, with exceptions and usually for testing the exception location method. The next white-box testing method is needed to analyze the detection. In the analysis from a macro-micro perspective, software testing methods can be divided into"
"is problematic, with exceptions and usually for testing the exception location method. The next white-box testing method is needed to analyze the detection. In the analysis from a macro-micro perspective, software testing methods can be divided into two main black box testing as well as white box testing; the so-called black box testing functional testing uses the software system that has an opaque black box, from a macro perspective that is only able to operate the input data for the system, to determine the output of the system and whether the user expects the results to be consistent; black box testing mainly focused on the input and output system, the system from a system. White box testing perspective and testing methodologies corner the code to cover all branches, all statements in the program code for all possible errors, a comprehensive traversal of the test.Of course, traversing all branches,ccan simplify the number of test case quality and is a worthy issue for discussion; white box testing has been widely used in software development work, helping developers to strive to find software defects and fix them in time. White box testing is transparent; white box testing mainly comes from testing, testing internal software products from the details, and the correction of problems found during the testing process. In the two phases of the software life cycle, software testing, which usually takes place after writing each module, is also called unit testing. Coding and"

In the two phases of the software life cycle, software testing, which usually takes place after writing each module, is also called unit testing. Coding and unit testing belong to the same phase of the software life cycle; the software system does various comprehensive tests after the end of this phase, which is another phase of the software life cycle; the testing phase is very meaningful, as shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointComprehensive test of systematic induction.Test case is the process of software testing scenario test; test cases are used to determine whether the function of the software product is normal; test cases are often selected representative of some typical data, often by data analysts of the system's critical points, failure-prone points for analysis and extraction so as to design test cases, the system according to different functional modules, and test cases to design different programs; there are certain functional modules of the test of software test cases that are often targeted, comprehensive, and representative.

"AbstractConsidering the competition between rescue points, we use artificial intelligence (AI) driven Internet of Thing (IoT) and regional material storage data to propose a multiobjective scheduling algorithm of flood control materials based on Pareto artificial bee colony (MSA_PABC). To address the scheduling of flood control materials, the multiple types of flood control materials, the multiple disaster sites, and entertain both emergency and fairness of rescue need to be considered comprehensively. The MSA_PABC has the constraints such as storage quantity constraint of warehouse materials, material demand constraint, and maximum transportation distance of flood control materials. We establish the scheduling optimization model of flood control materials for each disaster rescue point and the total scheduling optimization model for all flood control materials. Then, MSA_PABC uses the modified Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the multiobjective models. Three types of initialization strategies are proposed to calculate the fitness of each rescue point and the overall evaluation value of the food source. We propose the employ bee operations such as niche technology and local search of the variable neighborhood, the onlooker bee operations such as Pareto nondominated sorting and crossover operation, the scout bee operations such as maximum evolutionary threshold, and end elimination mechanism.

"the onlooker bee operations such as Pareto nondominated sorting and crossover operation, the scout bee operations such as maximum evolutionary threshold, and end elimination mechanism. Finally, our proposed solution obtains the nondominated solution set and its optimal solution. The experimental results show that no matter how the number of rescue points changes, MSA_PABC can find the nondominated solution set and optimal solution quickly. It improves the convergence rate of MSA_PABC and material satisfaction rate. Our solution also reduces the average maximum transportation distance, the standard deviation of maximum transportation distance, and the standard deviation of material satisfaction rate. The evaluation also demonstrates MSA_PABC outperforms the state-of-arts such as ABC (artificial bee colony), NSGA2 (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm 2), and MOPSO (multiobjective particle swarm optimization).1. IntroductionChina has a vast territory, and the precipitation partially concentrates. The precipitations time and space distribution are uneven, and it does not match the distribution of population and cultivated land. Therefore, disasters such as floods and typhoons occur frequently, causing a large number of people to suffer disasters and huge economic losses [1]. For instance, in 2019, 130 million people are suffered from disasters such as typhoons. The direct economic losses were 327.09 billion RMB [2]. Zhejiang Province locates on the southeastern coast of"
"people to suffer disasters and huge economic losses [1]. For instance, in 2019, 130 million people are suffered from disasters such as typhoons. The direct economic losses were 327.09 billion RMB [2]. Zhejiang Province locates on the southeastern coast of China. Due to its special geographic location and climatic conditions, it is susceptible to typhoons and storms. However, the drainage capacity of Zhejiang Province is limited. Once the flood disasters occur, it will cause serious economic and loss of life to people. Therefore, flood prevention and rescue are particularly important [3]. In the past, rescue dispatching mainly issued dispatching instructions by means of communication. The problem lies in low efficiency and chaotic command. Once the scale of rescue dispatching rises, its order and efficiency will be more difficult to maintain.With the rapid development of computer technology, sensor technology, and Internet of Things technology, various industries in the market are developing in the direction of high automation and intelligence and hope to improve the service ability of the industry through AI and IOT technology [4,5]. The future development of flood control and disaster reduction in the direction of intelligence is gradually becoming a consensus in the industry.

"is gradually becoming a consensus in the industry. Internet of Things technology as a basic support means to determine the quantity and availability of materials through a variety of information sensing equipment and electronic tags in the field of flood control, and upload the relevant information to the Internet platform for information interaction to achieve intelligent management of materials. At the same time, it provides data support for the subsequent solution of large-scale orderly and efficient scheduling of materials. The dynamic scheduling problem of rescue materials is NP hard in nature. It is usually solved with various artificial intelligence algorithms based on the existing Internet of Things technology [6,7].At present, some scholars have achieved certain results in emergency dispatch, but the characteristics of flood control and rescue scheduling determine that the applicability of artificial intelligence algorithm needs to be analyzed objectively to ensure that the application has a certain quality of service. For instance, Song et al. [8] propose a double mutation improved differential evolution algorithm with the Pareto concept and establish a multisupply point to multirescue point emergency material scheduling model in the case of limited resources to minimize the total cost of distribution expenses and the largest missing loss. Tian et al. [9] take the urgency of different needs into consideration and establish a multiobjective mathematical model for"
"model in the case of limited resources to minimize the total cost of distribution expenses and the largest missing loss. Tian et al. [9] take the urgency of different needs into consideration and establish a multiobjective mathematical model for dynamic distribution scheduling. Then, they use a weighted particle swarm optimization algorithm with swarm intelligence to solve the model. However, the above algorithms are more likely to fall into local optimum with the increase of scheduling scale, which makes the reliability of rescue decline. Zhang et al. [10] propose a hybrid intelligent search algorithm based on two-dimensional NSGA-II and ant colony optimization to establish a multiobjective optimization model for concurrent allocation and scheduling of multiple emergency rescue materials. Some scholars [11-14] focus on establishing a material scheduling optimization model which considers multiple parameters and using genetic algorithms (GA), sequential linear programming algorithms (SLP), greedy algorithms, and other algorithms to solve the optimization model and obtain the optimal solution. However, the above algorithms do not consider the dynamic change of material demand in the rescue process to make the material scheduling lag behind.Some scholars [15-18] focus on establishing multiple target optimization models, such as minimizing the transportation time of materials and maximizing reliability.

"lag behind.Some scholars [15-18] focus on establishing multiple target optimization models, such as minimizing the transportation time of materials and maximizing reliability. Then, they use single or multiple hybrid algorithms, such as quick sorting genetic algorithm, harmony algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, Monte Carlo algorithm, and stepwise method, to obtain the optimal scheduling schemes. Considering the processing time of emergencies, Wex et al. [19] propose a decision support model for allocating existing rescue units to emergency action centers to improve the efficiency of incident handling and reduce casualties and economic losses in the reaction phase. Considering that the emergency supplies provided to rescue points may be insufficient or excessive, Chen et al. [20] take the minimization of the loss caused by insufficient material distribution and oversupply and the minimization of vehicle scheduling costs as optimization objectives and propose a vehicle scheduling optimization model of disaster emergency logistics based on discrete bee colony. In [8-20], they use intelligent optimization algorithms to solve emergency rescue scheduling problems but do not take account of the urgency and fairness of multiobjective rescue scheduling at the same time, only meet the rescue service requirements of individual rescue points, which makes the overall rescue service quality poor, and only focus on resource allocation, without considering the unexpected factors"
"rescue scheduling at the same time, only meet the rescue service requirements of individual rescue points, which makes the overall rescue service quality poor, and only focus on resource allocation, without considering the unexpected factors that affect the service quality such as road damage in the rescue process.Therefore, based on the algorithms mentioned above, we propose a multiobjective scheduling algorithm of flood control materials based on Pareto artificial bee colony (MSA_PABC). Considering the convergence performance of the algorithm, the feasibility of the actual road transportation in the process of material allocation, and the satisfaction of the allocation between rescue points and the whole rescue, we establish the optimization model of flood control material scheduling for each disaster relief point and the optimization model of all flood control materials scheduling from the time cost, task execution reliability, and service satisfaction. According to the importance and easy measurement of service quality parameters, we select service quality parameters and establish a parameter system including four service quality parameters (transportation efficiency, satisfaction rate of disaster site, transportation reliability, and actual availability of material reserve), which is used as constraint function to guide the optimization objective of an artificial intelligence scheduling algorithm, that is, we propose the modified Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm"
"reliability, and actual availability of material reserve), which is used as constraint function to guide the optimization objective of an artificial intelligence scheduling algorithm, that is, we propose the modified Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the multiobjective optimization model. In the initial phase, we propose a variety of food source initialization strategies and calculate the fitness of each rescue point and the overall evaluation value of the food source. In the employed bee phase, we use niche technology and variable neighborhood local search and other employ bee operations to strengthen the local search of the food source. In the onlooker bee phase, we use Pareto dominate sorting, crossover operation, and other onlooker operations to expand the search capabilities of high-quality food sources in areas with small distribution densities in the multidimensional solution space. In the scout bee phase, we use the maximum evolution threshold and end-elimination mechanism to continuously update old food sources to ensure the diversity of solutions. Finally, MSA_PABC can quickly find nondominated sets and optimal solutions, thereby improving the convergence rate and material satisfaction rate and reducing the average maximum transport distance, standard deviation of the maximum transport distance, and standard deviation of material satisfaction rate for flood control materials to achieve the overall optimal rescue service quality with practical"
"reducing the average maximum transport distance, standard deviation of the maximum transport distance, and standard deviation of material satisfaction rate for flood control materials to achieve the overall optimal rescue service quality with practical feasibility.2. Scheduling Model EstablishmentThe flood control emergency scheduling is a prerequisite for realizing rapid and accurate handling of dangerous situations. Therefore, it is necessary to take the actual storage of warehouse materials and situations of disasters of each region as influencing factors. According to flood control materials constraints of storage capacity, demand, and transportation, we establish the scheduling optimization model of flood control materials for each disaster rescue point and the total scheduling optimization model of all flood control materials. The details are as follows:We setto represent the storage capacity of flood control materialkin warehousei. Considering the number of flood control materialkallocated by the storage warehouseito all rescue points does not exceed the total storage of flood control materialskin the storage warehousei, the storage capacity constrain of warehouse materials is(1)whererepresents the number of flood control materialkallocated by warehouseito rescue pointj.To avoid wastage and use the flood control materials effectively, it is required that the number of flood control materialkfrom all warehouses to rescue pointjdoes not exceed the required quantity of"
"materialkallocated by warehouseito rescue pointj.To avoid wastage and use the flood control materials effectively, it is required that the number of flood control materialkfrom all warehouses to rescue pointjdoes not exceed the required quantity of the flood control materialkin the rescue pointj. Thus, the material demand constraint is(2)whererepresents the required quantity of the flood control materialkin the rescue pointj.According to the value, we can know the storage warehouses and rescue points that need to be passed during flood control materials transportation. We assume that the transport capacity is adequate during the transportation of flood control materials. Then, according to the GIS system and the distribution of flood disasters, we determine the shortest transportation distanceof the flood control materialkbetween the storage warehouseiand the rescue pointjthat can avoid flooding inundated roads [21]. Thus, we can obtain the maximum transportation distance for finishing the flood control material scheduling at rescue pointj.(3)whereDjrepresents the maximum distance required to finish the transportation of flood control materials at rescue pointj.To meet the demand for rescue points for flood control materials, the material satisfaction rate of rescue pointjis(4)whereRjrepresents the material satisfaction rate of rescue pointj.In the aspect of disaster rescue points, each of them hopes that the required flood control materials can meet the fastest"
"materials, the material satisfaction rate of rescue pointjis(4)whereRjrepresents the material satisfaction rate of rescue pointj.In the aspect of disaster rescue points, each of them hopes that the required flood control materials can meet the fastest transportation time and the maximum satisfaction rate. We establish a scheduling optimization model of flood control materials for each disaster rescue pointj.(5)In the aspect of flood control material scheduling management, the flood control materials can weigh the principle of urgency and fairness. Therefore, we set the standard deviation of the maximum transportation distance of flood control materials is(6)whereStdwrepresents the standard deviation of the maximum transportation distances of flood control materials andNJrepresents the number of rescue points. The standard deviation of the satisfaction rate of flood control materials is(7)where Ratwrepresents the standard deviation of the satisfaction rate of flood control materials. Considering the emergency of flood control materials, it is required to send all flood control materials to all rescue points as quickly and as fully as possible. And in terms of the fairness of flood control materials, it is required that the maximum transportation distance and satisfaction rate between rescue points are not much different. The standard deviation of maximum transportation distances and the standard deviation of material satisfaction rates need to be minimized. Therefore, we"
"maximum transportation distance and satisfaction rate between rescue points are not much different. The standard deviation of maximum transportation distances and the standard deviation of material satisfaction rates need to be minimized. Therefore, we establish the total scheduling optimization model of all flood control materials.(8)whereDaverepresents the maximum average distance required to finish flood control materials transportation,Raverepresents the average material satisfaction rate of rescue points,x1represents the distance factor,x2represents the satisfaction rate factor, andx1+x2= 1.3. Scheduling Model EstablishmentSince the models (5) and (8) consider the selection of three elements, such as the storage warehouse, rescue point, and flood control material, the optimization model is complicated and involves a lot of calculations. Therefore, we use artificial intelligence to solve the optimization models (5) and (8) and obtain the optimal plan by constantly searching for the distribution scheme of reserve warehouses, rescue points, and flood control materials. The inspiration of the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) proposed by Karaboga et al. [22] is based on bee foraging behavior. In ABC, the artificial bee colony comprises three kinds of bees, such as employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees are associated with a specific food source.

"colony comprises three kinds of bees, such as employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees are associated with a specific food source. The onlooker bees observe the dance of employed bees in the hive to decide to choose a certain food source and conduct a local search for the selected food source. The scout bees randomly search for food to avoid local optimal solutions. The traditional ABC algorithm can effectively solve the optimization problem of a single objective function. It has the characteristics of a few parameters and fast convergence speed. However, according to the model (5), there are multiple rescue points. Each rescue point needs to make its optimization model as optimal as possible. The problem of flood control material scheduling optimization is a multiobjective optimization problem in which multiple rescue points compete with each other. Therefore, we introduce the Pareto nondominated sorting and propose a multiobjective scheduling algorithm of flood control materials based on Pareto artificial bee colony to solve the scheduling problem of flood control materials between rescue points. Then, we can obtain the nondominated sets and find the optimal solution in the nondominated set based on the model (5). Thus, we obtain the flood control material scheduling schemes that weigh disaster rescue points and flood control scheduling management in the case of multiple types of flood control materials and multiple disaster rescue points.3.1. Food"
"the model (5). Thus, we obtain the flood control material scheduling schemes that weigh disaster rescue points and flood control scheduling management in the case of multiple types of flood control materials and multiple disaster rescue points.3.1. Food Source InitializationSince the traditional ABC algorithm cannot be directly used to solve the scheduling problem, we precode the problem solution and uses a one-dimensional vector coding method with variable length to solve the flood control material scheduling decision problem. The food source code is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of one-dimensional encoding of food source.Where the storage warehouse represents the storage location of flood control materials in various regions, according to the location of the rescue points and the demands of flood control materials in advance, the algorithm needs to select the storage warehouse set that can meet the flood control materials all rescue points.a1 represents the storage warehouse number 1.b1 represents the rescue point number 1. The numbers in the table represent the amount of certain flood control materials transported. A good initial solution set can enable the algorithm to quickly find the areas with great potential in the entire solution space and speed up the algorithm's convergence. Then, it provides a variety of different types of food sources to avoid the algorithm from falling into a local optimum [23]. In the paper, we use the"
"the areas with great potential in the entire solution space and speed up the algorithm's convergence. Then, it provides a variety of different types of food sources to avoid the algorithm from falling into a local optimum [23]. In the paper, we use the following three rules in the food source initialization phase.(1)Large Storage Warehouse First.Due to the different types of flood control materials stored in each storage warehouse, each flood control material is also different. According to the actual material storage quantity of the warehouse, flood control materials are distributed based on roulette rules in the same set. The warehouse with a large storage quantity can be a priority to assign scheduling tasks [24](2)Disaster Demand First.Different rescue points have different demands for flood control materials. In the same set, according to the demand for flood control materials at each rescue point, flood control materials are preferentially distributed based on roulette rules to rescue points with high demand for materials(3)Random Distribution.Flood control materials are distributed randomlyThe three rules mentioned above generate each initial solution. The solution set ratios are, respectively, set to 30%, 30%, and 40%. In the distribution process, each initial allocation value is the minimum of the warehouse material storage and material demand [25] to meet the constraint (1). Then, the food source is considered whether meets the constraint (2); if the constraint (2)"
"In the distribution process, each initial allocation value is the minimum of the warehouse material storage and material demand [25] to meet the constraint (1). Then, the food source is considered whether meets the constraint (2); if the constraint (2) is not met, the overallocated materials are reduced to avoid repeated scheduling for materials. The food sources that met the constraints (1)-(2) are obtained.3.2. Fitness Value CalculationFor urgency and fairness of flood control materials' emergency scheduling, we establish a scheduling optimization model of flood control materials. In the phases of employed bees and onlooker bees, we need to calculate the fitnessFjof each rescue point and perform the operations such as niche and minimum dominating set selection, which is(9)When the algorithm is solved, according to the minimum dominating set, we obtained, calculating the overall evaluation valueFzof all food sources in its set, and select the food source with the maximum value as the optimal solution of MSA_PABC.(10)3.3. Employed Bee PhaseAccording to the food sources generated in Section3.1, employed bees divide the whole food source into subcategories according to the number of rescue points. After that, employed bees search for the unknown solution space near each food source by variable neighborhood local search operation to obtain multiple child food sources. Then, we analyze the relationship between the child's food source and the father's food source and obtain the"
"for the unknown solution space near each food source by variable neighborhood local search operation to obtain multiple child food sources. Then, we analyze the relationship between the child's food source and the father's food source and obtain the next food source. Finally, we use the elite retention and exclusion strategy in the niche to restore the food source's size to the original size. The niche operation and variable neighborhood local search operation are as follows.3.3.1. Niche OperationNiche is a conception of biology. It refers to a living environment under a specific environment. In the biological evolution process, organisms always live with the same species and breed offspring together. Niche technology divides each generation of individuals into several categories and selects some individuals with greater fitness as an outstanding representative class to form a species, then uses the elite retention and exclusion strategy in the species and between different species to generate a new generation of individual groups.For individual fitness valueFjmentioned in Section3.2, MSA_PABC calculates the fitness valueFjfor each food source and normalizes it. It classifies the food source into the subclass population with the highest fitness valueFjafter normalization and divides the entire food source population into subcategories. For the maximum fitness value [Fjwithin its child species, MSA_PABC performs the variable neighborhood search operation to enhance"
"with the highest fitness valueFjafter normalization and divides the entire food source population into subcategories. For the maximum fitness value [Fjwithin its child species, MSA_PABC performs the variable neighborhood search operation to enhance algorithm's the local optimization algorithm and obtains multiple new food sources. If the new food source dominates the old food source, the old food source is updated. Otherwise, if the old food source dominates the new food source, it deletes the new food source and keeps the old food sources. Then, it places the new food sources in the temporary food source set. After finishing the variable neighborhood search operation, MSA_PABC merges the food source set and the temporary food source set into the next generation of species.At last, MSA_PABC calculates the number of food sources in the next generation. Suppose the number of food sources exceeds the initial size. In that case, it randomly selects multiple food sources in the population to form an exclusion member set. It calculates the similarity between other food sources and exclusion members in the next generation. It selects the current food source and calculates the number of the same value at each same code position of each exclusion committee. It chooses the maximum value as the same degreeAiof the food and calculates the difference sum of the values at the same code position of the food source. Then, it selects the maximum value as the difference degreeBiof the food"
"each exclusion committee. It chooses the maximum value as the same degreeAiof the food and calculates the difference sum of the values at the same code position of the food source. Then, it selects the maximum value as the difference degreeBiof the food source. According to the same degree, MSA_PABC sorts those food sources from small to large. If there are multiple food sources with the same degree, it sorts those food sources from small to large according to the different degree and obtains the sorted food sources. Then, it eliminates front foods in turn until the population returns to its original size. If the eliminated food source is the optimal local solution or the optimal global solution in the offspring population, it skips the food source and reserves the elite solution.3.3.2. Variable Neighborhood Local Search OperationA variable neighborhood local search method is an improved local search method. It utilizes a neighborhood structure formed by different actions to perform an alternate search and achieves a good balance between concentration and evacuation. The maximum loop search threshold is set as the termination condition to keep the efficiency and the accuracy of the algorithm. To facilitate the search operation of variable neighborhood, the initial food source has to be transformed into a multidimensional real matrixQijv. As shown in Figure2, whereirepresents the storage warehouse (rowa).jrepresents the rescue point (subordinate columnsb).vrepresents the type"
"of variable neighborhood, the initial food source has to be transformed into a multidimensional real matrixQijv. As shown in Figure2, whereirepresents the storage warehouse (rowa).jrepresents the rescue point (subordinate columnsb).vrepresents the type of flood control material.Qrepresents the quantity of flood control materials (the value in Figure2). Suppose some storage warehouses do not have a certain amount of flood control materials. In that case, theQvalue is the Nan identifier; then, MSA_PABC skips theNanidentifier automatically during the calculation to improve search efficiency. The Niche strategy divides the food sources into classes based on the number of rescue points (i.e.,b1,b2,b3, ⋯,bn). For rescue pointbiamong food sources belonging to thebicategory, it performs the variable neighborhood search to improve the resource scheduling optimization of the rescue point and the mutual competitiveness between the rescue points. Thus, it obtains some local optimal food sources. As shown in Figure2, we assume that it belongs to theb1 category. Then, MSA_PABC conducts a variable neighborhood search for the flood control material distribution at the rescue pointb1. The specific steps of the variable neighborhood search method are described as follows.(11)whereQijvrepresents quantityQijvof flood control materialvfrom each storage warehouse to the rescue pointbjwhich redistributes them to the rescue pointbw.Step 1.According to thebwcategory to which the food source belongs,"

Then, it initializes the maximum number of variable neighborhood searches and selects the first column of flood control materials in rescue pointbw. The number of neighborhood searches is 0.Step 2.Getting current flood control materialv, the method searches for other rescue points with the flood control materials and selects a rescue pointbjrandomly.Step 3.The method finds the quantityQijvof flood control materialvfrom each storage warehouse to the rescue pointbjand redistributes them to the rescue pointbw.

IfQcwv≥L, thenQcwv=Qcwv−L,Qcjv=Qcjv+Land skip to step 5. Otherwise,Qcwv= 0,Qcjv=Qcwv,L=L−Qcjvand return to step 4.Step 5.If the method has completed the"

Otherwise,Qcwv= 0,Qcjv=Qcwv,L=L−Qcjvand return to step 4.Step 5.If the method has completed the search for variable neighborhoods of all flood control materials in the rescue pointbj, it skips stepping 6. Otherwise, it selects the next flood control material and skips to step 2.Step 6.If the method obtains a child food source and the number of variable neighborhood searches is smaller than the maximum number of variable neighborhood searches, it reselects the first column of flood control materials in the rescue pointbw; then, the number of variable neighborhood searches adds 1 and skips to step 2. Otherwise, it ends and outputs multiple new food sources.As shown in Figure2, we assume that the demands of sandstoneb1are 20, and the demands of sandstoneb3are 30. Then,v= 1 and it only represents the sandstone. There is no sandstone inb2, andb3has sandstone; thus,Q011= [2, 4, 3]. The subscript 0 represents all of the storage warehousesa1,a2, anda3. We randomly select the value of sandstone materialb3asQ032= [2, 9, 12]. First, we setQ111= 2 + 3 = 5,Q211= 4 + 9 = 13, andQ111= 3 + 2 = 5. Due to the current number of sandstone inb1exceeds its demands, it does not meet the constraints (1) and (2).

"3 + 2 = 5. Due to the current number of sandstone inb1exceeds its demands, it does not meet the constraints (1) and (2). Then, we randomly select the storage warehouse and return the remaining value to the rescue pointb3. Finally, we operate on each flood control material inb1, so as to realize variable neighborhood search operation and output new food sources.3.4. Onlooker Bees PhaseMSA_PABC calculates the fitness valueFj(i) of each rescue point for every food source by formula (9) and obtains aNs×Njdata matrixM. Among them,Fj(i) represents the fitness value of rescue pointjin food sourcei.Nsrepresents the number of food sources.Njrepresents the number of rescue points. According to each rescue point's fitness value, it sorts each column of data in the matrixMto obtain the neighbor individualsi+ 1 andi− 1 of each element in the matrixMand their fitness values. Then, it calculates the crowdedness through the Euclidean distance value between individuali+ 1 and individuali− 1. That is, it calculates the sum of the differences in the individual fitness valueFjfor each target. The solution with the maximum and minimum values is specified as the infinite distance, that is, the boundary solutiond1=dy= infinity.(12)wheredirepresents the crowdedness of theith food source,yrepresents the maximum boundary index,represents the maximum fitness value of rescue pointjamong all food sources, andrepresents the minimum fitness value of rescue pointjamong all food sources. In the solution"
"the crowdedness of theith food source,yrepresents the maximum boundary index,represents the maximum fitness value of rescue pointjamong all food sources, andrepresents the minimum fitness value of rescue pointjamong all food sources. In the solution set, the part of solutions concentrates in a certain area and distributes sparsely in some areas; therefore, according to the crowdedness of food sources, MSA_PABC sorts the solutions in descending order to obtain the spatial measure of food sources with surrounding neighbors. The selected probability of the food source is calculated by the formula (13).(13)whererepresents the selected probability of theith food source in the solution set. According to the measurement results, the crossover operation is performed on the entire population, the search space is expanded, and the number of solutions at each dominating level and the Pareto curve are increased to provide more choices for decision-making. Namely, MSA_PABC sets the crossover probabilityrin advance and cyclically implements the following operations until finishing the crossover of each type of flood control materials: in the range [0,1], it randomly generates a floating-point numberr1. Ifr1 <r, it will cross thekth element of the two selected food sources. Otherwise, it does not change the amount of flood control materials in the food source. After finishing the cross operation, it is necessary to verify whether the newly generated food sources satisfy the constraints (1)"
"of the two selected food sources. Otherwise, it does not change the amount of flood control materials in the food source. After finishing the cross operation, it is necessary to verify whether the newly generated food sources satisfy the constraints (1) and (2). If it does not, the overallocated materials will be cut to obtain the new food sources which meet the constraints. Then, new food sources add to contemporary populations.MSA_PABC implements the retain Pareto nondominated strategy by formula (12), that is, it compares the fitness value of each rescue point of any two food sources. If the fitness value of each rescue point in one food source is greater than or equal to the fitness value of each rescue point in another food source, and there is at least the fitness value of one rescue point greater than the fitness value of the corresponding rescue point in another food source, it represents that the food source dominates another food source. Therefore, it can obtain a set of nondominated solution setsMFthat are not dominated by other solutions.(14)whereκandλrepresent the two food sources in the entire set of solution spaces andFj( ) represents the fitness value of thejth rescue point of the food source. If the number of food sources in the solution set exceeds the initial scale, it sorts the food sources in the population in descending order by the overall evaluation valueFzand eliminates the poor food source solutions to restore the population to its original scale."
"of food sources in the solution set exceeds the initial scale, it sorts the food sources in the population in descending order by the overall evaluation valueFzand eliminates the poor food source solutions to restore the population to its original scale. Otherwise, it will add the initialized food sources to bring it back to the original scale.3.5. Scout Bee PhaseAfter completing the above two phases, scout bees select the food source in the last certain proportion of the food source population and implement the initialize operation in Section3.1for the same number of times to initialize the food source. Then, it adopts the greedy strategy to update old food sources. Because the entire food source population may have food sources with the same fitness value, it chooses the duplicate and redundant food source and the food source whose fitness value does not change after the maximum numberUof evolution iterations. Then, it uses the food source initialization operation in Section3.1to initialize the food source to ensure the diversity of the entire population and prevent it from falling into a local optimum.4. Algorithm ImplementationAs shown in Figure3, we mainly use the MSA_PABC to solve the model. In the initialization phase of the algorithm, it is necessary to set the model's data and the initial parameters of the algorithm. The specific steps are as follows:Step 1.MSA_PABC obtains each warehouse pointaand rescue pointbin the city and obtains the number of types of"

The specific steps are as follows:Step 1.MSA_PABC obtains each warehouse pointaand rescue pointbin the city and obtains the number of types of materials and the number of specific materials in each warehouse. Then, it sets the initial data, such as the total number of food sources in the population, the maximum number of evolutionU, the maximum number of local searchesm1 in the variable neighborhood, and the number of onlooker beesm2.Step 2.According to the principle of large-scale storage warehouses first, disaster demands first and randomly distribution, MSA_PABC generates the initial food source, and the proportion of food sources is 30%, 30%, and 40%. Then, it modifies the food source by reducing the excessively distributed materials so that all food sources satisfy the constraints (1) and (2).Step 3.MSA_PABC calculates the individual fitness valueFJand overall optimal evaluation valueFzof food sources.Step 4.MSA_PABC enters the employed bee phase. According to the number of rescue points, it divides the entire food source population intoNJ-independent child populations by the niche technology. It implements the variable neighborhood search operation to find a locally optimal solution for each food source. Thereby, it obtainsm1 food sources.

"variable neighborhood search operation to find a locally optimal solution for each food source. Thereby, it obtainsm1 food sources. If the new food source dominates the old food source, then it updates the old food source. If the old food source dominates the new food source, then it deletes the new food source. Otherwise, it temporarily stores new food sources without changing the old food source and puts them in temporary food source collections. Completing the variable neighborhood search operation merges the food source set with the temporary food source set. Subsequently, it eliminates similar food sources through the elite retention strategy and the niche exclusion strategy to restore the food source collection's size to its original size.Step 5.MSA_PABC enters the onlooker bee phase. Calculating the crowdedness among food sources by formula (11) to determine the selected probability of each food source, it implements the following operation form2 times and obtainsm2∗2 child food sources: it chooses a food source based on the rules of roulette and selects the neighbor food source with nearest European distance; then, it performs across the operation to generate two food sources and corrects the new two food sources to obtain two-child food sources satisfying the constraints (1) and (2).

Them2∗2 child food sources and the food sources in the current population combine into a food source set, and MSA_PABC performs the Pareto dominance strategy on the food source set to obtain a nondominated solution set. According to the overall evaluation optimal valueFz, it eliminates the poor food source solution so that the population number returns to the original size.Step 6.MSA_PABC enters the scout bee phase. It implements the final elimination method to rerandomly initialize a certain proportion of the food sources at the end of the ranking. Then, it uses the greedy strategy to update the old food sources. AfterUiterations, if the food source's overall value does not change, it reinitializes the food source. Simultaneously, the current population retains and updates the new global optimal solution and historical optimal solution based on the greedy strategy.Step 7.MSA_PABC determines whether the number of loop iterations is equal to the maximum number of iterations. It outputs a nondominated solution set and outputs the optimal solution for an overall evaluation. Otherwise, it goes to step (3).Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointAlgorithm flow chart.5.

Using the simulation parameters shown in Table1, we carry out simulation experiments in simulated disaster scenarios. We analyze the distribution of nondominated solution sets and the convergence of MSA_PABC, the effects of the number of food sources, crossover probability, the maximum number of evolutions, and end elimination ratio on the optimal solution evaluation value in 10 different disaster scenarios.

NSGA2 carries out the fast nondominated sorting strategy with elite retention. It selects the solution with the most extensive evaluation value as the final solution in the nondominated solution set. MOPSO realizes the scheduling optimization of flood control materials through the second set and adaptive grid method and selects the final resolution according to the evaluation value.

"distribution of those 2 groups of rescue points. As shown in Figure5, the scheduling problem of flood control materials is the distribution problem of rescue points and warehouses. Therefore, it is a combination of multiple distribution schemes and is discrete. Its optimal Pareto nondominated solution set does not present continuous dense data points and only offers a distribution of 10 points. However, its data points achieve the optimal fitness value without reducing the fitness values of another group and still show the Pareto curve's characteristics. As shown in Figure6, MSA_PABC uses a niche method and variable neighborhood local search method in the employed bee operation to improve the convergence ability and ensure that the offspring can optimally inherit the current optimal food source as far as possible. In the onlooker bee phase, MSA_PABC uses a crossover strategy to enhance global search capability. In the scout bee phase, MSA_PABC sets the bee colony's maximum evolution threshold and uses an end elimination mechanism to update food sources with low evaluation values and delete food sources that cannot be evolved again. It expands the search capability, and the food source can grow faster in a favorable direction. Simultaneously, through the calculation of congestion and the maintenance of Pareto nondominated sets, MSA_PABC can quickly find and retain the optimal food source in history and improve its convergence accuracy. Therefore, MSA_PABC can discover the"
"Simultaneously, through the calculation of congestion and the maintenance of Pareto nondominated sets, MSA_PABC can quickly find and retain the optimal food source in history and improve its convergence accuracy. Therefore, MSA_PABC can discover the optimal evaluation value of the food source after 24 iterations.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution diagram of nondominated solution set in MSA_PABC.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointConvergence diagram of evaluation value of optimal solution in MSA_PABC.5.2.2. The Influence of Parameters on MSA_PABC(1) The Influence of the Number of Food Sources on MSA_PABC. We select the number of food sources 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. The number of rescue points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and other parameters in Table1calculate the average evaluation value of output solution in 10 disaster scenarios with different materials and analyze the influence of the number of food sources.As shown in Figure7, when the number of rescue points is 2, MSA_PABC can converge to the current optimal solution and obtain the optimal solution when solving the low-dimensional answer of flood control material scheduling. The evaluation values of the output solutions under different numbers of food sources remain the same. However, with the increase in the number of rescue points, the data dimension increases. When the number of food sources is small and the number of algorithm iterations is limited, in the process of searching for the optimal solution, the output"
"the same. However, with the increase in the number of rescue points, the data dimension increases. When the number of food sources is small and the number of algorithm iterations is limited, in the process of searching for the optimal solution, the output solution is easy to fall into the optimal local solution, and the maximum fitness value of the output solution is more considerable. Therefore, under different numbers of rescue points, when the number of food sources is 20, the output solution's evaluation value is the largest. As the number of food sources increases, the evaluation value of the output solution becomes smaller. When the numbers of food sources are 50 and 60, MSA_PABC can obtain the current optimal solution. The evaluation value of the output solution is the smallest, and the difference is not large. Therefore, we choose 50 food sources for a simulation experiment.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of the number of different food sources on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.(2) The Influence of Crossover Probability on MSA_PABC. We choose the crossover probability 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, the number of rescue points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and other parameters in Table1analyze the crossover probability's influence on the evaluation value of output solution.As shown in Figure8, when the number of rescue points is 2, MSA_PABC has better convergence when solving multiobjective low-dimensional data.

"the crossover probability's influence on the evaluation value of output solution.As shown in Figure8, when the number of rescue points is 2, MSA_PABC has better convergence when solving multiobjective low-dimensional data. They converge to the optimal solution under different crossover probability, and their evaluation values of output solution remain consistent. In the explanation of high-dimensional discrete problems of flood control materials, the low cross probability is difficult to achieve the goal of crossover, and the small number of food sources in the nondominated set and the high cross probability destroy the overall quality of the food source, which makes the algorithm more tend to be random. It also reduces the convergence of MSA_PABC and converges to the optimal local solution within a limited number of iterations. Therefore, under the number of rescue points, when the crossover probability is 0.2, the output solution's evaluation value is the smallest. When the crossover probability is 0.1, its evaluation value of the output solution is second. As the crossover probability increases after 0.2, the output solution's evaluation value becomes more extensive. Thus, we choose the crossover probability 0.2 for a simulation experiment.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different crossover probabilities on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.(3) The Influence of the Maximum Number of Evolutions on MSA_PABC.

"simulation experiment.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different crossover probabilities on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.(3) The Influence of the Maximum Number of Evolutions on MSA_PABC. We select the maximum number of evolutions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the number of rescue points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and other parameters in Table1analyze the influence of the maximum number of evolutions on the evaluation value of output solution.As shown in Figure9, although a minimal evolution threshold will improve the searchability of the solution space, it is a high probability to prevent high-quality solutions from being effectively inherited to the next generation of populations. It destroys the convergence effectiveness of MSA_PABC. However, a considerable evolution threshold will decrease the solution space's searchability as the number of algorithm iterations increases. Therefore, under different numbers of rescue points, when the maximum number of evolutions is 2, its evaluation value of the output solution is the smallest. As the maximum number of evolutions increases from 2, the output solution's evaluation value becomes more extensive, so we choose the maximum number of evolutions 2 for the simulation experiment.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different maximum numbers of evolutions on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.(4) The Influence of the End Elimination Ratio on the MSA_PABC. We select the"
"the simulation experiment.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different maximum numbers of evolutions on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.(4) The Influence of the End Elimination Ratio on the MSA_PABC. We select the different end elimination ratios 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25, the number of rescue points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and other parameters in Table1analyze the influence of different end elimination ratios the evaluation value of output solution.As shown in Figure10, the too small end elimination ratio is not conducive to eliminate the part inadequate solutions and reduce the convergence speed. And it converges to the optimal local solution within a limited number of iterations. The too large end elimination ratio will cause many solution sets to be reinitialized, thereby reducing the food source's overall quality. Therefore, under different numbers of rescue points, when the end elimination ratio is 0.2, the output solution's evaluation value is the smallest. When the end elimination ratio is less than 0.2, its evaluation value of the output solution becomes larger as the end elimination ratio decreases. When the end elimination ratio is greater than or equal to 0.2, the evaluation value of the output solution becomes larger. So we choose the end elimination ratio of 0.2 for the simulation experiment.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different end elimination ratio on the evaluation value of output solution in"

So we choose the end elimination ratio of 0.2 for the simulation experiment.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe influence of different end elimination ratio on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC.5.2.3. Algorithm Performance ComparisonIn Section5.2.2, when we choose the number of food sources 50, the crossover probability 0.2, the maximum number of evolutions 2, and the end elimination ratio 0.2, we can find the optimal solution of MSA_PABC, and the evaluation value of the output solution is the smallest. Therefore, we choose those parameters, the number of rescue points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively, the corresponding material types 4, 13, 18, 23, 40, and the parameters in Table1calculate the average maximum transportation distance, the average material satisfaction rate of rescue points, the standard deviation of maximum transportation distance, the standard deviation of satisfaction rate, and the number of earliest completed convergence iterations in MSA_PABC, ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO under 10 randomly generated different disaster scenarios. The average values are used as the simulation results.As shown in Figures11and12, no matter how the number of rescue points changes, the average maximum distance of MSA_PABC is lower than that of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO. The material satisfaction rate of MSA_PABC is larger than that of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO. That is because MSA_PABC uses the transportation distance and"
"points changes, the average maximum distance of MSA_PABC is lower than that of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO. The material satisfaction rate of MSA_PABC is larger than that of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO. That is because MSA_PABC uses the transportation distance and material satisfaction rate as the fitness parameters for calculating each rescue point and takes the optimal fitness values of multiple rescue points as a multiobjective problem. To solve the multiobjective problem, MSA_PABC uses niche technology to group the offspring in the employing bee phase. MSA_PABC also maintains the diversity of the population and improves the generation efficiency of Pareto nondominated solutions. Then, MSA_PABC uses variable neighborhood search operation and crossover operation to improve the algorithm's global search capabilities and local update capabilities and ensure the solution's quality. It uses the Pareto control strategy to avoid falling into the optimal local solution. Therefore, MSA_PABC can find the optimal solution within the maximum number of iterations of 50.Figure 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of average maximum distances.Figure 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of material satisfaction rates.As shown in Figures13and14, regardless of the number of rescue points, the standard deviation of the maximum transportation distance and material satisfaction rate of MSA_PABC are lower than those of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO.

"regardless of the number of rescue points, the standard deviation of the maximum transportation distance and material satisfaction rate of MSA_PABC are lower than those of ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO. That is because MSA_PABC solves the multiobjective problem of competition among rescue points through a modified Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm to find a nondominated set covering multiple schemes. In the nondominated location, MSA_PABC takes the standard deviation of the maximum transport distance and the material satisfaction rate as parameters of the overall evaluation value. It balances the maximum transportation distance among rescue points and the secular satisfaction rate and achieves the rescue points' fairness. However, ABC only considers the comprehensive indicators of flood control material schedule but does not consider the right among rescue points, resulting in a higher standard deviation of the maximum transportation distance and material satisfaction rate. NSGA2 and MOPSO use the Pareto strategy to solve the multiobjective problems; their standard deviations are smaller than ABC but are significantly worse when solving the high-dimensional issues, resulting in a larger standard deviation than that of MSA_PABC.Figure 13Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of standard deviation of maximum transport distances.Figure 14Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of standard deviation of material satisfaction rates.As shown in Figure15, regardless of the number"

This is because MSA_PABC uses multistrategy food source initialization in the initialization phase and uses the niche technology, variable neighborhood search operation, and crossover operation in the employed bee phase. It uses the Pareto nondominated sorting, crossover operation, and other operations in the onlooker bee phase. It uses the end elimination mechanism and evolution threshold in the scout bee phase. Therefore, MSA_PABC can find the optimal solution in a short number of iterations, and its number of the earliest completed convergence iterations is the smallest. ABC directly finds better food sources nearby to update the optimal evaluation value. Its search ability is low, and it takes a long time to converge. It is also easy to fall into the optimal local solution. Although NSGA2 and MOPSO can search and approach the Pareto boundary, their traditional crossover, mutation, and other operations have low search efficiency, resulting in slow convergence. Therefore, their numbers of earliest completed convergence iteration are higher than that of ABC.Figure 15Open in figure"

ConclusionIn the paper, we propose a multiobjective scheduling algorithm of flood control materials based on the Pareto artificial bee colony. First of all, considering the constraints, such as distance constraint from multiple storage warehouses to multiple rescue points, storage capacity constraint of warehouse materials, and material requirement constraint, we establish the scheduling optimization model of flood control materials for each disaster rescue point and the total scheduling optimization model of all flood control materials. Then, we use the modified Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm for solving the multiobjective model. That is, we propose a variety of food source initialization strategies, fitness value calculation of food sources, the employed bee operation including niche technology and variable neighborhood local search, onlooker bee operation including Pareto dominates sorting, crossover operations, and scout bee operation including maximum evolution threshold and end elimination mechanism. Through the food source initialization strategies, we obtain the nondominated solution set under the scheduling problem of"
"sorting, crossover operations, and scout bee operation including maximum evolution threshold and end elimination mechanism. Through the food source initialization strategies, we obtain the nondominated solution set under the scheduling problem of multiple disaster sites and various flood control materials and obtain an optimal solution from the nondominated solution set. Finally, we analyze the distribution of nondominated solution sets and the convergence of MSA_PABC and analyze the influence of the number of food sources, crossover probability, maximum evolution times, and end elimination ratio on the evaluation value of output solution in MSA_PABC. Finally, we compare the average maximum transportation distance, the average material satisfaction rate of rescue points, the standard deviation of maximum transportation distance, the standard deviation of satisfaction rate, and the number of earliest completed convergence iterations in MSA_PABC, ABC, NSGA2, and MOPSO.The simulation results show that no matter how many rescue points change, MSA_PABC can quickly find the nondominated sets and optimal solutions. It also improves the convergence rate and the material satisfaction rate and reduces the average maximum transport distance of flood control materials, the standard deviation of the maximum transport distance, and the standard deviation of material satisfaction rate. However, the time complexity of MSA_PABC is high, so in the future, we aim to use the heuristic algorithm"

However, the time complexity of MSA_PABC is high, so in the future, we aim to use the heuristic algorithm to solve the optimal model and find the optimal solution, which reduces the calculation time of the algorithm.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Public Welfare Technology Application and Research Projects of Zhejiang Province of China under Grant No. LGF19F010006 and Grant No. LGG20F010009, the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province of China under Grant No. LQ18F030006, and the Project Intelligentization and Digitization for Airline Revolution #2018R02008.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings are available upon the authors' reasonable request.References1Wang W.,Yang J.,Huang L.,Proverbs D., andWei J.,Intelligent storage location allocation with multiple objectives for Flood control materials,Water.

This paper focusses on city management based on the smart information system and digital technologies in China. The establishment of the smart intercommunication system of landscape, water conservancy, environmental protection and other industries is basic for a smart city. This paper introduced a framework of digital technologies for the construction of a smart city, which made full use of the city information modelling based on the geographic information system, building information modelling, internet of things, and integrated digital system and service platform such as satellite remote sensing, global navigation satellite system, mobile applications, cloud computing, visualisation technology etc. The study of the case implemented show that the framework is applicable to the smart city with digital technologies that includes the data model and system, integrating the urban basic geographic data, and data of infrastructure and other public facilities related to traffic, urban construction, 'One Map' of land and resources etc. The governance is more effective through data acquisition, data transmission, data analysis and processing based on the data platform and system.1 INTRODUCTIONOver half of the world's population resides in urban areas at present.

"and processing based on the data platform and system.1 INTRODUCTIONOver half of the world's population resides in urban areas at present. It is projected that more than two-thirds of people around the world will live in cities by 2050 [1]. China's economic and social development is accompanied by urbanisation. The pressure brought about by the increase in population to the management of information, transportation, environment, resources and security has caused some difficulties to the development of cities and towns [2,3]. Some countries have strategically designed the top-level design of smart cities. For example, Seoul has released the 'Smart Seoul 2015' plan. Amsterdam in Netherlands hopes to use the 'Smart City' (Amsterdam Smart City; ASC) to improve living standard of the public and create new employment opportunities [4]. The Smart City is a new model that strengthens urban planning, construction and management by comprehensively applying modern science and technology, integrating information resources, and coordinating business application systems [5-7]. In order to explore a scientific way of building, operating, managing, serving and developing smart cities, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction of the People's Republic of China has initiated a number of pilot projects in smart cities in 2012.

One of the important technologies for smart cities is dynamic digital twin technology which commonly used to simulate, monitor and control, for example, manufacturing processes and facilities [9]. How to make full use of the built urban digital twin achievements to serve urban governance and citizens is the direction of future efforts. For urban governance and citizen services based on digital twin data, the cyber physical connections should be considered, including the application of digital twin brothers that directly affect products or manufacturing assets, and enable real-time remote control of physical objects [9]. In the process of developing a smart city, it is necessary to rely on the support of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). It is also important to use the internet to realise the efficient analysis and intelligent processing of urban management [4].Based on the developing direction of smart cities in China and the existing technical conditions, this paper"
"Technology (ICT). It is also important to use the internet to realise the efficient analysis and intelligent processing of urban management [4].Based on the developing direction of smart cities in China and the existing technical conditions, this paper proposes the realisation path of smart city construction and the application of relevant new technologies. The framework for smart city construction, city information modelling (CIM) and digital governance is proposed, within which geographic information system (GIS), building information modelling (BIM), internet of things (IoT), satellite remote sensing (SRS), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), 'One Map' of land and resources, mobile applications, cloud computing, visualisation technology etc. are integrated. The technical feasibility of the framework has been validated with the actual cases implemented in China.2 THE FRAMEWORK OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR SMART CITYTo achieve the effective integration and full utilisation of information resources, it is necessary to build CIM for multi-industry and multi-department management, accelerate the informatisation and intellectualised construction of the urban system, and promote new models of urban planning, construction, social management and services, and enhance the ability of sustainable urban development.

CIM is based on BIM, GIS, IoT and other technologies, supporting the process of urban planning, construction, management, and operation, and building a city with a three-dimensional digital space Information organic complex. The framework for using smart intercommunication system of multi-industry, multi-department management is shown in Figure1. Urban planning refers to the specific arrangements and implementation measures for the economic and social development, land use, spatial layout, and various construction of a city in a certain period. Urban construction is the transformation of an urban living environment through construction projects and the construction of various material facilities in the urban system. Urban management and services refers to the management of all urban activities, including political, economic, social and municipal management.FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe framework for using smart intercommunication system of multi-industry, multi-department managementThe level of urban management service is an important symbol and direct manifestation of the civilisation and comprehensive strength of a region [10].

"[10]. To build a complex giant system that corresponds, maps and interacts with the physical urban world and form a virtual digital twin city, 'One Map' was built and reflected the real world by using RS, GIS and GNSS. Under the premise of formulating and implementing unified map data specifications and map service specifications, the GIS cloud service platform provided cloud services for aerospace remote sensing image maps, topographic maps, electronic maps and other geographic information data. A mechanism for the co-construction, sharing and exchange of information resources with government departments such as planning, construction, gardening, water conservancy, and transportation has been established. At the same time, a multi-industry and multi-department intelligent business information management system serving government management, enterprises and public life has been constructed. Without reasonable planning, there will be no healthy and orderly construction and management of the city. In order to make scientific compilation, approval and monitoring of urban planning, and to provide the blueprint for finishing, on the basis of effective integration of urban planning management information, the unified, complete and standardised comprehensive database of planning a one map system was established. Furthermore, its subsystems of planning results, planning approval, planning supervision were established, respectively. Based on the models of urban traffic analysis,"
"and standardised comprehensive database of planning a one map system was established. Furthermore, its subsystems of planning results, planning approval, planning supervision were established, respectively. Based on the models of urban traffic analysis, urban population analysis, and urban land use analysis, the big data and artificial intelligence technology were used to construct a big data analysis system of planning. The big data analysis system of planning improved the efficiency of city planning management and provided technical support for urban government decision-making. Urban social management and services are important functions of the government, for the government supervision and management of the construction process after the approval of the city planning, the subsystems of quality supervision, safety supervision, environmental supervision, real-name management and the collaborative supervision system of construction engineering have been established, respectively. The uses of video monitoring equipment, dust and noise monitoring equipment, face recognition equipment, intelligent safety helmet and other equipment deployed in the construction site have strengthened the informatisation supervision of construction project quality, safety, environment and personnel.

"project quality, safety, environment and personnel. It not only promoted green and civilised construction but also created a good order of a construction market.The urban grid management model has been widely used in China. It divides the urban space into grids according to a certain scope, relying on information technology and collaborative work mode. It realises the unified and collaborative management of various resources and management objects of urban social management in grid cells, and the coordinated scheduling and sharing of resources among different grids. The grid method is necessary for effective digital city governance. The main process of digital city governance includes case collection, registration, dispatching, processing, feedback and final checking. The comprehensive information platform integrates the management elements of 'people, land, things, feelings, cases and organisations'. It promotes the transformation of social management from 'extensive management' to 'fine management' and the transformation of serving the public from 'decentralised service' to 'one-stop service'.In addition to planning, construction, urban management and services, the management system of smart cities also has integrated smart information subsystems such as smart gardening, smart water conservancy, smart environmental protection, and smart railways in combination with the management of different industries.The realisation of smart cities requires the basic platform of CIM"

"Geospatial data databaseAs a framework of urban information resources integration, information resources sharing and application model based on 'one map' has unique advantages. In this way, the urban geospatial data can be integrated with the professional data of various departments. The effective integration of regional information resources can be achieved and allow for the delivery of visualised decision-making process and data sharing services to the government. Developing the application of government affairs and public services on the 'One Map' can avoid duplication of construction and waste of funds. The economic and social benefits of the investment can be maximised.

"AbstractWith the rapid development of science and technology, the global network and informatization process is changing people's lives, and it has also brought profound changes to the management of enterprises. Traditional management still relies heavily on offline management and paper delivery of information. The traditional management model in the past cannot meet the needs of the continuous development of enterprises. The purpose of this article is to design a high-skilled talent information management system to meet the needs of users and enterprises. This paper combines the BP multisensor information fusion algorithm to screen and process the data and designs a multisensor information fusion-based competency evaluation model for highly skilled talents. A high-skilled talent information management system has been established with modules such as basic personnel information, skills identification information, high-skilled talent management, competence, key research teams, common reports, comprehensive query, and system maintenance. In the test of the system's usability, 156 users rated the system above 3 points, accounting for 78% of the survey population, indicating that the system has a certain ease of use. This system realizes the electronicization of the basic information of skilled personnel, which plays an important role in regulating the professional management of skilled personnel and improving the management efficiency of skilled personnel.1.

IntroductionWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, informatization construction and paperless office have become the signs of the modern office. The application of multisensor information fusion in robotics makes people pay more and more attention to the development of artificial intelligence. With the development of computer technology and management science, information management systems have emerged, which has greatly improved the quality and effectiveness of management and decision-making. The information technology of the international developed countries has been produced relatively early, has always occupied a leading position, and occupied a certain Chinese market. Although the domestic information technology started late, it is also developing rapidly.

The realization of a high-skilled talent information management system can provide enterprises with powerful intellectual resources, enable enterprises to better grasp, and reasonably allocate information on high-skilled talent resources, so that these talents can make full use of them [3]. As the enterprise continues to develop, the function of the information management system needs to be able to meet the changing needs of the enterprise, and it must have strong adaptability and scalability. Can draw on the application of multisensor information fusion in robot technology, design artificial intelligence network-based high-skilled talents information management system, to achieve professional management of standardized skilled talents, and improve the management efficiency of skilled talents [4,5].Chettibi's team used multisensor information fusion to develop an intelligent power management system that will automatically control load shedding in local power distribution areas and utilize different types of generator sets such as conventional and unconventional energy sources. If the power generation is insufficient to meet the load demand, the multisensor information fusion will predict and predict when the load demand is greater than the power"
"types of generator sets such as conventional and unconventional energy sources. If the power generation is insufficient to meet the load demand, the multisensor information fusion will predict and predict when the load demand is greater than the power generation amount and specifically propose a suitable load reduction area. Utilizing and processing different types of seasonal and occasional loading data, they designed multisensor information fusion to automatically show them that local power restrictions would be better based on priority. Therefore, the area that needs to minimize the load is a priority [6]. Peng's team established the development of an information database and information data management system to facilitate the multisource, multidisciplinary data generated by the data management work in the geological repository in China during the site selection process. Through this management system, basic functions such as creation, retrieval, update, deletion, full-text retrieval, and download can be realized. It can even provide some professional data statistics and analysis functions. Finally, data from many different disciplines was successfully integrated, stored, and managed. At the same time, the management system can also provide an important reference for data management in related research fields such as decommissioning and management of nuclear facilities, resource exploration, and environmental protection [7].

"can also provide an important reference for data management in related research fields such as decommissioning and management of nuclear facilities, resource exploration, and environmental protection [7]. Yue's team has developed an air pollution and health impact monitoring information system that includes data collection, data management, data quality control, statistics, and visual display. Through the B/S architecture, the design concept of separation of authority management from professional applications and centralized data management, authority process management, and quality control is integrated into the entire process of data collection, data processing, data review, and statistics. Key functions such as data collection, three-level auditing, statistics, visual display, and system management of the information system were realized. The system has been applied in national projects in 31 provinces, 65 cities, and 126 monitoring points. So far, more than 16 million business records have been stored in the system, and the amount of data has reached more than 10 g. It not only meets the monitoring requirements but also provides basic support for research and decision-making [8].This article designs a high-skilled talent information management system to meet the needs of users and enterprises. This paper combines the BP multisensor information fusion algorithm to screen and process the data and designs a multisensor information fusion-based competency evaluation model"
