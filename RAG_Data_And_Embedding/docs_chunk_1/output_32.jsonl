"structure of SOA was simple with high flexibility, and it was widely applied [16]. However, no specialized development language provides technical support for SOA at present. Many scholars combine Java technology with SOA technology to realize information system distribution [17]. Java2 platform enterprise edition (J2EE) of Java could be used to implement Web service to provide better scalability for the system. In addition, it could reduce the coupling between the system and modules more effectively.In the new stage, the scale of hospitals expands continuously and the number of medical staff increases constantly, which causes some pressures to human resource management. Based on artificial management, traditional methods show low management efficiency, high management costs, and frequent errors. In addition, it is difficult for patients to access information and inconvenient to share information. The utilization of AI technology to actively promote the analysis of medical data and improve its quality and efficiency becomes an urgent problem to be dealt with. Hence, hospital human resource management system was constructed based on AI to the efficiency of hospital human resource management and reduce human resource management cost. Based on the precise and comprehensive development of SOA and functional requirements, a simple and quick interface was provided for users, which provided the reference for the design and development of human resource information management"

Based on the precise and comprehensive development of SOA and functional requirements, a simple and quick interface was provided for users, which provided the reference for the design and development of human resource information management system.2. Data and Methods2.1. Hospital Human Resource Management SystemThe hospital human resource management system needs to meet many aspects. General data mainly includes employee transfer management, employee compensation information management, employee basic information management, and employee attendance information management. The design of the management system should not only meet the information sharing of internal personnel but also needs to ensure that extranet management system can access the data in human resource management statistics. The data visualization in the system should better understand and interpret data to enable people to find hidden laws from the seemly chaotic massive data and to provide reference for scientific findings. The overall structure of hospital human resource system is shown in Figure1below. The data and resource-related services related to human resource is provided for hospital staff and leaders through hospital local area network (LAN).

SOA TechnologyThe main atoms of SOA design include the following contents:(a)Explicit interface definition that the interface is stable as well as unambiguous and shows encapsulation(b)Self-contained and modularized: the functional entity that implements services is completely independent and autonomous. It can perform deployment, version control, and self-management as well as recovery(c)Coarse grain: the number of services should not be excessive. The services rely on message interaction rather than remote procedure call(d)Loose coupling: the interdependency and imaging between services, the location of service, implementation techniques, current status, and private data are reduced. The services are invisible to service requests. Interoperability, compatibility, and policy statement are also reducedFigure2illustrated the SOA design principles below.Open in figure viewerPowerPointSOA is oriented to the integration and development of the model.

The services in the SOA architecture mainly embody the upgrading of functions and realize the concreteness of application front-end functions. The contract carries on the function realization, and the interface is a part of the contract, realizing concrete description of the server realization end to the application degree. The service library is used to realize the execution of independent management and service storage. The requirements of service bus must meet connectivity, technical heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity, and technical service (Figure3).Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.3. Support of SOA by J2EEAll major development languages on the market adapt to the support from SOA. Java is featured with \"written once, run everywhere,\" which meets the requirement of cross-platform operation. The combination of SOA and Java can realize the offline problem of distributed information system. J2EE platform of Java is selected to provide services for Web, which can better achieve the repeatability and extensibility of functions and reduce the coupling between systems and between modules. J2EE focuses on realizing the service support of Web by XML language, which can better achieve SOA and reduce the work intensity of developers.

"support of Web by XML language, which can better achieve SOA and reduce the work intensity of developers. Main J2EE office automation-based steps include information collection, information processing, information transmission, and information saving, as demonstrated in Figure4below. The main levels include the transactional level, decision-making level, and management level. Automated office equipment can make use of advanced communication techniques to collect, sort out, process, save, and use information extensively, comprehensively, and rapidly. The advantage of J2EE lies in the use of user interface and enterprise business logic to open with system services in which a series of bottom-level services such as buffer pool and business management are provided. Consequently, developers focus on the business logic of enterprises. The overall complete architecture of J2EE can simplify system solution and consolidate the original advantages of Java standard version. The whole constructed system can significantly reduce the time of delivery to market.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.4.

The construction of the system needs to meet both functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements. The analysis of performance requirements needs to be evaluated from two perspectives, including implementation approach and implementation efficiency. The construction of human resource management system includes the humanization of the main system interface, high processing speed and efficiency of the system, high safety and reliability of the system, the confidentiality and security check mechanisms required by hospital human resource management, the maximum utilization of official free hardware resources and networks, and the reduction of unnecessary system costs.

Performance TestPerformance test was implemented to guarantee the safety, reliability, and execution efficiency of system operation, mainly including link speed test, pressure test, and load test. The connection speed test was performed to test the speed of the connection to application system by users. Too low response speed resulted in the timeout limit on page. Too low connection speed might cause data loss. Besides, users could not get real pages without good experience. Pressure test focused on system limits and the capacity of fault restoration. In other words, the circumstance under which the system crash occurred was tested. If a hacker provided a wrong data load, the system crash occurred. Access right was gained when the system was restarted. Load test was carried out in a reagent network environment. The system allowed a certain number of users to be online at the same time at a certain load level. What would happen when the number of users was exceeded was tested. The system received load test, which ensured that the result was correct and reliable.The number of parallel connections was set. Under concurrent connections, parallel connection was set.

In other words, it referred to the simulation of the links of a certain number of clients. According to the loading capacity of the machine, threads were set. In most cases, 200 to 1,000 threads were set. Mock clients were selected within this range. If there were 300 users at a time, the growth of the number of users during the period was analyzed. It was estimated that there were 40 online users, the maximum number of concurrent online users was 10 times, and the maximum number of concurrent online users was 40∗10. Besides, the performance or page response index was analyzed.3. Results3.1.

DiscussionAI can work at any time with sufficient energy support. It shows excellent computing power, which enables it to perform thousands of calculations within a few seconds. Computer network mitigation is complex with huge information amount and difficult manual management methods. AI intelligent computing can be utilized to complete information analysis in a short time. Besides, AI can take advantage of advanced programs for information classification as well as automatic and rapid storage and deletion of relevant information. AI can learn and mimic human features and enters a fully restored action with the correct programming [18-20]. The human resource management system is a reasonable allocation of hospital human resources and the scientific management of the automatic calculation of yuan wage, labor insurance, and rewards as well as punishments. The timely and accurate acquisition of personnel-related information and data is realized, and the required reports can be obtained according to different requirements [21,22].

"according to different requirements [21,22]. Client-server application is always adopted as the system architecture of the existing human resource management system. However, the maintenance of the architecture is complex and its tolerance is poor. In addition, the development of the system is difficult with low data security. Many scholars utilized ongoing J2EE to design system architecture for system development and maintenance. Wang et al. [23] adopted the overall architecture Java2 platform J2EE multilayer structure. The interface of the designed human resource management system was simple and comprehensible. The system was operatable with high security. The average response time of business end was shorter than 0.4 seconds. Memory control is below 30%. The designed system was suitable for personnel management. The functionality analysis was performed on the requirements of human resource management to provide the guarantee for the construction and application of hospital human resource management. The constructed system demonstrated high processing speed, security, reliability, and certain fault tolerance. Therefore, it can meet the demands of the hospital human resource management.The SOA architecture enables integration of existing heterogeneous systems at minimal cost [24].

"of existing heterogeneous systems at minimal cost [24]. Based on the above design principles, the overall system was designed using J2EE and established on Java platform. The designed system could not only consolidate the advantages of Java standard edition but also facilitate data storage and retrieval. J2EE offered comprehensive techniques, including xml, ejb, and jsp. All techniques can get good support. By unifying development platforms, J2EE could reduce the costs during the development of multilayer applications. Besides, it could support the existing application programs very well. The performance was enhanced, and security mechanism was implemented. The four-layer model of J2EE consisted of a client-layer component, Web-layer component, business logic layer component, and enterprise information system layer component. In the context of AI intelligence, bottom-level data were automatically accessed. The console of the server could be utilized to implement the deployment of various applications [25]. With the continuous and rapid expansion of hospital scale, it is dispensable to investigate intelligent management mode by combining mainstream informatization.

In addition, the successful design of hospital human resource information system is conducive to the effective management of employee and patient information and the improvement of work efficiency of hospitals. The design of information system is never the focus. The design of considerable scholars needs to be updated and upgraded constantly. The human resource management system designed based on SOA in an intelligent way showed high security and good system performance.5. ConclusionBased on the context of AI, J2EE was combined with Java to carry out the design and research on hospital human resource information management system. In addition, the functions and performances required by the system were analyzed. Based on the analysis of the system, the feasible design was proposed. The results revealed that the constructed system could run normally and could achieve the efficiency of hospital human resource management. The constructed system effectively improved the querying and sharing of human resource information and provided the reference for the decision-making system of hospital leaders. Nonetheless, there were still some limitations in the system. For instance, patients could not implement custom query and print out what they needed.

Information management has become the most practical and effective method and means in performing arts training management, but as the amount of various data grows exponentially, the requirements for computing processing power and speed for massive amounts of data and information are also increasing day by day.

IntroductionWith the continuous advancement of science and technology, as well as the development of the art of dance and the education of dance itself, the scientific training of dance has gradually gained the attention of all dance educators. In modern performing arts, information technology has widely penetrated into training management, daily management, health management, and other aspects, making dance training more efficient and effective. In recent years, various sports smart APPs have continued to rise. Users only need to open the APP to perform various sports such as running, fitness, dancing, and learning martial arts through the APP. In addition, during the exercise, the sports APP can accurately record the user′s exercise time and calories burned and then perform effective evaluation, give targeted exercise suggestions, and specifically provide users with various sports service needs.

Design exercises such as fitness, running, and professional training are according to the needs of users. Therefore, designing a scientific and effective dance training information management system combined with a smart APP can make the management of dance training more informationized, systematic, and efficient, thereby changing the status quo of dance training and playing a major role in further improving the level of modern performing arts. The data information generated by the mobile information management system for dance training is sent to each cloud platform through the network, and the analysis results are obtained through the central function. However, due to the widespread use of distributed intelligent devices, a large amount of data transmission blocks the transmission channel. There are many difficulties in using cloud computing technology to solve this problem, and the latest computing technology provides an effective method to solve this problem.

"training effects. It emphasizes the role of smart APP in dance training and achieves the best training management effect with minimal investment.Services based on the Internet of Things benefit from cloud services. Yang L. uses edge computing to study computing offloading, delivering computing to a new paradigm at the edge of popular networks near mobile users. In order to stimulate cloud service operators and local edge server owners to participate in computing offloading, he formulates the interaction between cloud service operators and edge server owners as a Stackelberg game to maximize cloud service operations by obtaining the best payment and fees The utility of the business and edge server owners: however, his research cannot satisfy more complex applications, and further research is needed [1]. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can be freed from computationally intensive workloads by offloading mobile devices to nearby MEC servers. In order for offloading to be effective, radio and computing resources need to be dynamically managed to cope with time-varying computing requirements and wireless fading channels. Mao has developed an online joint radio and computing resource management algorithm for multiuser MEC systems. Its goal is to minimize the long-term average weighting and power consumption of mobile devices and MEC servers under the effect of task buffers.

"goal is to minimize the long-term average weighting and power consumption of mobile devices and MEC servers under the effect of task buffers. Stability constraints: specifically, in each time slot, the optimal CPU cycle frequency of the mobile device is obtained in a closed form, and the optimal transmit power and bandwidth allocation for calculating offloading are determined by the Gauss-Seidel method. For the MEC server, the optimal frequency of the CPU core and the optimal MEC server scheduling decision are derived in a closed form. But it did not consider that this algorithm is too complicated, which may cause a higher load on the equipment during operation [2]. The advent of the Internet of Things and 5G applications requires the integration of centralized cloud computing and emerging mobile edge computing (MEC) with existing network infrastructure to enhance storage, processing, and caching functions not only in a centralized manner but also in a distributed manner. Achieve the following goals: support both delayed and mission-critical applications at the same time. Rimal studied the performance improvement of centralized cloud and MEC-enabled integrated optical fiber wireless (FiWi) access network.

"management solution is proposed, which combines centralized cloud computing and MEC computing offloading activities into the underlying FiWi dynamic bandwidth allocation process. By using time division multiple access, both MEC and cloud traffic are arranged outside the transmission time slot of FiWi traffic. An analysis framework was developed to model the packet delay, response time efficiency, gain-offload cost ratio, and communication-to-computation ratio of cloud and broadband access traffic. But his research is not supported by actual data, and a lot of experiments are needed to verify the feasibility of the theory [3].The innovation of this paper is as follows: (1) reducing the data transmission delay of the edge network through the designed algorithm, using the abnormal data recognition algorithm to identify abnormal data, improving the computing efficiency of edge computing, and reducing the cost of edge server deployment; (2) adopting an open platform integrating network, computing, storage, and application core capabilities, services provided at close distances, and their applications starting from the edge, making network services more responsive and satisfying real-time processing, smart applications, and basic industry needs such as security and privacy.2.

Services are provided at close range, and its applications start from the edge, making network services more responsive, and meet the basic industry needs of real-time processing, smart applications, security, and privacy [4]. Mobile edge computing technology provides mobile users with the wireless network computing and cloud functions, localizes application services that require a lot of computing resources, and deploys them to nearby mobile users, thereby reducing wireless network delays and high bandwidth transmission capabilities. In addition, reducing backhaul bandwidth requirements can greatly reduce operating costs. Edge computing is located between physical entities and industrial connections, or on top of physical entities [5,6]. In addition, cloud computing can continue to access edge data on edge computers [7,8]. Since the introduction of cloud computing, although it has brought convenience to people′s lives and work, the development of the Internet of Things and the increase in data volume have revealed the drawbacks of cloud computing.

"of the Internet of Things and the increase in data volume have revealed the drawbacks of cloud computing. People began to explore new data processing methods to solve the disadvantages of cloud computing. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) was proposed [9,10]. The definition of cloud computing is that a mobile device delivers computing unit storage, operating platforms, other resources, or information service resources, or information service delivery communication networks from the cloud center over the mobile device on demand. This is the combined product of the mobile communication network [11]. Mobile devices connect to the cloud hub over a wireless network and send their own tasks to the cloud hub. There is no need to perform data management calculations or other processing [12], just provide data input and output in the cloud center. This feature allows users to download and install applications, store mobile storage memory, view data on a variety of devices and platforms, improve application compatibility, and cover mobile devices [13,14]. Edge computing refers to the \"sinking\" of cloud computing functions at the network edge, which is a new type of computer model used with network edge devices. The \"end\" of edge computing is the data source generated by the end of the network terminal [15,16]. For the resources between the data paths in the cloud data center, the basic idea is to perform computer work on the computer resources near the data source. Edge computing and cloud"
"is the data source generated by the end of the network terminal [15,16]. For the resources between the data paths in the cloud data center, the basic idea is to perform computer work on the computer resources near the data source. Edge computing and cloud computing are complementary to each other [17,18]. The portable computing chip is a computing chip. The traditional wireless access network is located between the wireless access point and the wired network, which can provide end users with higher bandwidth and waiting for data service, which can save time and reduce bandwidth, data service requirements for network search [19]. Although mobile edge computing technology is very convenient, it faces many challenges when applied to real network scenarios. First, a large number of network access points (APs) need to be developed to allow almost all smart electronic devices to access the Internet [20]. However, compared to these APs, the number of edge servers is very limited considering the deployment cost. How to optimize these low-tech servers to develop a modern network with a large number of APs is a major challenge. Mobile edge computing technology provides mobile users with a wealth of application services by migrating service resources from remote cloud computing centers to edge networks.

This can significantly eliminate the network during the data transmission process provided by the Remote Cloud Computing Center. Time delay: the innovation of this paper is to reduce the data transmission delay of the edge network through the designed algorithm, use the abnormal data recognition algorithm to identify abnormal data, improve the computing efficiency of edge computing, and reduce the cost of edge server deployment.2.2. Calculation of Transmission Delay of Edge NetworkIn order to ensure that a large number of mobile devices can access the edge network to obtain services at any time during the movement, a large number of APs need to be deployed. The transmission delay of requesting data from these APs to the edge server will greatly affect the edge server. Quality of service: if the data load needs to be transmitted on the switch through which the data transmission path passes is too large, it will cause a very serious delay in the edge network [21,22]. For different types of application services, the request data for resource requirements are also diversified.The variablerepresents the average transmission delay of the request data of the application servicenon the linkti.

"the sum of the number of mobile devices covered by each edge server to be equal toMand to ensure that no requests sent by mobile devices are repeatedly counted, then(6)2.3. Abnormal Data Recognition AlgorithmWhen collecting data, the monitored object sometimes performs some more intense behaviors [23,24]. The effect of these behaviors and actions on the data is the rapid change of the acceleration or angular velocity. Therefore, this type of data is often affected. Think of it as abnormal data [25,26]. For the identification and processing of abnormal data, taking into account the timeliness of environmental data and the limitation of processor performance, when running filling data on edge devices, it is simple and accurate to use the latest hot card filling and then perform according to the known node data. According to the filling result, insert the function s(t), and then use the interpolation function to quickly obtain the initial running data of the corresponding position. The mathematical expression is to take the number of interpolation nodes on the original function m (n) as x+1, which are (m0,n0), (m1,n1), (m2,n2), ..., (mx,nx) and substitute the following formula:(7)The following is also available:(8)After calculating the nearest points from the missing data through the above formula and substituting them into the above expression, the corresponding polynomial can be obtained.

The point N corresponding to the specified value of the function is then replaced by the interpolating polynomial to get an approximation of the missing value.2.4. Edge Network Task Load CalculationOn the MEC server side, the computing resources of the server are also limited [27]; that is, the MEC server can only meet the computing requirements of certain data at the same time. In this article, we assume that the MEC server can only perform one computing task at a time. After the MEC server completes the calculation task, it returns the calculation result to the mobile user.Assuming that the SV unit can only upload the data of one calculation task to the MEC server at the same time and the transmission power of the SV unit is expressed asGsv, then the transmission rate can be expressed as(9)Among them,t0is the energy loss constant,xis the energy loss index,kis the distance between the mobile device and the MEC server, andμrepresents the bandwidth of the system.According to the energy consumption and time required for the execution of computing tasks on the local CPU and MEC server, these data can be used by combining the two factors of energy consumption and delay into one factor, and the load can meet the individual needs of different users and flexibly adjust related influencing factors [28].Calculate the"

The two coefficients satisfy the following relationship:(13)Whenλsis larger, it means that the delay of the calculation task is larger, and whenλtis larger, it means that the user's energy consumption is too high at this time. In order to reduce the energy consumption of the calculation task, a weight coefficient can be selected.In this way, our goal is to optimize loadX:(14)2.5. Service Configuration Cost CalculationThe cost of application service configuration refers to the resource requirements for configuring VRC on the edge server to control the state synchronization between VRCs of the same application service [29,30].This cost is defined as a quadratic functionϕ·x· |n| containing the total number of VRC services and the number of all application services, whereϕis an indicator coefficient between 0 and 1.

Design of the Dance Training Mobile Information Management System Based on Edge Computing3.1. Architecture Design Based on the Edge Computing SystemAccording to the characteristics of edge computing, it is necessary to use edge devices and cloud computing centers to coordinate the realization of the overall system functions. Traditional cloud computing requires data to reach remote cloud servers through wireless access and a central network. After processing the data, the cloud server returns the result to the user through a long-distance backhaul connection. It can be seen that this method of operation is very time-consuming. As one of the basic infrastructures of today's 5G network technology, the edge computing network is mainly developed through distributed portable service nodes to provide these nodes with computing and storage resources for terminals to process user requests and make full use of them to make the network have low latency and high scalability.Figure1shows the basic schematic diagram of a mobile edge computing system.

"requests and make full use of them to make the network have low latency and high scalability.Figure1shows the basic schematic diagram of a mobile edge computing system. On the MEC platform, the edge server is located on the side of the wireless access network, which greatly shortens the distance from the user equipment. Due to the shortened transmission distance, the MEC task no longer requires long-distance backhaul connections and core networks, which can generally reduce delay. On the other hand, the computing functions of edge servers are much more powerful than mobile devices, which significantly reduces task processing time. The design idea of the portable computing system can not only meet the needs of portable terminal equipment to expand the computer capacity but also make up for the long transmission delay of the cloud computing platform. Mobile edge computing service nodes are the core of the entire network, and developers develop many computing and storage resources on these nodes. Real-time services can be provided when a request is received, thereby saving basic computing network resources.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBasic framework diagram of mobile edge computing system.3.2.

"Training Mobile Information Management System3.2.1. System Structure DesignThe dance training management information system is a comprehensive management system for multilevel users. It has high requirements for the relevance and real-time performance of each link. Therefore, it is necessary to use a computer network system as a platform for construction. The main body of sports training management is information. This information includes all the information generated by the interaction or interrelation of each link in sports training management; they are the bond of each link. The transmission of information in various links is the key to information management, and the role of the management information system is to make the transmission of information more timely and accurate. Therefore, using the management information system as a tool to conduct sports training management is the development direction of modern sports management. Through demand analysis, the dance training management information system is divided into four modules: user management module, training plan management module, training effect management module, and body information management module as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointFramework diagram of dance training mobile information management system.3.3.

"diagram of dance training mobile information management system.3.3. MySQL-Based Data Storage ModuleData management is the process of using computer hardware and software technology to effectively collect, store, process, and apply data. In the process of system operation, a large amount of data needs to be processed, and the database can access and process data reasonably and efficiently. Among them, MySQL is popular among small- and medium-sized websites due to its small size, fast speed, and low cost. This module will also choose it as a data storage tool. When storing data, because the system uses multiple edge devices to transmit data to the cloud computing center at the same time, the data transmission speed will be very fast in the actual operation process. When requesting, the phenomenon of task jam will inevitably occur. This article calls the database connection pool under the MySQL software system, stores the requests for data storage tasks in the connection pool in a certain order, and calls them sequentially, thereby alleviating the phenomenon of task blocking.After the database connection is established through Figure3, when the database server receives the database execution message uploaded by the WEB, the message is analyzed.

"system architecture, for the transmission delay of end-to-end data transmission, the submission time is generally used to verify the time interval from one device to another for submitting data. As shown in the mobile edge network architecture based on SDN technology, this paper uses a Python program to develop a simulation environment to simulate the impact of different configurations of VRC supporting multiple application services in the edge network on the service request response delay of each application. This article analyzes the network transmission delay by comparing the four algorithms: EOESPA, RNOESPA, KMCA, and RESPA. In order to further study how the limited edge server access delay affects the maximum reliability of the SDN-based edge network, the edge network service deployment plan is represented by four algorithms, as shown in Table1.Table  1.Edge network server deployment plan.AlgorithmComputation complexityEOESPAO (K2⋅|V|⋅CK)RNOESPAO (|V|2+|E|⋅|V|)KMCAO (K3⋅|V|2⋅t)RESPA0(1)As shown in Figure5, it can be observed that, for each average service request data size setting, the average access delay achieved by the deployment scheme proposed by RNOESPA is very close to the best performance that EOESPA can achieve and is even worse than the classic KMCA.

Moreover, regardless of the amount of data transmitted, the average delivery time is below 2 ms, and with the increase of data, the delivery time will not change much, which can better ensure the real-time nature of data transmission.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe impact of the average request data volume on the minimum access delay of edge servers.As shown in Figure6, as the number of mobile devices in the edge network increases, the edge server deployment solution proposed by RNOESPA can also achieve better performance than KMCA. In addition, from the experimental results shown in Figures5and6, it can be seen that the edge server access delay caused by the deployment schemes proposed by all four algorithms increases with the size of the service request data and the growth of the number of mobile devices. At the same time, the experimental results also show that the increase in the number of mobile devices has less impact on the access latency of the edge server than the increase in the size of the service request data.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe impact of the number of mobile devices on the minimum latency of edge servers.In order to avoid data transmission disorder when the system architecture is sending data, the stability of PAG data upload and the stability of PAG received data are analyzed.

As shown in Tables2and3, the delay number is that the response is not received immediately but received after a few responses. It can be seen from the results that with the increase of data sent per second, there is no packet loss in data upload, and the stability of data upload is better. At the same time, although there is a delay in receiving data when data is received, there is no packet loss, which can be determined. The stability of data acquisition is good.Table  2.Data upload result.Type of dataNumber of packets sent per secondDelay numberPacket loss rateData upload100050001000050000Table  3.Data reception result.Type of dataNumber of packets sent per secondDelay numberPacket loss rateData reception10000500401000601500904.2.

Edge Network Task Load CalculationFigure7shows the overall load of the system in different scenarios when the number of users is different. It can be seen from the figure that the local execution method has the largest overall system load, while the other solutions reduce the overall load of the system compared to the local execution method, indicating that the execution of tasks on the cloud can obviously bring benefits to users. Among the remaining methods, the system load optimization method proposed in this chapter has the lowest overall system load, and the performance improvement effect is obvious. Compared with execution on the cloud, because execution on the cloud transmits all tasks to the cloud for execution without taking into account the mutual influence of users, the performance cannot be effectively improved.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe average overall load of the system under different schemes.Figure8shows the change in task load of each method under different task numbers.

"under different task numbers. Likewise, the local execution method has the highest load. Like the previous analysis, when the number of tasks is less than a certain amount, the cloud execution method and the edge execution method have similar loads. However, as the number of tasks continues to increase, the edge execution method has a higher load than the cloud execution method due to the impact of delay, which also illustrates the important role of system load optimization in mobile edge computing.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem task load changes under different task numbers.4.4. Calculation and Analysis of Total Cost of Service ConfigurationA good application configuration scheme not only ensures a low average response delay for service requests but also needs to consider the cost of providing service configuration in the edge network. This chapter further analyzes the optimization performance of the application configuration schemes proposed by all algorithms in terms of service configuration cost.Since the VRC configuration cost is a quadratic function of the number of VRCs supporting each application and the number of application types, it will increase rapidly as the number of application types increases. It can be seen from Figure9that when the number of VRCs is small, the total cost of the service configuration scheme proposed by all algorithms decreases with the increase of the number of VRCs. This is because when the number of VRCs is very small, the"

This is because when the number of VRCs is very small, the leading service configuration cost is the request response delay, cost.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe impact of different quantities on the total cost of service configuration.5. ConclusionsBased on the mobile edge computing architecture, this paper proposes an edge network service model that provides application services for mobile users. It not only analyzes the optimal deployment of edge servers and proposes corresponding solutions, but also studies a variety of modes in which edge network resources are limited. The problem of optimal configuration of application services in the edge network and corresponding solutions are proposed. A data collection and processing system based on edge computing is realized. Through the coordination and interaction between edge devices and cloud computing center the problems of the original system such as slow computing speed, large network delay, and large load are solved. The system fully integrates the latest information technology into the information collection of the dance training smart APP, so that users can use advanced methods such as the Internet to store ideas and promote the information and automation of dance training management and its efficiency and efficiency,"
"into the information collection of the dance training smart APP, so that users can use advanced methods such as the Internet to store ideas and promote the information and automation of dance training management and its efficiency and efficiency, thereby helping to improve training level. The mobile information management system designed in this article still has shortcomings. It does not include all the content in the scope of dance training management. It only focuses on the selection of training plan management in training management as the core function of the system. Other aspects are only slightly involved and not in depth. To carry out a comprehensive functional design, further research is still needed.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Project of Hunan Provincial Social Science Achievement Review Committee, China (Grant no.

"AbstractThe Anza-Cahuilla groundwater basin located mainly in the semi-arid headwaters of the Santa Margarita River watershed in southern California is the principle source of groundwater for a rural disadvantaged community and two Native American Tribes, the Ramona Band of Cahuilla and the Cahuilla. Groundwater in the study area is derived entirely from precipitation and managing groundwater sustainably requires an accurate assessment of the water balance components, yet long-term estimates do not exist. Demand for groundwater in the region has increased and groundwater quality has decreased due to population growth and increased irrigated cropland. To characterize monthly long-term natural recharge and runoff estimates, a physically-based water balance model (Basin Characterization Model) was locally calibrated and validated using nearby streamgages and published estimates of climatic and hydrologic variables. The average modeled annual recharge and runoff from 1981 to 2010 was 5.4 × 106and 1.2 × 107m3, respectively, for the study area. Recharge and runoff do not reliably occur in large amounts every year and recharge rarely occurs in the groundwater basin footprint. These long-term estimates can be used by water managers, stakeholders, and Native American Tribes to develop plans for sustainable management of future water resources, and as inputs to a three-dimensional groundwater model.INTRODUCTIONIncreased demand and limited quantities of subsurface water supply"
"managers, stakeholders, and Native American Tribes to develop plans for sustainable management of future water resources, and as inputs to a three-dimensional groundwater model.INTRODUCTIONIncreased demand and limited quantities of subsurface water supply (groundwater) in arid and semi-arid regions result in water scarcity, water quality issues, and difficulties in providing access to drinking water for the expanding populations (Scanlon et al.2006). In addition, recharge to a groundwater basin is highly variable in space and time and is difficult and expensive to accurately measure over large spatial scales. The groundwater from the Cahuilla Valley and Terwilliger Valley Groundwater Basins (CA DWR2016) -- located in the semi-arid headwaters of the Santa Margarita River watershed in southern California -- is the dominant source of water for a rural disadvantaged community and two Native American Tribes (Figure1). Demand for groundwater in the rural Anza-Cahuilla area has increased significantly because of population growth and the establishment of irrigated crops on previously unirrigated land (Woolfenden and Bright1988). The population of the Anza-Cahuilla area rose 15% between 2010 and 2017 (U.S. Census Bureau2020).FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointLocation figure of study area including streamgages (NWIS, National Water Information System) and upstream drainages, climate station (California Irrigation Management Information System, CIMIS), BCM (Basin Characterization"
"1Open in figure viewerPowerPointLocation figure of study area including streamgages (NWIS, National Water Information System) and upstream drainages, climate station (California Irrigation Management Information System, CIMIS), BCM (Basin Characterization Model) recharge area, Tribal lands, and groundwater basins (CA DWR2016).A previous study based on 1973 information (Moyle1976) identified water-table depressions adjacent to the Cahuilla Tribal Land that had increased the hydraulic gradient and caused the groundwater beneath the tribal land to flow toward the depressions. Examination of recent water level data indicates that there are seasonal changes in water-level altitude with water levels greater in spring and lower in fall (Christensen et al., in review). Continued population growth and resulting increases in groundwater demands may cause greater water-table declines in and around the Cahuilla Tribal Land and the City of Anza. The characteristics and water budget of this groundwater basin are not well understood and are threatened by increasing water use and potential changes in water availability related to climate change. There are no contemporary estimates of natural recharge or runoff to the basin and Landon et al. (2015) documented only previous historical estimates (CA DWR1956; Moyle1976; Woolfenden and Bright1988).In 2011, the County of Riverside received a grant from the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR)-Local Groundwater Assistance Fund"
"(2015) documented only previous historical estimates (CA DWR1956; Moyle1976; Woolfenden and Bright1988).In 2011, the County of Riverside received a grant from the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR)-Local Groundwater Assistance Fund to begin a program to develop groundwater management as well as evaluate and plan for groundwater monitoring in the Anza-Cahuilla area. Multiple groups have come together to plan, fund, and develop a Groundwater Management Plan to ensure the area has sustainable groundwater resources for future users (Anza Groundwater Association,https://sites.google.com/site/anzawatermgt/home). The Integrated Planning and Management Inc. Report (2011) described one of the primary tasks for the area to be planning and collecting existing available groundwater data. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled and analyzed groundwater data across a 60-year time frame and more recent work by Danielson (2018) has developed conceptual and analytical geochemical models for use in better groundwater quality management of the study area.Groundwater in the study area is derived predominantly from precipitation that is not intercepted by evapotranspiration. This water moves downward into the fractures and weathered zones of the consolidated rocks and either infiltrates past the root zone and recharges unconsolidated deposits, runs off into stream channels, or recharges the groundwater system by seepage through the permeable streambeds.

"fractures and weathered zones of the consolidated rocks and either infiltrates past the root zone and recharges unconsolidated deposits, runs off into stream channels, or recharges the groundwater system by seepage through the permeable streambeds. The quantity of groundwater in storage and therefore the water levels are dependent on a cycle of extended periods (>10 years) of relatively wet and dry conditions, where average conditions on any given year are uncommon (Woolfenden and Bright1988). With declines in precipitation, increases in drought frequency, increases in the demand for irrigation, and increases in the variability of recharge projected in the southern California region over the next century (Underwood et al.2018), it is vital to understand the current state of the hydrology in this area.The sustainable management of groundwater resources in this basin requires a reasonable quantification of the natural replenishment of groundwater to the aquifer to guide decision making for natural resource managers. The first step of this assessment is a compilation of available information, including regional measurements of various components of the water balance such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow. Using all available information, a weight of evidence approach is taken to validate measured components of the water balance and estimate the unmeasured components to assess long-term patterns of natural recharge spatially distributed across the basin.

"Using all available information, a weight of evidence approach is taken to validate measured components of the water balance and estimate the unmeasured components to assess long-term patterns of natural recharge spatially distributed across the basin. A follow-up to this assessment would consist of the complete hydrogeologic characterization of the basin and the development of a three-dimensional groundwater simulation tool or model supported by groundwater level measurements that would enable the estimation of distributed recharge to the aquifer and provide scenario testing to support sustainable groundwater management decisions.In this study, we quantify long-term estimates of recharge and runoff for the groundwater basins and surrounding watersheds in the Anza-Cahuilla area to support the sustainable management of a limited resource using a water balance approach with a locally calibrated Basin Characterization Model (BCM). Local calibrations of the BCM model have been applied in numerous basins globally to characterize water budget components including recharge, runoff, streamflow, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and climatic water deficit (Flint and Flint2012b; Flint et al.,2013a,2017,2019; Faunt et al.2015; Thorne et al.2015; Byrd et al.2019).

"et al.2015; Byrd et al.2019). In this paper, we first describe the study area and the BCM conceptual model, then we describe the available calibration and validation data used to refine the water balance estimates. Next, we compare the BCM inputs and outputs to published estimates of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), recharge, and AET. Finally, we present long-term estimates of recharge and runoff for the groundwater basin, and describe the relationship of precipitation to recharge and the spatiotemporal variability of recharge and runoff for the study area. The quantification of recharge and runoff and natural variability through historical climate change is vitally needed to inform local stakeholders and residents who solely rely groundwater for drinking, municipal use, and farming.Study AreaThe study area is defined by the hydrologic basins shown in Figure1, encompassing the rural areas in and around the City of Anza, Cahuilla and Ramona Band of Cahuilla Tribal Lands, and vicinity, located in the headwaters of the Santa Margarita River and San Jacinto watersheds, in Riverside County and the San Felipe Creek watershed in parts of Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial counties, California.

"(henceforth referred to as Anza-Cahuilla) includes California DWR groundwater subbasin 9-6 (Cahuilla Valley Groundwater Basin), subbasin 9-006 (Terwilliger Valley), and adjoining tributary watersheds that drain to downstream streamgages used for model calibration (CA DWR2016). The land that directly drains to the groundwater basin footprint (referred to as the BCM recharge basin) includes the Upper Cahuilla and Lower Cahuilla Creek and the Nance Canyon subbasins (hydrologic unit code-12: U.S. Geological Survey et al.2013) (bounded by red line in Figure1). The BCM recharge basin is consistent with groundwater footprints from previous studies (Landon et al.2015; Danielson2018), and slightly larger than the footprint from Moyle (1976) (Figure1). Locally the Nance Canyon area is also known as Terwilliger Valley. The Cahuilla and Terwilliger Valleys and associated creeks and streams that make up the BCM recharge basin are approximately 334 km2in area. The Anza-Cahuilla area ranges in altitude from approximately 2,070 m in the north at Thomas Mountain to approximately 640 m at the westernmost point in the BCM recharge basin. The average annual temperature for the City of Anza is 13.8°C with minimum temperatures near freezing in the winter months to maximum temperature above 32°C during July and August (Climate-Data.org).Average annual precipitation for the period 1981-2010 from local weather stations (stations not shown on map) ranges from about 297 mm at Hemet, approximately"

Snowfall extremes across the study area range between 254 mm occurring in early November to late April and freeze probability of 50% or greater occurring between late November and late March (WRCC2020b). Precipitation generally occurs in the winter months with infrequent rains in August and September related to monsoon moisture from the south. The geology (Jennings et al.2010) and vegetation (Fire Resource and Assessment Program:https://frap.fire.ca.gov/data/frapgisdata-land_cover) in the study area are diverse (Figure2a). The main geology types for the region and surrounding the valley fill deposits are mainly plutonic rocks and metasedimentary rock within the valley. These units of basement material vary from the hard competent basement to highly weathered or fractured, where highly weathered or decomposed the units are friable and allow for some surface infiltration and yield limited amounts of water to wells.

AET, actual evapotranspiration; PET, potential evapotranspiration.In the BCM water balance conceptual model (Figure3), rainfall that exceeds the soil storage will become runoff. Rainfall that percolates through the soil profile can become recharge if evapotranspiration does not exceed the amount of water available on a monthly time step. The basin discharge is calculated in post-processing using a set of equations that combines recharge and runoff using scaling parameters and exponential decay functions to match measured hydrographs. Recharge in this study calculated by the BCM is infiltration below the root zone that may be delayed in reaching the water table due to lateral flow and large unsaturated zones (>2 m). Estimates of groundwater recharge to the aquifer require hydrogeologic characterization and a groundwater model to calibrate to measured groundwater levels. A complete description of the BCM calculations and postprocessing equations can be found in Flint et al.

Precipitation and temperature grids were developed from Parameter- elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM,www.prism.oregonstate.edu; Daly et al.2008). The PRISM datasets are available from 1895 to present and were developed using climate station data and interpolated to 4-km grid cells for the contiguous United States. These grids were downscaled to 270 m using the Flint and Flint (2012a) method that employs Gradient-plus-Inverse-Distance Squared interpolation (Nalder and Wein1998), which develops relationships between elevation, easting, and northing for each grid cell to spatially downscale the large grids to finer-scale grids. PET was calculated using the downscaled PRISM climate and a modified Priestley-Taylor equation (Flint and Childs1984), incorporating topographic shading and cloudiness. The downscaled PRISM and PET were compared to a nearby CIMIS station (California Irrigation and Management Information System Hemet station 239, 40 miles northwest of Anza, Table1), which is presented in the results section.TABLE  1.Streamflow calibration gages (BCM ID 1-5) from NWIS for BCM streamflow basins, and CIMIS station (ID 239) used in climate comparison with station name, number, contributing area in m2, and period of record.BCM IDGage nameNWIS IDArea (m2)Period of record1Temecula Creek near"

Previously published estimates of recharge and other climatic and hydrologic variables were used for model validation.Historical streamflow data in the study area are sparse.

"been no active streamflow gages in the BCM recharge basin. Streamflow in the basin is generally ephemeral, rare, and flashy, thus developing a stage-discharge rating curve within a one-year field study would be difficult and likely contain high amounts of uncertainty. However, streamflow response to rainfall, snowmelt, and irrigation return events is vital to understanding the watershed and ultimately to calibrate runoff, recharge, and integrated hydrologic models. Streamflow gages in the surrounding area to the BCM recharge basin (Figure1; Table1) were used to calibrate the BCM model. Following calibration of AET for vegetation types in the study area to remotely sensed based estimates of AET (Reitz et al.2017), monthly streamgage data were downloaded from the National Water Information System (NWIS,https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) and used to calibrate BCM recharge and runoff in a postprocessing method (described in detail in Flint et al.,2013a,2013b,2021). After streamflow calibration, the BCM was run for the (water years) 1896-2018 period.Actual EvapotranspirationAET estimates (AETr) for calibration were downloaded (Reitz et al.2017) and clipped to the study area. The AETr dataset is a combined remote sensing and water-balance approach to estimate AET at 1-km resolution each month.

Time series of PET calculated from the BCM, AETr, and BCM AET (AETb) were extracted from the grids for each vegetation type for January 2000-December 2013 calibration period. AETr was divided by PET for each vegetation type to calculate a scaling factor,Kv, for each month that describes the proportion of PET that becomes AETb seasonally.To calibrate to the monthly time series of AETr data, BCM vegetation parameters were changed iteratively to optimize the match of AETb to AETr following the procedure in Flint et al. (2021). A rooting depth parameter is adjusted first and is used to increase the amount of available soil storage if AETb is lower than AETr on average. Other vegetation parameters were used to adjust the AETb rate to match AETr for each vegetation type based on the sensitivity to changes in annual precipitation. See Figure4for monthly AET for 2000-2013 with AETb matched to AETr estimates. The dominant vegetation types in the study area are relatively sensitive to annual differences in precipitation relative to mean conditions. Vegetation types that actively respond to precipitation events by having a flush of growth that generally occurs at less than a monthly time step are considered facultative vegetation types and are parameterized to compensate for this rapid growth.

The AETr is estimated using monthly remotely sensed images that may not accurately reflect the AET of these vegetation types at a finer temporal scale. These AET patterns are accounted for iteratively with comparisons of total recharge plus runoff to streamflow, and generally have higher than measured AET, as shown for Annual Grasslands in Figure4.FIGURE 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointLocal AET calibration results for four vegetation types.

To assess modeled basin discharge against observed data, statistics were calculated for all available streamgages includingR2and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency statistic (NSE; Nash and Sutcliffe1970). The NSE statistic is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance (\"noise\") compared to the measured data variance, and is calculated as:(1)where:is the ith observation,is the ith simulated value,is the mean of the observed data, and n is the total number of observations. NSE ranges between −∞ and 1.0, with NSE = 1.0 as the optimal value, and negative values indicating that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value.RESULTSAET CalibrationTime series of monthly AETr and AETb for the calibration period (2000-2013) for four major vegetation types show a good fit between the datasets (Figure4). Although the comparisons are performed against modeled data, utilizing estimates of other process-based estimates calibrated to remotely sensed data and constrained by water balance calculations ensured realistic estimates of AET in absence of measured data.

Overestimation of peaks by the BCM was partially due to the submonthly response of plant growth that was undersampled by the AETr and thus compensated for by the BCM calibration for these facultative vegetation types.In addition to visual comparisons, statistics were calculated to compare AETr with AETb (Table2) for the simulation period and showed a reasonably good representation (R2= 0.56-0.71) of the AETr data for the vegetation types that dominated the study area, chamise-redshank chaparral and mixed chaparral (62% of the study area). Coastal scrub and annual grasslands, covering 8% of the area, hadR2of 0.43-0.5, but desert scrub and juniper, covering 14% of the area had poorR2fits of <0.17. The mean error was on average −1.1 mm/month, and was generally less than ±5 mm/month except for Juniper and Cropland, which were 6.4 and −8.7 mm/month, respectively.

The poor calibration result at Coyote Creek (BCM Basin 4) could be due to diversions not accounted for in the BCM, or the inability of the BCM to capture the temporal variability of a flashy ephemeral system. Generally, the streams with higher flows had better calibration statistics than streams that were mostly dry, possibly emphasizing the limitations of the BCM to reflect evaporation from or infiltration into streambeds.TABLE  3.Streamflow calibration results for five gages in the study area.BCM basin IDBasin gage nameNWIS IDR2NSE1Temecula Creek near Aguanga110424000.810.812Wilson Creek above Vail Lake near Radec110424900.710.703Bautista Creek at Mouth near Valle Vista110700700.880.794Coyote Creek near Borrego Springs102558000.45−0.105Palm Canyon Creek near Palm Springs102585000.720.64NoteNSE, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency.Comparison of BCM to Previously Published DataBCM inputs (precipitation and PET) and calibrated outputs (AET, runoff, and recharge) were compared to available published data to validate recharge estimates in absence of physical quantitative measurements.

Multiple precipitation estimates were available for varying periods, and gridded precipitation inputs used for the BCM (downscaled PRISM climate) were compared to other published data (Table4). The long-term estimates of precipitation from Moyle (1976) were temporally averaged but varied spatially across the study area. The annual averages from the Moyle (1976) study were calculated using station data and the long-term spatial distribution of precipitation.

Although the AETb estimate is about 30% lower than Moyle's calculation, the BCM recharge is only slightly higher than Moyle's recharge estimate. To calculate the average annual AET, Moyle used a constant consumptive use of native pasture of 406 mm/year, or 95% of rainfall, whichever was smaller. AETb calculations are based on the BCM water balance and calibrated as described in the \"Calibration and Validation\" section.Recharge and Runoff EstimatesLong-term natural recharge estimates are difficult to quantify, especially in areas without detailed field surveys or groundwater models. Recharge and runoff are highly temporally variable in the BCM recharge basin: runoff ranged from zero to 5.8 × 107m3or 50,000 ac-ft per month (Figure6) for water years 1896-2018.FIGURE 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointMonthly modeled recharge (green) and runoff (orange) for the BCM recharge basin from water years"

In wetter years the ratio of recharge to runoff decreases. In drier years, the recharge to runoff ratio is higher, and recharge can be equal to or higher than runoff in some areas. The occurrence of recharge and runoff can be unreliable with several years between any substantive amount. The relation of recharge to precipitation is exponential in arid and semi-arid regions and often requires the exceedance of a precipitation threshold to produce substantial recharge or runoff (Figure7), and the long-term average is highly dependent upon which years are used. Flint et al. (2012) illustrate this as well and describe the episodic nature of recharge in semiarid and arid environments, at both local and global scales. At or above around 300 mm of precipitation, the BCM recharge basin begins to produce significant amounts of recharge and higher increases for a given increase in precipitation.

Between 1998 and 2018, only four years (green squares in Figure7) of 21 had greater than the 1981-2010 average recharge (purple \"X\" in Figure7) and dry years occurred more frequently than wet years relative to the 300 mm precipitation threshold. The average annual recharge and runoff from 1981 to 2010 over the BCM recharge basin (larger than the Moyle study area) were 5.4 × 106and 1.2 × 107m3, respectively. However, the long-term average value for recharge is not a reliable estimate for any given year in this region due to the extreme interannual variability. Calculating the long-term average for the 1971-2000 period includes the highest peak on record in February 1980 and thus increases the long-term averages of recharge and runoff to 7.3 × 106and 1.6 × 107m3, respectively.FIGURE 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointScatter plot of annual (water year) precipitation (mm/year) and modeled recharge (m3/year, blue dots) for the BCM recharge basin for water years 1896-2018.

The BCM recharge basin covers the groundwater basin as well as the surrounding hillslopes. Recharge frequently occurs outside of the groundwater basin and rarely over the groundwater basin footprint (Flint and Flint2007). Most of the precipitation occurs in the northern and southern corners of the recharge basin, outside of the groundwater basin. Even with two wet years in the 2011-2018 period (Figure8a), the BCM recharge basin was still slightly drier than the long-term average of 16 mm/year with an average of only 15 mm/year (Figure8b).FIGURE 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointAverage annual recharge maps for (a) water years 2011-2018 and (b) water years 1981-2010.Average annual recharge indicates the highest amount of recharge generally occurs in locations with higher than average precipitation, but not necessarily the area with the most amount of precipitation. Differing vegetation types will variably compete for available water prior to infiltration, and different geologic types will control the rate at which available water can recharge below the root zone.DISCUSSIONAccurate long-term estimates are vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, and no direct spatially distributed measurements currently exist.

"below the root zone.DISCUSSIONAccurate long-term estimates are vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, and no direct spatially distributed measurements currently exist. Modeled recharge estimates cannot be directly validated without expensive large-scale field measurements that still only represent the point location being measured. The BCM calculates \"natural\" recharge spatially across the entire watershed on the basis of multiple gridded datasets, all of which can be tested or validated. Natural recharge in this study is defined as the total water that makes it through the root zone, and therefore may be different from actual recharge to the groundwater aquifer due to lag times between the unsaturated zone and the aquifer where evapotranspiration losses as well as seepage back into the surface water can occur and does not include perching layers or redistribution of water within the saturated zone. BCM natural recharge estimates do not include irrigation or water imports from other basins and do not account for differences in streambed hydraulic conductivity.Climate forcing data like precipitation and air temperature are one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in water balance modeling (Gourley and Vieux2005), and fine-scale gridded estimates can provide a more robust spatial and temporal estimate of precipitation in areas that have little to no nearby long-term station data (Moriasi and Starks2010; Flint and Flint2012a; Vergara et al.2014)."

Gridded datasets, such as PRISM, use station data along with other physiographically sensitive algorithms for interpolation (Daly et al.2008), and when coupled with spatial downscaling to finer scales can provide an accurate model input. However, even with the limitations of input data uncertainty and model uncertainty, the overall water balance components can be determined from this study.CONCLUSIONLong-term estimates of natural recharge and runoff were calculated for the Anza-Cahuilla groundwater basin using a water balance model and were found to be highly variable across space and time. The BCM is a physically based water balance model that simulates monthly recharge and runoff for each 270-m grid cell, and was refined from a California-wide model and locally calibrated to the study area. Using limited available calibration data, a weight of evidence approach was taken to validate measured components of the water balance and to estimate the unmeasured components to assess long-term patterns of natural recharge and runoff spatially across the basin.

"long-term patterns of natural recharge and runoff spatially across the basin. Climate inputs and hydrologic outputs of the model were compared to previously published estimates in or near the study area over identical locations and footprints and were found to be consistent.Annual recharge and runoff ranged from zero to 2.6 × 107and 7.7 × 107m3, with average values of 6.1 × 106and 1.2 × 107m3, respectively from water years 1896 to 2018. Recharge estimates calculated for the 1981-2010 period decreased to 5.4 × 106m3, however, the runoff estimate was similar to the 1896-2018 period. In the last 20 years, only four years reached or exceeded the long-term average, highlighting the interannual variability and suggesting that ten-year periods of alternating wet and dry periods no longer describe the climatic patterns in this area. Recharge and runoff do not occur in large amounts every year, and when very wet years occur, most of the water becomes runoff and a lesser component becomes recharge. A nonlinear relationship of precipitation to recharge was shown, where <200-300 mm/year of precipitation produced negligible recharge. This finding is consistent with other studies in arid and semi-arid environments (Scanlon et al.2006). In drier years, a larger proportion of the precipitation can become recharge, depending on precipitation intensity.

"In drier years, a larger proportion of the precipitation can become recharge, depending on precipitation intensity. Recharge infrequently occurs within the recharge basin and even less frequently in the groundwater basin footprint. Instead, recharge tends to occur in the surrounding higher elevation areas in the northern and southern corners of the BCM recharge basin. The spatial distribution of recharge is controlled across a watershed by varying climatic patterns, soil properties, and geology characteristics, and may not occur within the footprint of the underlying groundwater basin.Water managers can use estimates of historical natural recharge to develop plans for the sustainable use of groundwater in the future, and results from this study can be used as inputs to a three-dimensional groundwater model that can account for unsaturated zone flow processes to the groundwater basin. Future climate scenarios could be applied to this model to determine the uncertainty in future groundwater availability through changes in climate. Though the values represented in this study are consistent with previous investigations, the actual values may vary. The values presented should be validated and adjusted as appropriate by calibrating to measured groundwater level changes using an integrated hydrologic model that couples recharge, streamflow, precipitation, and aquifer properties.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was funded by a grant from the California Department of Water Resources, for"

"AbstractIn light of the current financial information management system's poor performance, this paper proposes a design method for a financial information management system based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which improves the system's operation performance by improving the system hardware structure setting and improving the system software function combined with the principle of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Finally, the experiment demonstrates that the financial information management system based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation has a high practicability in the process of practical application, allowing it to effectively avoid financial management risk while also improving financial information management quality.1. IntroductionFinancial management systems are the future development path in this area. To achieve real-time synchronization of various financial data from the enterprise, the system uses modern methods of data entry, data processing, and data storage. As a result of the continuous improvement of the national economic system, the economic interests of various types of companies in society have improved, and the industrial outcomes have made qualitative leap, leading to the formation of the current big data model of finance. The amount of financial data is enormous, and there are many types of data that have led to the formation of current big data models in finance.

"data model of finance. The amount of financial data is enormous, and there are many types of data that have led to the formation of current big data models in finance. Big data is a relatively new term and has received a lot of attention in recent years [1]. By recognizing a large number of data characteristics with complex sources, you can capture the connections between the data and analyze different data metrics. Given the unique characteristics of current financial data, we omit traditional sample analysis and collection methods of data processing when conducting risk assurance assessments of a company's financial information management system [2,3]. All financial data and information of a company are large, fast, diverse, and slow in order to accurately understand system risks, keep risk modules secure in a timely manner, and ensure the safety of the company's financial information. It is processed by the data. The introduction of this estimation approach frees corporate financial managers from the burden of risk management and management and provides the concept of risk estimation in other information management systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been viewed as the focal point of merging industrialization and information technology as information technology has advanced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that links systems, systems, and people to information resources and intelligence services. Data are gathered and exchanged via a standard protocol"
"information technology as information technology has advanced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that links systems, systems, and people to information resources and intelligence services. Data are gathered and exchanged via a standard protocol by means of the IoT, unlike how industrial EMS components operate.2. Financial Information Management System Based on Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation2.1. Hardware Structure Optimization of Financial Information Management SystemThe system development technology includes asp.net technology and Visual Studio development environment. The mature net framework is adopted in the design, the operating system adopts Windows Server 2007 version, and the system access can be realized as long as the client is above IE60. The database platform adopts Microsoft SQL Server 2000 enterprise version, which is convenient for management and operation. The foreground development tool adopts Visualstudio.netdevelopment tool [3]. The improvement climate is the Visual Studio 2005 incorporated improvement climate, which makes framework improvement and testing a breeze. The current popular ORM framework is adopted, and the ORM mapping layer adopts hibernate. Developers can realize database operation without writing code. Enterprise financial information system is a complex database, which contains many contents, the most important of which are administrative business processing, enterprise asset allocation, and management information system [4].
