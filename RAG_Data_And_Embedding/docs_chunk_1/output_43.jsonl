"emotional, and time-consuming work\" to manage health information (p. 101). For LGBQ parents, the invisible work required by the Irish government to avail of \"equality\" for their children (in the form of a birth certificate that recognizes two mothers) is similar.5.2Negative affectParticipants' discussions of emotions in the context of Jones (2008) PIM activities such as finding, organizing, maintaining, and making sense is most often in a negative context, particularly feelings of anxiety, frustration, and a loss of control. This is similar to the affective dimensions of PIM identified by Alon and Nachmias (2020), who found the salient affective aspects of PIM to be anxiety, efficacy, frustration, desperation, belonging, dependence, and loss of control that manifests when PIM is practiced.In describing their experience of attempting to obtain a birth certificate for their child, the LGBQ parents described the experience as highly affectual and often in a negative context. Mothers generally found the pre-birth certificate process of gathering information on how to go about obtaining a birth certificate more straightforward than others, while fathers found the post-birth certificate information management experience associated with obtaining a passport for their children more difficult. This was largely a result of the Child and Family Relationships Act of 2015 providing a path for two mothers to be listed on a birth certificate if they met specific requirements: ART in an"
"with obtaining a passport for their children more difficult. This was largely a result of the Child and Family Relationships Act of 2015 providing a path for two mothers to be listed on a birth certificate if they met specific requirements: ART in an Irish clinic after a specific date, evidence of maternity, evidence of cohabitation and/or marriage; and application to change the birth certificate fields.The most used words to describe the experiences were devastating/sadness, stressful and frustrating. However, it is difficult to separate perceived feelings of inequality from the PIM activities in which the participants engaged, because the PIM was completed in a context of perceived inequality. For example, feelings of frustration were associated with an acknowledgement that as an LGBQ parent, the individual would have to engage in more PIM tasks (\"work\") than is expected of heterosexual parents, such as preparing documentation for a solicitor in obtaining guardianship. Alon and Nachmias (2020) did not describe the relationships between the context and the affective dimensions of PIM they found. As such, it is unclear if the PIM, the context, or both is the root of the negative affect. Future work is needed that explores not only PIM activities, but PIM activitiesin different contexts. This would address Ocepek's (2017) call to study the everyday, by positioning PIM activities in thecontextof the everyday.These negative emotions were discussed in relation to personal"
"not only PIM activities, but PIM activitiesin different contexts. This would address Ocepek's (2017) call to study the everyday, by positioning PIM activities in thecontextof the everyday.These negative emotions were discussed in relation to personal information, such as where there was a lack of recognition for two LGBQ parents on a birth certificate for their child. The experiences discussed demonstrate how this lack of recognition on a personal document can cause ripple effects, impacting the personal information LGBQ parents must manage on a day-to-day basis triggering negative emotions. Similar to how Allan and Wilson (2003) and Ancker et al. (2015) describe feelings of stress leading to information behavior that resulted in feeling an information overload, lack of recognition on the birth certificate led LGBQ parents to engage in additional PIM. For example, only the parent listed on the birth certificate could make medical decisions and sign school papers for the child, creating uneven caring work in a two-parent family. This draws similarities with Dalmer's (2020) finding that the information work associated with care is often invisible, and further aligns the findings of this study with previous findings related to health IB. According to Ocepek (2017), healthcare is a major area within everyday IB because it is \"information rich\" (p. 400).

"health IB. According to Ocepek (2017), healthcare is a major area within everyday IB because it is \"information rich\" (p. 400). However, particularly regarding managing personal health information, the tasks involve PIM. This demonstrates that PIM has the potential to be included in the exploration of the everyday because it can be used as a device to elucidate invisible work in \"information rich\" everyday contexts. Like Dalmer and Huvila (2019) who call on scholars to use work as a lens in inquiry to bring to light informational undertakings, we call on scholars to use PIM, and PIM activities in different contexts to further explore invisible, affective information work.5.3Birth certificates and self extension to digital possessionsCushing (2012,2013) found that in the context of the meta-level PIM activity of maintaining, and PDA characteristic of maintaining for the long term, digital possessions in personal digital collections can contribute to a sense of identity. However, the LGBQ parents that we interviewed in this study expressed the opposite: many spoke at length about how their child's birth certificate did not represent their child, themselves as parents, or their families and made them feel vulnerable. This feeling aligns with findings from Potnis and Winberry's (2021) information vulnerability, as the LGBQ parents we interviewed, the document did not affirm their identity. In discussing how their child's birth certificate did not represent them, participants"
"aligns with findings from Potnis and Winberry's (2021) information vulnerability, as the LGBQ parents we interviewed, the document did not affirm their identity. In discussing how their child's birth certificate did not represent them, participants highlighted that the birth certificate was meant to represent their child but it contained incorrect and/or false information about the child's parents. Due to this incorrect/false information, the document served as evidence of an LGBQ parent family's unequal status in the eyes of the Irish government.Other participants discussed how birth certificates that did not include both parents' names \"felt wrong.\" The concept of \"feeling wrong\" or not representing me was associated with Cushing's (2012) finding that individuals expressed the desire to discard personal information that did not represent them in the context of a digital legacy.Previous research confirms the central role the birth certificate can play in contributing to a sense of identity, rendering this finding even more unusual because it conflicts with findings described in previous research (Bainham,2008). Therefore, when self-extension to personal information is expected based on previous research and the opposite (it does not represent me) is found, it is likely that this lack of self-extension can contribute to the perception that management of the personal information (in this case, the birth certificate) may be perceived as a burden.5.4Information"
"the opposite (it does not represent me) is found, it is likely that this lack of self-extension can contribute to the perception that management of the personal information (in this case, the birth certificate) may be perceived as a burden.5.4Information seekingInformation seeking was the only theme in which PIM activities and PDA characteristics were not found to be present. However specific IB theories and literature was found to be especially relevant. Dalmer (2020) and Kim (2020) found that caregivers were more likely to experience information overload and therefore view information seeking as a burden. Similarly, our participants also expressed that the information seeking they were required to complete felt overwhelming. When asked about the process for locating information about parenting as a same sex couple in Ireland using DAHR, Participant 10 replied \"it takes many years and it's almost a full-time job.\"Participants also expressed that most people did not know that marriage equality did not extend to LGBQ parental rights, so there was a lack of understanding and empathy associated with their plight. Interestingly, this did not result in secrecy, deception, or self-protective behaviors, which Chatman (1996) included in her six propositions of information poverty. Greyson (2017) and Gibson and Martin (2019) also found that information poverty did not necessarily apply to many aspects of their cases of young parents seeking health information and parents of children"
"in her six propositions of information poverty. Greyson (2017) and Gibson and Martin (2019) also found that information poverty did not necessarily apply to many aspects of their cases of young parents seeking health information and parents of children with down syndrome and autism seeking information.Gibson and Martin (2019) list information deficits (lack of trustworthy information and locally relevant information sources, perception of information being withheld, and lack of information about rights), and class (ableism, information literacy/parent education, income inequality: time and money, and racial inequity) as marginalization factors. The only two factors that we found to have applied to this case are lack of information about rights and income inequality: time and money. As was described above, some parents were unaware that the marriage referendum of 2015 did not provide additional rights for LGBQ parents. Parents discussed additional legal fees to secure guardianship and/or fees DNA testing to prove paternity, as well as time spent researching and managing information.A significant aspect of this information seeking process was that many respondents found it difficult to find out information within the Irish context, often having to rely on LGBQ networks and contacts. In some instances, many of the parents decided that Ireland, because of its lack of legislation and protections, was an unsafe place to have a child if you were same-sex parents, so accordingly"
"context, often having to rely on LGBQ networks and contacts. In some instances, many of the parents decided that Ireland, because of its lack of legislation and protections, was an unsafe place to have a child if you were same-sex parents, so accordingly decided to look towards other jurisdictions internationally. This resulted in many of the LGBQ parents having to engage in further information seeking processes to understand ART procedures in other countries and then determine how they could relocate to those countries temporarily or permanently.The Irish system resulted in some of the participants seeking information about ART in other jurisdictions, which at points was considered difficult given that much of this is not catered or mainstreamed towards potential LGBQ parents.The information seeking process accordingly proves to be a burden for LGBQ parents, due to the fact that there is no clear pathway to parenthood and often, it is difficult to locate or discern the correct information, leading to a sense of confusion. This confusing process led to many of the parents looking towards \"paving the way\" for those who would come after them, making the process somewhat easier. As a result of difficulties that many have experienced as they tried to find information about the process, several participants had decided to participate in nonprofit groups who provide information on their websites about the same-sex parenting process in Ireland.In this way, the burden of the"
"experienced as they tried to find information about the process, several participants had decided to participate in nonprofit groups who provide information on their websites about the same-sex parenting process in Ireland.In this way, the burden of the information seeking process develops queer kinship structures within the community of LGBQ parents, as noted in the literature review above. These kinship structures manifested among LGBQ parents in this study, particularly within the context of the burden of information seeking, with the aim of providing affective support, community, and coalitions in helping LGBQ parents navigate an extremely complex and convoluted field of PIM, particularly related to birth certificates. The proliferation of queer kinship structures among the participants is a response to the information seeking burden within the community because of having no formalized State support or recognition. In some ways, it is a community response to manage the burden of this information seeking. In this sense, queer kinship may fit with Savolainen's (1995) description of ELIS to attempt \"mastery of life,\" where active mastery of life is associated with \"pragmatic problem solving in cases where the order of things has been shaken or threatened\" (p. 264).6 DISCUSSIONIn our method of \"following the PIM,\" we initially thought that Savolainen's (1995) ELIS Chatman's (1996) information poverty, and Allan and Wilson's (2003) information overload may be relevant in"
"things has been shaken or threatened\" (p. 264).6 DISCUSSIONIn our method of \"following the PIM,\" we initially thought that Savolainen's (1995) ELIS Chatman's (1996) information poverty, and Allan and Wilson's (2003) information overload may be relevant in helping us understand the burden that participants discussed. However, we found that these theories held less relevance that the concept of invisible work discussed by Dalmer and Huvila (2019) and Ancker et al. (2015); Gibson and Martin's (2019) theory of information poverty; Greyson's (2017) exploration of the information seeking of young parents, and Potnis and Winberry's (2021) discussion of information vulnerability. Existing research on health IB was particularly relevant. While much of this research involves PIM, it does not situate PIM at the center of the exploration, which was our aim in this study. We argue that by centralizing PIM within information research, there exists potential to harness the concept of PIM to make inequalities more tangible. For example, if government policy increases the amount of PIM in which individuals of a specific group must engage, does PIM become a burden in such a context, and does that burden hold potential to become an indicator of inequality? As PIM in broader socio-cultural processes becomes a shaping factor for constructing and exposing inequalities, it becomes difficult to address this question due to a lack of concepts and theoretical frameworks within PIM that can be applied"
"inequality? As PIM in broader socio-cultural processes becomes a shaping factor for constructing and exposing inequalities, it becomes difficult to address this question due to a lack of concepts and theoretical frameworks within PIM that can be applied to a variety of contexts.To address this, we propose a new framework for understanding this: personal information burden (PIM-B). We propose PIM-B as a conceptual tool that may provide frameworks for understanding inequalities that occur when marginalized groups are burdened with disproportionate PIM requirements to obtain and/or engage with necessary personal information, such as a birth certificate for their children.This led us to propose the following characteristics of a PIM-B:Additional PIM activities: There exists an understanding that a marginalized group or class of people must engage inadditional required PIM activities(sometimes with an associated extra cost) to obtain access to a service or entitlement, in which non-marginalized populations do not have to engage. These additional PIM activities create a burden. The additional activities also track to PIM activities established by Jones (2008);Negative affect: The PIM is discussed as highly affectual and most often negatively; closely aligning it with thestressexperienced from information overload as described by Bawden et al. (1999); Allan and Wilson (2003); and affective interactions discussed by Alon and Nachmias (2020);Lack of identity self extension to the"
"negatively; closely aligning it with thestressexperienced from information overload as described by Bawden et al. (1999); Allan and Wilson (2003); and affective interactions discussed by Alon and Nachmias (2020);Lack of identity self extension to the personal information: There exists a disagreement with the \"represents me\" characteristic andlink between personal information and identityfindings from Cushing (2012,2013) and others. This can lead to a feeling of vulnerability (Potnis & Winberry,2021);Additional information seeking: There exists an understanding that the information seeking process is designed for the non-marginalized, majority group. This creates the requirement for the marginalized group to engage inadditional information seekingto complete the same task that the non-marginalized group can potentially arrive at in fewer procedural steps.Additional PIM tasks that the LGBQ population in our study must endure can trigger negative affective behavior, which can lead to a recognition of the additional PIM as aburden. The recognition of inequality and the ways in which inequality can be recognized as a burden, mediated our participants' experiences.Often this PIM-B, particularly considering our participants, results in minority communities being burdened with the labor of explaining their inequalities to broader mainstream society.

"results in minority communities being burdened with the labor of explaining their inequalities to broader mainstream society. The often-invisible PIM work became a means by which to explain the marginalized group's burden to non-marginalized groups. Our participants demonstrated this need to explain their inequalities through their interactions with government officials, which often resulted in them having to complete additional PIM tasks. In this sense, the PIM burden becomes a tool to make inequality measurable: by explaining the extra PIM and procedural steps required to avail of equality.Thinking through PIM-B in this way supplies a framework which, can help in understanding the vulnerabilities created for a swathe of minority and vulnerable communities, and also, exposes the ways in which mainstream, normative institutions that govern the conventions of PIM can create vulnerabilities. Developing this framework can help other communities who face PIM-B. When an organization or State imposes processes and procedures that require PIM activities that vary greatly in task and complexity for different groups, inequality may be present.7 CONCLUSIONIn this project, we attempted to explore the nonwork dimensions of PIM for a marginalized population, to understand how PIM can be utilized as a potential indicator of inequality.

"marginalized population, to understand how PIM can be utilized as a potential indicator of inequality. We found that research on invisible information work (Dalmer & Huvila,2019), information marginalization (Gibson & Martin,2019), and burdens associated with health IB (Ancker et al.,2015; Dalmer,2020; Greyson,2017) to hold more relevance than Chatman (1996) and Savolainen (1995).This research teases out the PIM related to LGBQ parents' attempts to obtain Irish birth certificates for their children. We were able to identify four characteristics that position nonwork PIM as burden, or PIM-B: (1) Additional PIM activities; (2) Negative affect; (3) Lack of identity and self extension to the personal information; and (4) Additional information seeking. As a framework, PIM-B demonstrates an expansion of information behavior by explicitly applying it to PIM activities to understand where theories may be relevant. In the future, PIM-B has the potential to act as an indicator of inequality, which could be expanded to include other aspects of information behavior, beyond PIM.ACKNOWLEDGMENTOpen access funding provided by IReL.REFERENCESAgosto, D.

"AbstractWith the rapid development of information technology and network technology, all kinds of data increase exponentially, and the traditional relational databases cannot handle these data well, which is also reflected in the sharp increase in the number of college students. The amount of students' information is increasing exponentially and the simple management method in the past can no longer meet the needs of the new situation. This paper adopts B/S mode and three-tier architecture and relies on network technology and ASP.NET technology to design and implement the student information management system. The system is divided into eight functional modules: comprehensive information inquiry for students, scholarship evaluation, evaluation and award, economic recognition, student loan management, student violation, communication and feedback, and system management. Different operation interfaces are designed according to four users with different permissions: students, class tutors, college administrators, and student affairs offices. This paper describes the system analysis, design, and implementation in detail. The practice results show that the initial use of the student information database management reflects well and achieves the expected goal.

"and achieves the expected goal. The system is easy to maintain and extensible and has good application value. The operation of the system has greatly improved the management efficiency of student affairs and enabled the student affairs administrators to complete various student affairs more efficiently. Campus information construction is becoming an important part of the overall construction of colleges and universities, and it is also a basic and continuous work. Accelerating the establishment of a set of comprehensive, perfect, and efficient student comprehensive management information systems is an urgent need to promote the modernization of college student management. The modernization, informatization, and standardization of college student management are a complex systematic project. Only by relying on modern information technology can we cope with the base pressure brought by the continuous enrollment expansion of college students, promote the flat and intensive utilization of college management information, and improve the efficiency and quality of service.1. IntroductionAs the core feature of the current informatization development, the Internet is being completely integrated with various industries to activate the inherent development potential of various industries.

"inherent development potential of various industries. In the integration with education, this is not a simple superposition. The power of one plus one will be far greater than two. The new form of the Internet is being developed under innovation 2.0, and innovation will make this superposition play a more obvious role. When traditional education encounters Innovation 2.0, education will be forced to change. The change is first reflected in the educational concept. The educational concept should pay more attention to people-oriented, based on the application of knowledge, and make the whole educational process natural and comfortable. The Internet and various industries have achieved integrated development, so a large amount of data has been generated. Therefore, the design and management of the database can improve the efficiency of the work. In recent years, network security cases have occurred frequently, further improving database security management. Taking the campus network security incident as an example, the economic loss exceeded 700000 yuan because the campus database security prevention work was not in place. It can be seen that carrying out database security protection work can effectively ensure the property safety of the public and make social production and life go smoothly [1].In order to solve the problem of the increase in data volume and the insufficiency of relational databases in dealing with complex structures, this paper introduces a No SQL database"
"safety of the public and make social production and life go smoothly [1].In order to solve the problem of the increase in data volume and the insufficiency of relational databases in dealing with complex structures, this paper introduces a No SQL database and adopts the technical route of C/S or B/S according to the actual situation for development. C/S is mainly used for students' terminals and management personnel mainly use mobile phones as carriers, conduct corresponding communication, and interaction through Internet technology, and use mobile terminal browsers to operate. The B/S architecture is applied to all participants of the platform, mainly for PC terminals, using the SSH framework for operation. For development, the server uses the Centos7 system, the platform construction uses Nginx + Tomcat for dynamic and static separation, the database uses the MariaDB database, the front-end development uses the Bootstrap framework for rapid development and provides a web page compatibility mode to adapt to different types of browsers. The design and establishment steps of the student information database, the logical structure of the database and its constituent elements, the development strategy of the management and analysis system, the system function, and its realization principle are introduced [2].

The development and application of the system realizes the integrated spatial management and in-depth analysis and utilization of multisource student information such as student sources, attendance, grades, awards, honors, postgraduate entrance exams, and employment at the basic teaching organization side, providing scientific planning, implementation, management, and evaluation. The grass-roots teaching work provides accurate and detailed information reference and visual and intuitive tool support, which effectively promotes the comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development of all work.As a grass-roots organization for teaching management and implementation, both departments and teaching and research offices are responsible for the formulation of student training programs, the construction of curriculum systems, the revision of syllabus, the optimization of teaching content, the reform of teaching methods, the teaching of theoretical knowledge, the guidance of experiment and practice, the evaluation of teaching quality, the construction of a good style of study, the organization of scientific and technological activities, the evaluation of professional construction, and other work directly facing or serving students.

"of professional construction, and other work directly facing or serving students. The success of these works depends on the understanding and understanding of students [3]. Only by comprehensively collecting and making full use of a variety of student information, such as hobbies, advantages and specialties, academic performance, awards and honors, employment and further study, can we ensure the overall planning, scientific coordination, and healthy and sustainable development of all work, so as to truly achieve student-centered, respect for personality, teach students in accordance with their aptitude, and promote excellence. The innovation of the research method used in this system lies in the following points:First, through the specification and standardization of the responsibilities of administrators, student managers, and students, these students also take responsibility and supervision to a limited extent, so as to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of data collections.Second, the administrator teacher can formulate policies suitable for the situation of the class by extracting the overall data of the class. At the same time, according to the data statistics of the relevant performance of a certain classmate in a certain time period, more targeted measures can be adopted for the students' communication and guidance.Third, students can use the system to check their performance in the specified time period, so as to make accurate judgments for themselves and at the"

Related WorkWan et al. believe that databases have gradually entered people's sight, and their security has become more and more important to society with the in-depth development of the Internet and various industries [5]. Therefore, Zhang and Qin analyzes from the perspective of database security in order to provide a theoretical basis for related protection work. Among them, confidentiality is one of the main characteristics of computer databases [6]. Zhang and Yang analyzed that all data in the database is kept secret from the user when no security authorization is obtained [7]. On the basis of confidentiality, integrity is also the main feature of the database. Integrity mainly refers to the complete protection of data resources of the database. Noraziah A pointed out that with the rapid development of informatization and networking, the system model of affairs management of a single functional department cannot fully meet the actual requirements of the current development of colleges and universities [8].

He-Ping relies on network technology and ASP.NET technology, applies B/S mode, and uses ADO.NET database access technology to realize the real meaning of student information database management [9]. Student management is an important part of the work of colleges and universities, and the establishment of a comprehensive, complete and efficient student-integrated management information system is gradually being included in the agendas of colleges and universities. The development of higher education needs the support of timely, accurate and well-functioning information systems. Sun X has long put forward the construction goals of campus modernization, informatization, and internationalization. According to this goal, it has refined several specific goals, including: realizing the digitization, informatization, and network of teaching, research and services on the campus of the University of Finance and Economics Realize the rational planning, distribution, and effective utilization of information resources and information services [10]. In view of this, Peng and Xu also designed and developed a comprehensive educational administration system with relatively complete functions under the premise of basically satisfying the school's implementation of the credit system for educational administration management.

The system designed by Chaudhry et al, etc., its student status management function can realize the query and analysis of schools (training units), professional information, and student information. An authoritative student status information query system [12]. Zhou and others implement credit system management, focusing on the educational thought and concept of \"student development-oriented\" in the process of student education and teaching. This system provides comprehensive technical support for school teaching management [13]. The online information query system of the Ministry of Education and Industry, which Zhou assisted in designing, includes functions such as the functions and responsibilities of the Ministry of Education and Industry, internal institutions, system management, communication, and inquiry of related information. This system has reached the advanced level of similar educational affairs software [14].3.

"Internet + Education\"Internet + education\" is a hot topic and hot word in the current education reform and practice. In the field of educational informatization technology, almost all plans and speeches must be discussed, and special attention is paid to them. \"Internet + education\" is not the network of existing education; it is a new stage of the development of education informatization technology, and it is the basis for technology to promote revolutionary changes in education [15]. Although \"Internet + education\" is just beginning to emerge, it is unstoppable. The development of the teaching mode under the background of \"Internet + education\" in the 5G era is divided into the following aspects, as shown in Figure1:(1)Integrating Teaching Resources.Colleges and universities should organize teachers to effectively integrate traditional and online learning resources; rebuild the database of teaching resources; collect information resources related to professional teaching extensively; provide rich materials for teachers' teaching design; and provide sufficient learning resources for students' autonomous learning and inquiry.(2)Construct Diversified Teaching Mode.

In the new teaching mode, the school should pay attention to learning evaluation so as to restrain students' learning behavior and ensure their participation in classroom and online teaching. At the same time, the evaluation results should be taken as the basis for improving teaching quality, and the construction of the educational resource banks should be improved, educational equipment should be updated, teaching methods should be improved, and teaching content should be innovated.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4.

"of the previous stage into a specific database. According to the various relations obtained earlier, they are now converted into data tables. The system mainly includes student information tables, class information tables, grade information tables, course information tables, and professional information tables [17]. Database design mainly includes the logical design and physical design of the database. Usually, the logical design is carried out first, and then the physical design is carried out. The database of the student information management system in this study is designed with the Oracle database, and a total of 7 data tables are created, and their structures are shown in Table1:1.Structure of student information sheet.Field nameType of dataField length and formatKeywordsStudent IDVARCHAR15YESNameVARCHAR20NOGenderCHAR2NOPolitical statusVARCHAR12NODate of birthDATEYYYY-MM-DDNOSpecializedVARCHAR20NOClassVARCHAR20NOContact numberVARCHAR15NOAfter the establishment of the student information database, the data can be browsed, queried, edited, counted, analyzed, mapped and other operations through the ArcGIS desktop system.

"universal, professional, and other characteristics. Although the desktop system has rich and powerful functions, it is still difficult to meet the specific application needs in terms of flexibility, convenience, practicality, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to extend and customize the design and develop an applied GIS system for student information management and analysis business [18].Arcengine supports a variety of development languages such as.Net, Java, VB, VC, Delphi, c++. Different languages have their own advantages and disadvantages, and there is no strict distinction between good and bad. Considering the proficiency, execution efficiency, ease of use, mainstream trends, and other aspects, this paper selects c# in visual.net2010 as the integrated development language [19]. In addition, in order to obtain a more beautiful and friendly interface effect, in addition to the common windows interface controls, the system development also uses the RibbonBar, Panelex, SuperGrid, and other controls in the dot net bar for windows forms control set product of the devcomponents company [20].

The database of the student information management system can be established by using Geodatabase technology. The Geodatabase is a new generation of data model and software system that uses a standard relational databases and object-oriented technology to represent, store, and manage geospatial information.

"of connections among data entities, it is also necessary to analyze the integrity constraints among entities. There are three kinds of table integrity constraints: the first is an entity integrity rule; the second is a referential integrity rule; and the third is a user-defined integrity rule. In this system, there are three kinds of integrality between entities, so as to ensure the integrality of each table. A primary key can be established on the user name in the login table, which ensures that there are no duplicate tuples in the table, thus, realizing the entity integrity. The primary key is established on the student ID in the student table to ensure that no duplicate tuples appear in the table, so that the entity integrity can be realized. Second, although the department number in the student table is not the primary key of this table, it is the primary key of the department table, so the department number can be used as the foreign key of the student table. Therefore, the department number in the student table cannot be taken casually, but can only be taken by reference to the value of the department number in the system table, thus, realizing referential integrity through the foreign key of the department number. Also, the gender field in the student table can only be \"male\" or \"female.\" This type of constraint is the so called domain integrity rule, and the domain integrity constraint is a kind of user-defined integrity.

"Also, the gender field in the student table can only be \"male\" or \"female.\" This type of constraint is the so called domain integrity rule, and the domain integrity constraint is a kind of user-defined integrity. The primary key is established on the work number in the teacher's table, which ensures that there are no duplicate tuples in the table. In this way, entity integrity can be realized through the work number.4.3. Key Algorithm Design of Distributed DatabaseDifferent from centralized database management systems, distributed databases involve issues such as data distribution and joint query of multiple data sets. In order to improve the performance of the student file management information system in data processing, it is necessary to improve the existing related data algorithms. Data distribution is a critical step in distributed databases. The mathematical description of data distribution can be defined as follows: let the data site included in the system beS, then,(1)The sites are connected to each other through the network. The set of program transactions running on this network is set toT, then,(2)As the basis for the operation of the program transaction, let the data set on the network beD, then,(3)Then, the problem that the data allocation algorithm needs to deal with is: design an algorithm to reasonably configure the replicas ofDiin different sitesS, so that the total performance of the entire system can be maximized, and the total cost can be minimized. The"
"that the data allocation algorithm needs to deal with is: design an algorithm to reasonably configure the replicas ofDiin different sitesS, so that the total performance of the entire system can be maximized, and the total cost can be minimized. The plan is denoted asC(Di,Sj,Tk).For the research on optimal data allocation algorithms, the current algorithms mainly include grouping local optimization algorithms aiming at the minimum cost of data fragmentation storage, clustering optimization algorithms implemented by calculating the minimum average value and attribute correlation-based algorithms. Vertical sharding and clustering, is an algorithm that combines clustering and allocation.Allocating data units to different clusters have better performance than direct allocation to sites, which can effectively improve communication efficiency between sites and reduce communication costs. After completing the clustering operation of the site, it is also necessary to define and clarify the communication costs between different clusters and the communication cost within each cluster.(1)If a single clusterCiincludes multiple sitesS, the average communication cost within it can be defined as follows:(4)(2)The communication cost between different clusters can be defined as follows:(5)(3)The total communication cost of all clusters in the system can be defined as follows:(6)The abovementioned definition and analysis of the communication cost within the cluster and the communication cost"
"different clusters can be defined as follows:(5)(3)The total communication cost of all clusters in the system can be defined as follows:(6)The abovementioned definition and analysis of the communication cost within the cluster and the communication cost between the clusters is the basis for the next step to optimize the distribution of data based on the genetic algorithm.4.4. Improvement of Distributed Database Query AlgorithmTo improve and optimize the distributed query algorithm, we must first determine the cost and cost calculation model of the query algorithm. Based on the research of the query process, this paper constructs a new cost model, which takes into account the factors of data copy selection, site selection, connection sequence, data transmission, and so on, and gives a mathematical model of query cost. The query cost model mainly considers the network transmission process and the total query time, and the total query cost is the sum of the query costs of all involved nodes. Consider it step by step. First, the transmission cost of data between networks can be expressed ascom(i,j,m), which means that there arembytes of data in stationsiandj. Second, the internal processing cost of the site, mainly the operation time cost of the local relational database tables.The determination of the most important fitness functions in a genetic algorithm, which is the basis for screening chromosomes.

"time cost of the local relational database tables.The determination of the most important fitness functions in a genetic algorithm, which is the basis for screening chromosomes. At present, for the distributed database query algorithm it is to find a selection scheme of sites, data copy, connection relationship, and transmission relationship, and generate a query tree to minimize the sum of costs in all aspects. The fitness function is constructed according to the cost model of distributed database queries established above. It should be noted here that genetic algorithm is implemented according to the principle of maximum fitness, the higher the probability of selection, and the cost function in the process of distributed database query should be the smaller the value, the better, so it also needs to be processed by taking the reciprocal. Therefore, the fitness function of the chromosome is(7)The training dataset is divided into several subdatasets according to the value of attributeA. The \"SplitInformation\" of attributeAis:(8)In the formula:Sis the training data set;mis the number of subdata sets; |Sj| is the number of samples in thej-th subdata set; |S| is the total number of samples in the data set before division.After the attribute a splitting step, the information gain of the sample set can be expressed as follows:(9)In the formula:E(S) is the information entropy;EA(S) is the information entropy with attributeAas the root classification.After the attributeAsplitting"

ConclusionsDriven by the Internet + education, the education industry has realized the integrated development of online and offline and obtained more practical benefits. In the process of integration and development of the two, it is not a simple overlapping development, but the Internet is used as a supporting platform and information technology is used to deepen the integration and development of interconnection and education.

"AbstractAimTo test and refine a performance-based management system to improve health worker performance in Nepal.MethodsA mixed-methods implementation research in three districts. The study assessed health workers' job satisfaction at the start and end of the study. Qualitative techniques were used to document processes, and routine health service data were analysed to measure outcomes.ResultsJob satisfaction significantly increased in six of nine key areas, and the proportion of staff absenteeism significantly declined in the study districts. It demonstrated an increase in immunisation coverage, the proportion of women who had a first antenatal check-up also having a fourth check-up and the proportion of childbirth in a health facility. The greatest perceived strengths of the system were its robust approach to performance planning and evaluation, supportive supervision, outcome-based job descriptions and a transparent reward system. A functional health facility environment, leadership and community engagement support successful implementation.ConclusionThe performance-based management system has the potential to increase health workers' job satisfaction, and it offers a tool to link facility-wide human resource management. A collaborative approach, ownership and commitment of the health system are critical to success.

"efficiency and equity1-4. A well-performing workforce is seen as essential to the success of any health system1. Many of the countries that most need to improve health care performance are also those that experience what is referred to as a 'health workforce crisis'5. In Nepal, this crisis is characterised by shortages of staff; recruitment, deployment and retention difficulties; fragmented approaches to resource planning, management and development; and poor motivation and staff performance6,7. While all of Nepal's human resource challenges affect the availability and quality of health services, the focus of this research is on improving health workers' performance. A well-performing workforce is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one in which staff are available, competent, responsive and productive1. Strategies that empower district-level health managers in Nepal to improve the performance of health workers will ultimately lead to the provision of more effective health services.In Nepal, health worker performance has drawn attention from both domestic policy-makers and international development partners as an area in which improvements should be a priority8-10. National policy documents11,12highlight poor staff performance, including productivity, quality and availability, as one of the five keyhuman resources for healthpriority areas.

"poor staff performance, including productivity, quality and availability, as one of the five keyhuman resources for healthpriority areas. While the causes of under-performance are discussed, and activities for promoting a well-performing workforce are set out, the case for further research has also been made. Little is known about what approaches and interventions are successful in developing a well-performing workforce in lower-income countries1,13. The existing evidence suggests that human resource issues vary greatly according to the local context14-16, and so contextually tailored interventions are required.In the context of needing to improve health workforce performance and a lack of evidence on 'what works', in 2009, Nepal's Ministry of Health (MoH) supported the piloting of a performance-based management system (PBMS) in Doti hill district. Learning from the pilot was used to inform the refinement of the PBMS, which was then implemented in three further districts. The objectives of our research were twofold: to assess the effectiveness of the PBMS on both health worker and service performance and to explore the processes and context that facilitate or hinder the successful implementation of the PBMS. The expected output was a tested and improved PMBS, including an implementation guide and training materials, which could be implemented more widely at district level.

"was a tested and improved PMBS, including an implementation guide and training materials, which could be implemented more widely at district level. The development of a robust, context-informed PBMS was timely in supporting districts' responses to the Government's Human Resources for Health Strategic Plan (2011-15)6.The purpose of this study was to report whether, and if so, how and why, the PBMS was able to strengthen workforce performance and improve health indicators. The study contributes to much-needed knowledge on context embedded evidence-based interventions to address human resources for health.MethodsA mixed-methods implementation research approach17was used to explore whether the PBMS improved health worker and service performance, and the factors that facilitated or hindered the PBMS's effectiveness. The iterative approach to improvement that implementation research promotes17lent itself well to refining the PBMS. Concurrent mixed methods18were used at each stage of the research process to enable understanding of multiple perspectives (i.e. district officials, health workers and community representatives), processes and outcomes.

Outcome-level indicators included service, staff and essential drug availability, and service utilisation in relation to specific maternal and child health services. Output indicators included health worker job satisfaction and staff presence. The implementation processes and technical and financial inputs were also monitored to determine whether and, if so how, they influenced the success of the PBMS.Collaborative approachConsistent with an implementation research approach, a collaborative relationship was fostered between the researchers and those overseeing and implementing the PBMS. The key objectives of collaboration were to strengthen implementers' engagement with the research, and ensure responsiveness to implementation issues and challenges. The research team consisted of individuals from the Health Research and Social Development Forum (HERD), the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and the University of Leeds (UoL). Implementation of the PBMS was overseen by central- and district-level government staff (see Fig.1).

In order to support collaboration between the researchers and implementers, members of the research team were represented on the Technical Working Group (central government level) and Performance Evaluation Committee (district level). Researchers and implementers made collaborative decisions, with implementation and research issues informing each other in an iterative and continuous manner. Collaborative activities included the joint preparation of the research protocol and decisions relating to the refinement of the PBMS.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointCommittees formed to oversee planning and implementation of the PBMS.Implementation strategyThe research took place in three distinct phases over a 28-month period.

"(within Phase 3).Detailed guidelines and tools were prepared by the Technical Working Group to support districts and facilities to implement each stage of the PBMS and to ensure consistency in implementation across districts. The Performance Evaluation Committee supported the planning, implementation and monitoring of the PBMS across districts, while each facility's HFOMC met monthly to support facility managers and staff with any implementation issues.Study areas and sitesThe three purposively selected intervention districts included a hill, mountain and plain (Terai) district to reflect Nepal's geographical and cultural diversity. The hill district, Baitadi, is in one of the remote districts in the Far Western Development Region. The mountain district, Rasuwa, is one of 16 mountain districts, approximately 120 kilometres north of Kathmandu. The plain district of Dang is located in the Terai to the south-west of Kathmandu. Rural and remote districts were included as it is particularly difficult to recruit and retain staff in these areas. Within each district, five health facilities were chosen to implement the PBMS. The facilities were selected on the basis of type (four health posts and one primary health care centre per district), performance (high-, average- and low-performing facilities represented) measured against the key indicators in the last year's district annual health review, staff vacancy rate (to ensure that recruitment and retention issues did not bias"

Facilities were selected across different electoral constituencies within each district.Data collection and recordingData collection was carried out over a 12-month period by HERD, with technical support provided by LSTM and UoL. One full-time HERD research officer was embedded in each district to ensure the robust and timely collection of data, and where possible were from or had a pre-existing relationship with that district.

Local leaders, women's groups and patients were selected as focus group discussion participants Topic guides were used to facilitate the interviews and focus group discussions. All sessions were recorded and then transcribed. Observation of the implementation process was carried out by the HERD research officers who were trained on using a structured observation guide during the study period and observations were recorded through regular visits, events and workshops, and reviewing health facility records, registers and the minutes of meetings. Research officers recorded observations by note-taking and use of a reflective diary. Observations records were verified by the HERD central research team during district monitoring visits which helped to address intra- and interobserve variation biases.Quantitative dataChanges in health worker job satisfaction were measured at the start and end of the 12-month study period. For the purposes of planning (in Phase 1), the scale of Mobindyo and colleagues18was used to estimate the required sample size. Assuming a 10% change (i.e. 3 points) is of psychological significance, the tool estimated that a sample of 280 health workers was required to complete the questionnaire at baseline, and a different sample of 280 from the same facilities 12 months later.

This sample would provide 86% power to detect a change in mean score, with an alpha level of 5%. Allowing for a 10% refusal rate, 250 analysable questionnaires would be available at both assessment times. However, on the exclusion of Rawusa (post-April 2015 earthquake), in order to gain a large enough sample at the end of the PBMS study period, all health facility staff in Baitadi and Dang were asked to complete the questionnaire.Following the piloting of the tools of Mbindyo and colleagues19and Spector and colleagues20, and further validation studies of similar tools in Nepal, the Spector questionnaire was selected to assess changes in health worker job satisfaction. The questionnaire uses 36 items to assess employee attitudes to their jobs under the areas of: pay, promotion, supervision, fringe benefits, performance-based rewards, operating procedures co-workers; nature of work and communication. There are six choices per item ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'. Items are written in both positive and negative directions.All health workers present on the day of data collection at the start and end of the 12-month study period were asked to self-complete the job satisfaction questionnaire.

Questionnaires were checked by a HERD supervisor (from the central research team) to ensure they were appropriately and fully completed. All questionnaire data were double-entered into the Census and Survey Processing System (CsPRO) and missing data and anomalies identified. Questionnaires were given a unique identifier to ensure anonymisation of data, enable robust data management, and the ability to go back to the original questionnaire if required.Routine data collectionRoutine district-level data on service utilisation were collected from Nepal's Health Management Information System (HMIS) and verified at district level as required. Drug registers were used to collect information on the availability of essential drugs. Attendance registers indicated whether staff were present, based on the day the field worker visited the facility.EthicsEthical approval to conduct the research and use the findings to inform policy and practice was obtained from both the WHO Ethics Review Committee and the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC).

Early analysis informed the refinement of the topic guides. HERD, with support from LSTM and UoL, developed the coding frameworks, and HERD research officers analysed the transcripts.Quantitative dataChecks were run on CsPRO (version 5 United States Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20230, USA) to identify missing data and any anomalies, and data were exported to SPSS (version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York 10504, USA) to carry out analysis. Levene's test for equality of variance and the independent t-test were conducted to identify any significant differences in health worker job satisfaction at the start and end of the study period.Routine data collectionFrequency tables were used to compare service utilisation in the year prior to the implementation of PBMS, and after one year of implementation.

A review of trend data from health sector annual reports over the previous five years (where available) avoided over-interpretation of data peaks.ResultsJob satisfactionA total of 264 health workers completed the job satisfaction questionnaire at the start of the study, and 325 health workers completed the questionnaire at the end. In the hill district of Baitadi, job satisfaction significantly improved in relation to at least one indicator within seven of the satisfaction domains (communications, contingent award, co-worker, fringe benefits, nature of work, operating procedure and promotion). Six of the eight indicators where improvement was demonstrated relate to positive statements, and two relate to negative statements (i.e. 'I have to work harder because of the incompetence of colleagues', and 'I have too much work to do'). In Baitadi, the only domains where no difference was seen across all indicators were 'pay' and 'supervision'. In Dang, job satisfaction increased in relation to at least one indicator in three domains (promotion, supervision and co-worker). Three of the four indicators where improvement was demonstrated in Dang relate to positive statements and one relates to a negative statement (i.e. 'supervisors have little interest in the feelings of subordinates').

"after.Perceptions on the effectiveness of PBMSA total of 16 interviews took place in each district: 10 with health workers, four with members of the HFOMC and two with district supervisors. Research officers also undertook 15 observational visits in each district over the 12-month study period. During the visits, key documents, including minutes of both staff and HFOMC meetings and availability of treatment guidelines, were reviewed.In both Dang and Baitadi, staff indicated that PBMS contributed to improved health worker performance (i.e. through improved technical skills), and that this in turn led to improvements in service provision. Interviewees linked better performance with improvements in service quality, coordination of services, resumption of some services and the attitude of service providers to both service users and the local community.'Good results have been achieved after the implementation of PBMS. For example, last year Salena Health Post was ranked in between 20th to 25th position in Baitadi. This year, it was ranked in the top five health facility. PBMS contributed to this achievement. Health facility staff set the benchmark and performance targets and allocate responsibility for all health workers with specified their activities. With successful completion of assigned activities at individual level, the institutional achievement has increased... the \"total achievement\" of the entire Baitadi District has increased by 3% this year as compared to last year."

With successful completion of assigned activities at individual level, the institutional achievement has increased... the \"total achievement\" of the entire Baitadi District has increased by 3% this year as compared to last year. It is because of this [PBMS] that it has increased'. District Supervisor discussing the impact of PBMS during an in-depth interview.In relation to performance planning and benchmarking, the majority of participants found the benchmarking process labour-intensive, but a worthwhile exercise which was necessary to inform the health facility's Annual Plan. The increased focus on benchmarking and monitoring progress supported good information management and was helpful in identifying service delivery issues more quickly and ensuring a timely response. Assigning health workers to specific actions within the Annual Plan was viewed as helpful, as it encouraged health workers to take greater ownership over specific areas of work, increased health worker accountability and generated a positive team spirit. The involvement of the HFOMC (which consists of community representatives) in the development of the Annual Plan was also seen as crucial by health workers and district supervisors. They stated that HFOMC's involvement secured the engagement of the community in identifying areas for improvement and possible solutions, and their commitment to the successful implementation of the Plan.'I personally feel and their [co-workers'] perception"
"stated that HFOMC's involvement secured the engagement of the community in identifying areas for improvement and possible solutions, and their commitment to the successful implementation of the Plan.'I personally feel and their [co-workers'] perception about benchmark setting is \"positive\". They think that it is necessary and that they have to do it anyhow. When the committee as well as all the staff sit together, discuss and set the \"benchmarking\", they feel that it won't be good if they can't fulfil the benchmark set by them. Hence, it stirs everyone at all the times to fulfil the target of the benchmarking'. Health worker in a discussion about the benchmarking aspect of PBMS during an in-depth interview.The performance monitoring and evaluation aspects of the PBMS were well received by health workers and district supervisors. The monitoring of health facilities and workers by a team of district health supervisors and community members was seen as positive, helping to pro-actively identify service delivery issues and develop local solutions. The approach was also considered to be more objective, transparent, systematic and fair compared to previous practices and systems. Staff generally appreciated that they would be assessed against a transparent set of indicators and by multiple people (rather than just one).

"against a transparent set of indicators and by multiple people (rather than just one). They said it increased their sense of responsibility, motivated them to work harder, and strengthened coordination among staff. The recognition of high-performing facilities and health workers was also seen as motivating. The involvement of service users as 'assessors' was, however, seen as problematic where service users did not have the information they required (i.e. feedback from other patients) to answer questions such as whether the healthcare professional was on time or maintained the privacy of patients.'The PBMS is quite \"systematic\" if we look at it. If anyone asks on what basis he/she has been evaluated, we can answer that it is based on so and so indicators as well as based on their job description, responsibilities, performance and satisfaction of the service users with the services provided by them.... Instead of the system of marking by one individual, the marking is done by all and average is taken. So, if there is any gap, there is a collective ownership which will motivate us to perform well'.

While some voiced concern that health workers were using the 360-degree appraisal tool to evaluate their peers on the basis of their relationship rather than performance, outcome-focussed job descriptions were seen as positive. Staff stated that they improved health worker accountability, ensured greater clarity in relation to roles and responsibilities and contributed to improvements in service delivery performance.'When the facilitator started listing all the work health facilities should do, I was surprised that the limited number of health workers are doing so much of work. The job description-making workshop helped us to understand clearly about roles and responsibilities of each of the health workers and HFOMC members'. HFOMC member in a discussion about the PBMS during an in-depth interview.Supportive supervision was seen to improve communication between district managers and health workers, and lead to more constructive feedback, recognition and praise of good work and greater commitment from health workers to improve their performance.

"to share and communicate learning on how to best improve health worker performance. These findings support the results of the job satisfaction survey that demonstrated an increase in satisfaction in relation to 'organisational communication' and 'recognition of good work'. The checklist used to support supervision was found to be particularly helpful in improving reporting and tracking progress against agreed targets. A challenge raised in relation to supportive supervision was that there were a limited number of district supervisors, which meant that they did not always have time to supervise. Some supervisors need to be better trained and equipped to carry out their work.'Before we used to be scared when there was supervision. Now, everyone gets excited when there is 'supervision'. Health workers think that the team coming for supervision will also praise their good works and they will also know about their weakness and get excited to correct them. The feedback that they[supervision team]provided has helped clarifying confusion in recording and reporting. This has also helped availability of staff'. Health facility manager discussing supportive supervision during an in-depth interview.Full implementation of the PBMS could not be completed in the mountain district of Rasuwa, which was badly affected by the earthquake of April 2015, including damage to health facilities.

"not be completed in the mountain district of Rasuwa, which was badly affected by the earthquake of April 2015, including damage to health facilities. As analysis of PBMS at the end of the study period could therefore not take place, the mountain district was excluded from the analysis.The collaborative approach that was used to support implementation of the PBMS was seen as crucial. Interviewees said that the involvement of and leadership demonstrated, at all levels of the health system (central, district and local) meant that the implementation of the PBMS was well supported and coordinated. Committee meetings (from central to local level) served as a platform for joint decision-making in relation to implementation issues and the coordination of activities, and led to timely decisions being made during the study period, for example in relation to halting the intervention in Rawusa after the 2015 earthquake. The leadership provided was also seen as crucial in engaging and gaining the commitment of managers, supervisors, health workers and members of the community to successful implementation of the PBMS.DiscussionThe PBMS has the potential to increase health worker job satisfaction, as demonstrated by the increase in satisfaction across six domains of the Spector tool.

"across six domains of the Spector tool. The relationship between the PBMS and job satisfaction is not linear, and a variety of determinants influence the satisfaction of different health workers at different times. Nevertheless, the nature of the intervention and the findings of the qualitative research make it likely that the PBMS contributed to improved satisfaction in some of the six domains, and specifically in relation to 'organisational communication', 'recognition for good work' and 'those who do well have a fair chance of promotion'. Where job satisfactiondecreasedover the study period, it is not possible to attribute these changes to the PBMS. However, because the intervention required health workers to become more accountable for achieving particular outcomes, it is likely that it contributed to health workers' perceptions that they have too much work to do. A limitation of the methodology is that two cross-sectional samples (at the start and end of the study period) were conducted rather than an individually linked survey. This was due to ethical concerns about the identification of health workers and the high turn-over of staff, although it does limit the ability of the study to demonstrate improvements inindividualjob satisfaction.Dang experienced a significant reduction in the proportion of staff not in work at the end of the PBMS implementation period, which the PBMS may have contributed by enabling conducive work environment.

"satisfaction.Dang experienced a significant reduction in the proportion of staff not in work at the end of the PBMS implementation period, which the PBMS may have contributed by enabling conducive work environment. However, as 'leave' was the main reason for staff not being at work, this could have been planned leave, which is not necessarily related to performance management.The qualitative findings of this study suggest that PBMS was helpful in improving health worker performance, and led to observe improvements in service delivery. The service utilisation data to some extent support the perceived link between improvements in health worker performance and service improvement, with some child and maternal health services experiencing an increase in utilisation. However, there were also reductions in service utilisation for some indicators, and while it is unlikely that PBMS contributed to these reductions (as Annual Plans set targets for improvements across these areas), the reasons for this should be explored. There were also limitations with the service utilisation data; not all the health facilities properly managed all the recording and reporting systems, and some of the data were of poor quality, which led to its exclusion. This situation limited the assessment of service utilisation to maternal and child health indicators only. One of the lessons learned is that bringing about change in the performance of health workers, and subsequently service performance, requires"
"This situation limited the assessment of service utilisation to maternal and child health indicators only. One of the lessons learned is that bringing about change in the performance of health workers, and subsequently service performance, requires considerable time and resources. Future research should allow for a longer evaluation period so that any changes may be better identified. This would also enable a wider range of performance indicators (and potentially confounding factors) to be measured and included in the analysis. The mixed picture in relation to essential medicines makes it difficult to identify whether or not the PBMS had an impact on drug availability.A number of processes and inputs need to be in place for the PBMS to be implemented successfully. Job satisfaction and the performance of health workers are directly linked with the enabling environment where they work. The health facility environment should therefore be functional, with (as a minimum) key posts filled, basic physical facilities and a reliable and timely supply of essential medicines. A collaborative approach with central, district and local level leadership is also very important for the successful implementation and sustainability of the PBMS. Central government commitment and leadership through good governance arrangements (i.e. the Steering Committee) were found to be invaluable in ensuring that the PBMS was implemented across multiple health facilities and districts, and in a coordinated"
"Central government commitment and leadership through good governance arrangements (i.e. the Steering Committee) were found to be invaluable in ensuring that the PBMS was implemented across multiple health facilities and districts, and in a coordinated and sustainable way. At the same time, the involvement of the HFOMC at the health facility level (i.e. in setting targets, developing annual and improvement plans) helped to secure local ownership of the PBMS and the active participation of staff and community members. These findings support those of Dieleman and colleagues13who cite the involvement of local authorities, communities and management, and active involvement of local staff to identify and implement solutions to problems, as critical in the successful implementation of human resource interventions.A number of contextual factors influenced the effectiveness of the PBMS, and help to explain why it may have been more effective in some health facilities than others. A nationwide health worker strike from December 2014 to January 2015 led to delays in training staff on the PBMS at the health facility level across all districts. Frequent transfers of staff to and from some health facilities also affected the delivery of planned activities, as new staff did not have adequate knowledge about the PBMS. Those health facilities with a workforce that was more informed about and committed to implementing the PBMS tended to be those that were higher-performing by the end of the"
"planned activities, as new staff did not have adequate knowledge about the PBMS. Those health facilities with a workforce that was more informed about and committed to implementing the PBMS tended to be those that were higher-performing by the end of the study period. PBMS guideline clearly states six broad key areas and specific indicators for evaluation of each health facility performance. Targets were set for each indicator at the beginning of the fiscal year which were measured at the end of fiscal year to determine the performance level of health facilities. These were also where key elements of the PBMS were working well; particularly the annual performance management process, supportive supervision and group performance appraisal (at facility and individual level). Critical to these elements working well were the provision of technical support from central and district government, especially in benchmark setting and performance evaluation. The availability of well-trained supervisors to participate in supportive supervision was also key.The greatest strengths of the PBMS were perceived to be its robust approach to performance planning and evaluation, supportive supervision and feedback, outcome-based job descriptions and a fair and transparent reward system. Staff felt that all of these components led to improvements in their performance. This study therefore supports the link between supportive supervision and reward systems and improved performance2.

"and a fair and transparent reward system. Staff felt that all of these components led to improvements in their performance. This study therefore supports the link between supportive supervision and reward systems and improved performance2. As less is known about the links between performance planning and evaluation and health worker performance, this study provides a useful insight into how one can inform the other.The implementation research approach was invaluable in enabling discussion and decision-making to take place, which informed the refinement of the PBMS model and the research process. The governance structure formed to oversee the planning and implementation of PBMS (Fig.1) played an important role in ensuring that there was a space where such discussion and decision-making could take place. It also ensured the coming together of both policy-makers and researchers periodically over the study period. The identification of a governance approach that supports policy formulation and implementation is of importance given that governance has been a neglected issue in the field of human resources for health22,23. The active involvement of the MoH and WHO (i.e. on the Steering Committee and Technical Advisory Group) also meets Rowe and colleagues'14call for greater national government and international organisation involvement in helping to translate research findings into action to improve health worker performance.

"also meets Rowe and colleagues'14call for greater national government and international organisation involvement in helping to translate research findings into action to improve health worker performance. The focus on process, and how and why the PBMS was working well or not, also enabled identification of linkages between human resource management, performance and implementation, which little research has attempted or been able to address24.ConclusionsImproving health service performance demands a collective effort of individual health workers and facility management committee. In the light of the challenges relating to health worker performance across Nepal, a contextually tailored PBMS that has both demonstrated potential, and which can be implemented in a range of contexts, is helpful. Key advantages of the PBMS are that it offers a processes and tools to link facility-wide human resource management with improvement in health workers satisfaction thus leading to improved performance. Various actors of district health system and health facility and prevailing local context determine implementation of PBMS and its impact in improving health facility performance. Critical to its success are leadership and commitment to its implementation by those at all levels of the health system.

This includes a commitment to make available the human resources and expertise that can ensure ongoing monitoring, supervision and performance improvement activities. Ideally, the PBMS should be integrated with other human resource programmes, as part of ongoing good practice.This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of implementation research in testing and refining interventions in a way which maximises collaboration between the researchers and implementers at each stage of the research process.AcknowledgementsThe following persons have contributed to this research: Anayda Portela, Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, World Health Organization Geneva; Deepak Joshi, Sangeeta Khimbanjar, Sumedha Rajbanshi, and Madan Bhatta of Health Research and Social Development; Sudeepa Khanal, Senior Researcher and Dr Ghanashyam Gautam, Health Economist, from HERD International, Nepal; Dr Bal Krishna Suvedi, Public Health Expert, Nepal; Ministry of Health, Nepal; District Public Health Offices, Health Institutions and Health Workers of Baitadi, Dang and Rasuwa districts.Conflict of InterestNone.FundingThis study was funded by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, with support from the Norwegian Government Agency for Development Cooperation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the United Kingdom Department for International Development.References1World"

"AbstractIn order to improve the student management effect of private colleges and universities, this paper combines geographic information system and WIFI to construct a private college student management system. In the structural design, this paper divides the platform into several modules according to the idea of modularization and narrates the function of each part. In the database design, this paper completes the construction of each function of the platform. In the process design, this paper determines the design process of the platform. Finally, this paper studies the key technologies involved in the system and evaluates students' trajectory positioning and management effects in colleges and universities. The research shows that the student management system of private colleges and universities based on geographic information system and WIFI proposed in this paper can effectively improve the student management effect of private colleges and universities.1. IntroductionAs an important part of China's higher education, private colleges and universities have played a huge role in talent training. In recent years, private colleges and universities have made remarkable achievements, but since private education is still in the stage of development, there are inevitably some problems. In this case, it is necessary for the relevant personnel to strengthen the analysis and research on these problems and find out the solution to the problem.The administrators of colleges and"
"in the stage of development, there are inevitably some problems. In this case, it is necessary for the relevant personnel to strengthen the analysis and research on these problems and find out the solution to the problem.The administrators of colleges and universities should formulate a management system in line with the current situation of the school and make continuous adjustments to deal with changes in the school situation. In the selection of counselors, young teachers who are optimistic and have a serious work attitude should be selected. These teachers have just been put into teaching positions, and they are of the same age as the students. The generation gap is small, which facilitates the formation of a friendly relationship between teachers and students and facilitates the instructor to understand the students' situation in a timely manner and conduct effective management. In the teacher training plan, on-the-job training for teachers is carried out regularly to guide teachers to actively improve teaching methods and teaching methods, so as to create a lively and interesting classroom. At the same time, it is necessary to maximize students' learning efficiency, stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning, transform classroom roles, turn students into classroom masters, realize autonomous learning, and effectively improve learning ability [1]. The faculty team of private colleges and universities is constantly growing, and many scholars and professors often come to"
"classroom roles, turn students into classroom masters, realize autonomous learning, and effectively improve learning ability [1]. The faculty team of private colleges and universities is constantly growing, and many scholars and professors often come to private colleges to give lectures to students, broadening students' horizons, which is of great significance for the improvement of students' overall quality. Moreover, the student management work of private colleges directly determines the social reputation of private colleges and universities, and a good style of study is an important means to attract students. Therefore, exploring a path that is in line with the development of private colleges and universities is the best choice to solve the problem of student management [2]. College administrators should put student management on the agenda and focus on solving them and strengthen the quantitative management of students and the management of daily behavioral norms. In addition, private colleges and universities should strengthen the construction of teachers' teams, improve teachers' professional quality and professionalism, improve teaching quality and teaching level, strengthen students' safety management and behavior development education, and create a good learning environment. At the same time, it is necessary to teach students according to their aptitude according to their behavioral characteristics, to cultivate outstanding talents for national construction, to"
"development education, and create a good learning environment. At the same time, it is necessary to teach students according to their aptitude according to their behavioral characteristics, to cultivate outstanding talents for national construction, to further achieve the goal of rejuvenating the country through education, and to lay a solid foundation for China's future economic and social construction [3].Quantitative management methods have been widely used in the management of students in private colleges and universities in my country and gradually formed a work pattern with quantitative management as the main line. The application of quantitative management methods is conducive to the scientific and standardization of student management work, which makes student management work well-founded and rule-based, and to a certain extent changes the chaotic state of randomness, head-scratching, and poor results in previous management work. It reduces the difficulty and cost of management and plays a good role in promoting students to develop the habit of self-education and self-management [4]. However, in the quantitative management of students, especially in the quantitative management of students in private undergraduate colleges, people often ignore a theoretical premise, which is the thinking on human nature. Workers engaged in management in enterprises or other fields unconsciously apply the theories of \"human nature is good,\" \"human nature is evil,\" \"economic man"
