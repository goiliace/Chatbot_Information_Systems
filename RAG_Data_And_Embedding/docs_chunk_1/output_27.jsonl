"of two user groups with specific unmet SRH needs: women and adolescents. In total, four advisory user committees were implemented in three sanitary zones (Makala (WUC), Maluku II (WUC and AUC) and Kasa-Vubu (AUC)), encompassing several health centres. At the time of this study, three groups were still in operation, the latter currently dissolved because of the insecurity in this zone of Kinshasa (AUC Maluku II). This case study focuses on the three user committees still in function.Using Donabedian's healthcare quality conceptual model (structure, processes and outcomes29) to guide our analysis, this study seeks to explore the implementation factors and the results of the introduction of women (WUC) and adolescents (AUC) committees in primary healthcare facilities in Kinshasa, DRC. More specifically, it aims to:Explore the WUC and AUC structures, such as its composition and representation, learning and leadership (roles and responsibilities) [Structure];Describe the activities planned that were or weren't implemented by the committees [Processes];Identify the contributing factors and challenges in user committee's implementation and operations to facilitate the implementation of WUC and AUC in similar contexts [Processes];Describe the effects of the implementation of WUC and AUC at the individual (committee members), organisational (primary healthcare facilities) and community levels [Outcomes].2.4 Data collectionWith the aim of enhancing the quality of results through"
"the effects of the implementation of WUC and AUC at the individual (committee members), organisational (primary healthcare facilities) and community levels [Outcomes].2.4 Data collectionWith the aim of enhancing the quality of results through triangulation of approaches,30this study employed a mixed-method case study design. The quantitative component of this study utilised secondary data taken from the Ministry of Health's health management information system, the (DHIS2), that's currently used in more than 80 low-to middle-income countries. In DRC, routine data on key health zone indicators are collected at the health facilities in each zone, before being transmitted to the health zone coordinator at the end of the reporting period. The data reported are then entered into the National Health Information System, the DRC's national DHIS2 platform for health information management for each health zones. Data entry and quality control is mostly done in the health zones, with data completion rate routinely exceeding the 80% benchmark.Qualitative data was collected through two research World Cafes. Regarded as a 'circulating focus group', World Cafe is an explorative qualitative data collection methodology that gathers multiple stakeholders around a limited number of questions each covering a dimension of a research topic.31As an alternative to traditional group discussions, World Cafe is seen as a participative and inclusive data collection methodology enabling quality data to"

Participants consisted of stakeholders directly involved in the implementation of WUC and AUC, such as members of the user committees, community animators and relays, and representatives of the health centres, of health related and educational programs and of CODESA/CODEVs and COCODEVs representatives (see Table1Description of participants per World Cafe). Themes covered included facilitating factors and obstacles of user committees' implementation and operations, and perceived impact at the individual, organisational and community levels. After welcoming and introducing the facilitators and workshop objectives and questions, participants were asked to divide into groups of up to 10 people and get seated at the various tables.

"and get seated at the various tables. Each table designated a 'table host' who could write, and who was responsible for documenting on the table's summary sheet the conversations related to each of the questions posed. This was followed by rounds of conversation lasting 20 min, each focusing on a specific question or theme. After each round, participants were asked to change tables (half going to the table on their left, the other half to their right), with only the 'table host' staying still. Before the start of the next round, the 'table host' presented the answers given by the participants to questions and themes already addressed and asked the round of participants if they wanted to add any contributions to what had been presented. At the end of the rounds, an 'harvesting' phase allowed participants to share with the rest of the group the main results for each of the questions and themes and try to collectively identify similarities and trends.

Qualitative data was analysed using Miles, Huberman et Saldana's three-steps thematic analysis: data condensation, presentation, and formulation/validation.33Qualitative data were coded manually using inductive coding, and codes were categorised using Donabedian's Structure-Process-Results framework. To increase rigour and trustworthiness, data condensation was completed in two phases.

Secondly, the raw material from the World Cafe (e.g. each table's written summary) was reanalysed by an expert from Montreal University. The results from both analyses were triangulated and then validated with facilitators of the World Cafe to increase validity through confirmation.3 RESULTSThe following section highlights the main results of our study according to Donabedian's quality of care model level of analysis: structure, processes, and results.273.1 StructureEach user committee were made up of two structures: an executive committee composed of all committee members, and a six-person management committee elected from the executive committee members. Table2(below) highlights the main characteristics of the WUC and AUC committees. The WUC executive committee was made up of women representatives of groups and associations in the sanitary area and who were or have used the SRH services of the associated health centre (see Table3, below for composition). The management committee was elected from the WUC members, with at least two of them literate either in French or in their native language (reading and writing).

"in French or in their native language (reading and writing). Because the members of the executive committee sat as representatives of their organisations or associations, a general assembly, which was open to all associative members, completed the WUC structure. As for AUC, both its committees were made up of an equal number of male and female students between the ages of 15 and 20 who attended the partner schools and had been trained in SRHR or who acted as peer educators. The relationship between user committees and CODESA/CODEVs was also formalised to foster better communication between stakeholders, as the Presidents of CODESA/CODEVs were expected to attend all user committee meetings, and vice-versa.TABLE  2.Women and adolescent user committees' structure characteristics and composition.Women user committee (WUC)Adolescent user committee (AUC)Sanitary zoneMakalaMaluku IIKasa-VubuImplementation dateMar 2021Mar 2021Sep 2022Committee structureExecutive committeeExecutive committeeManagement committeeManagement committeeGeneral assembly*Admissibility criteriaLive in the sanitary zone concernedBe a member of a community animation cell or a community-based organisationBe a woman who uses or has used sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and respects her appointments at the healthcare centreBe at least 18 years oldAgree to be a volunteerBe available for the committee operating activities and implementation of the annual action planBe a student at the school concernedBe"

User committee members were then responsible for drawing up their own rules of procedure, which defined the objectives, composition, and powers of the committee; specified the rights and duties of its members; defined the duration and operation (activities) of the committee; and clarified its conflict resolution mechanism, including disciplinary measures and the possibility of sanctions. Both Women and AUC's main aim was patient advocacy, such as raise awareness of SRHR and advocate for better quality SRH services, adapted to their needs, in the partnering healthcare facilities.

"facilities. At the time of their creation, AUC also aimed at supporting the monitoring and evaluation of SRH services for adolescents and youth clientele, by attending the monthly monitoring committee meetings implemented by the partner healthcare facilities. The WUC and AUC management committees met monthly and aimed to be self-sustaining, although their first action plans were funded by the project (see financing, Table2).3.2 ProcessesAdvocacy user committee processes could be divided into two phases: an implementation (preparatory) phase and an operational phase. The World Cafe allowed to identify several facilitators and obstacles that have influenced either the user committees' implementation phase, and/or their operational phase (see Table4for main themes).TABLE  4.Women and adolescent user committees' main implementation and operational facilitators and obstacles.Women user committeeAdolescent user committeeFacilitatorsImplementation phasePre-existence of women's associationsAdvocacy with main stakeholders (traditional leaders, and health and education stakeholders)SHR trainingAssociative management trainingAdvocacy with main stakeholders (traditional leaders, and health and education stakeholders)Awareness-raising of AUC among peer-educatorsApproval of parents and school authoritiesOperational phaseMembers' availabilitySupport and coaching of main stakeholders (community, traditional and religious leaders and healthcare stakeholders)Members' availabilitySupport and"

"zones. Stakeholders involved included the management team of the sanitary zone (SZ) central office, the head nurse of the health centre and/or the head doctor when the health centre were medicalised, representatives of the provincial health division, the COCODEV and CODESA/CODEV committees and political, administrative, customary, and religious authorities. User committee focal points were then identified to be involved in all stages of the process and act as reference points for members. Lastly, workshops were conducted with women and adolescents interested in joining the committees to share benefits and best practices in advocacy user committee implementation. Results from the group discussion indicated that these activities have not only raised awareness of the initiative but have also encouraged community support and buy-in, particularly in terms of securing parents and school authorities' consent. Furthermore, they raised awareness of the benefits of advocacy user committees among potential members, such as peer-educators.More specific to WUCs, the pre-existence of women's associations and the proximity between its members of and the community, as they were themselves users of the health services, were also highlighted as factors facilitating the establishment of user committees.The community trusts the WUCs being residents of the health areas, they express themselves easily.(WUC ID1)As for AUC, all World Cafe participants stressed the importance of the training"
"as factors facilitating the establishment of user committees.The community trusts the WUCs being residents of the health areas, they express themselves easily.(WUC ID1)As for AUC, all World Cafe participants stressed the importance of the training received in the successful implementation of committees, both in relation to SRHR and to committee management.Although the implementation phase was generally perceived as positive, a number of obstacles were raised. Interestingly, obstacles to setting up user committees differed for women and adolescents user committees. In the case of WUCs, the obstacles raised concerned the members themselves, notably their ability to express themselves in public, and internal conflicts within the groups. While WUC members stressed that being part of a community association was facilitating, many members had great difficulty at first in speaking up and expressing themselves even with this prior experience. Moreover, the fact that the members represented the women's associations from which they came led to conflict in relation to the WUC's governance structure. For example, a member organisation wanted to have a say in the management of one of the WUC, requiring the clarification of the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders around the committee's governance. WUC members also complained of potential conflict of interests arising from the fact that one of the members was both a member of an association and a staff of one of the health centres,"
"responsibilities of stakeholders around the committee's governance. WUC members also complained of potential conflict of interests arising from the fact that one of the members was both a member of an association and a staff of one of the health centres, hence stressing the need to clarify the membership admissibility criteria. Other membership admissibility criteria were also called into question, such as the member's financial contribution. Despite being seen as a key factor in the sustainability of committees, the member's financial contribution was perceived as a major barrier to participating in activities, especially for adolescents who often lacked personal income.With regard to the AUC, stakeholders pointed out that teenagers' absence of experience in associative life was an obstacle to the implementation of user committees, particularly in the development of constitutive texts and action plans. In addition, parents' initial misperception of the committees was raised, although this was more associated with the themes addressed than with the idea of the youth association as such. In fact, although parental consent was seen as a facilitating factor for the implementation of AUCs, the taboos surrounding teenager's sexuality remained a barrier not only to the implementation of UAC but also to their operational activities, as described below.3.2.2 Operational phaseOnce the implementation phase was completed and the advisory user committees were formalised, executive"
"sexuality remained a barrier not only to the implementation of UAC but also to their operational activities, as described below.3.2.2 Operational phaseOnce the implementation phase was completed and the advisory user committees were formalised, executive committee members were asked to draft an action plan (1-2 years). Operational activities of committees associated with WUC and AUC missions were twofold. On one side, committee members (executive and management,n= 117 in total) were asked to participate in activities to raise awareness on SRH. These included participation in radio programs (n= 210) and facilitating community activities (n= 40) promoting the use of SRH services available in the healthcare centres. Furthermore, AUC organised two conferences on the theme of risky behaviours among teenagers and young people, attended by close to two hundred teenagers. One of AUC's greatest strengths was its \"ease of reaching more adolescents and young people in different parts [of the area]\" (AUC, ID3). AUC members not only promoted services, but also accompanied adolescents to health centres, when necessary, thereby increasing adolescents' and young people's access to SRH services. As for WUC, during their awareness-raising and information activities, members collected patient complaints about the SHR services provided by the health centres, which were then forwarded to the CODESA/CODEVs at their monthly meetings, and to the healthcare professionals of the health centres"
"and information activities, members collected patient complaints about the SHR services provided by the health centres, which were then forwarded to the CODESA/CODEVs at their monthly meetings, and to the healthcare professionals of the health centres (tri-monthly meeting). If complaints have not been resolved at this level, they were escalated to the authorities at the zone/communal level. Once the corrective actions have been implemented, WUC then monitored community satisfaction with the response to complaints to ensure feedback from beneficiaries.On the other side, management committee members participated in bi-monthly consultation meetings with key stakeholders, including members of the healthcare facilities, to advocate for improved quality care and access improvement. In addition, AUC members visited health facilities to carry out an audit of the quality and range of services offered to adolescents, including the quality of reception and the cleanliness of facilities. The points for improvement highlighted in the audit report were used to identify the capacity-building needs specific to the facilities, and to guide a range of training courses and workshops (PNSA intervention package, hygiene and biomedical waste management, family planning, etc.). As for the participation of AUC in the monitoring and evaluation of SDSR services, this objective was not achieved as the health centre monitoring committee was temporarily discontinued due to lack of funding.In terms of"
"family planning, etc.). As for the participation of AUC in the monitoring and evaluation of SDSR services, this objective was not achieved as the health centre monitoring committee was temporarily discontinued due to lack of funding.In terms of the user committees' operations, facilitators like those previously identified for the implementation phase were mentioned. The availability of members, the dynamism of association leaders and the support of stakeholders from the community, health and educational structures were highlighted as main facilitators of user committees' activities. In addition, the financial and technical support, mainly through the basic training courses, was raised as a factor facilitating the operational activities of the user committees. Several obstacles were nevertheless raised as having hindered the operational activities of the established hay committees. From an operational point of view, the committees' poor logistical resources were raised for both WUCs and AUCs, particularly with regard to the lack of adequate and/or dedicated space for holding meetings and storing documents.Bad weather, rain and sun prevent the meeting from taking place. [We need] a shed for our protection. [There is] no room to store our equipment.(WUC ID5)Despite prior awareness-raising efforts, one of the main obstacles to carrying out the committee's activities was the resistance from certain community stakeholders, particularly from traditional leaders and from members of"
"to store our equipment.(WUC ID5)Despite prior awareness-raising efforts, one of the main obstacles to carrying out the committee's activities was the resistance from certain community stakeholders, particularly from traditional leaders and from members of health and education centres. All participants from both WUCs and AUCs also stressed that the current climate of instability, particularly with regard to inter-ethnic conflicts and street gangs in some parts of Kinshasa, has been a major barrier to carrying out their activities.Both WUC and AUC members also highlighted that the limited choice of members in view of the eligibility criteria laid down in the by-laws, particularly for the election of officers, was a barrier in the realisation of the committees' activities. Despite understanding the importance of female adolescent's engagement on the committee, some of the AUC participants questioned the need for an equitable gender quota for the various executive positions, believing instead that competence should be the sole criterion for selection. Likewise, the requirement of belonging to an associative group in order to join the WUC was also seen as a barrier to women as individuals who were interested in the activities of the committee but could not join because they were not members of a women's association. Finally, the low participation and attendance of adolescents committee members was identified as a barrier to the implementation of activities for the UAC (62.5% vs."
"the committee but could not join because they were not members of a women's association. Finally, the low participation and attendance of adolescents committee members was identified as a barrier to the implementation of activities for the UAC (62.5% vs. 100% for WUC). According to participants of the AUC World Cafe, this could be partly explained by the adolescents' limited free time because of their studies and by the discomfort some of them still feel in discussing SRH issues, particularly with their peers.3.3 OutcomesAnalysis of data collected through the World Cafes and of secondary data drawn from health centre and DHIS2 databases revealed that the implementation of user committees has had a significant impact not only on committee members (individual) and partner health centres (organisational), but also on communities (see main outcomes per level - Table5below).

Analysis of the two World Cafes highlighted two themes related to the results of implementing user committees at the individual level, namely: (1) an increase in knowledge and competencies; (2) development of professional skills; (3) development of soft skills, and (4) empowerment of user committee members.Increase in knowledge and competenciesWUC and AUC committee members alike mentioned, among other things, the acquisition of new knowledge, particularly about SRH and available SRH services, and awareness of their SRHR."
"of user committee members.Increase in knowledge and competenciesWUC and AUC committee members alike mentioned, among other things, the acquisition of new knowledge, particularly about SRH and available SRH services, and awareness of their SRHR. What's more, the committees were seen as a way for users to speak out and freely express their opinions about their SRHR.[AUC is] a space for adolescents and young people to express themselves without fear or taboos about sexuality, and to voice their opinions and concerns.(AUC, ID3)Development of professional skillsParticipants also mentioned that user committee members had developed professional knowledge and skills, particularly in organisational and financial management, which could be transferred to their professional and personal fields.On leadership, we've also become family leaders.(WUC ID1)Development of soft skillsFurthermore, members fetl that through their participation in the advisory users' committees they have developed their \"soft skills\" such as their leadership, self-confidence and ability to speak in public and \"the courage [...] to speak out.\" (WUC ID5)We've developed self-control and self-confidence.

The majority of facilities do not take needs into consideration.(AUC ID3)All the participants emphasised the fruitful collaboration between the committees and the CODESA/CODEVs and COCODEVs, which is perceived to have improved access for women and adolescents to quality services tailored to their needs.

"collaboration between the committees and the CODESA/CODEVs and COCODEVs, which is perceived to have improved access for women and adolescents to quality services tailored to their needs. This perception is supported by the fact that all complaints related to quality or access of SRH services reported to CODESA/CODEV and the healthcare centre authorities by the WUC have been resolved (ASSK 2024).The feedback loop between beneficiaries and health centres, combined with the user committee's activities, was perceived to have led to many improvements. Analysis of the World Cafe revealed two themes related to the results of implementing user committees at the organisational level, namely 1) improved access to quality SHR services adapted to women and adolescents' needs, and 2) increased integration of healthcare services.Improved access to quality SHR servicesParticipants emphasised the change in behaviour of health centre providers, particularly with regard to improving reception, respect for patients' rights and confidentiality. The WUC's intervention has also led to the disclosure of fees to combat overbilling, as well as lower fees for certain procedures (childbirth, caesarean section, ovarian cyst surgery, appendicitis). Other improvements have been made to the health centres infrastructure, particularly in terms of sanitation.

"improvements have been made to the health centres infrastructure, particularly in terms of sanitation. For example, the mattresses at one of the centres were replaced, as they were worn out, and boreholes were installed to facilitate access to potable water. The lights in the delivery rooms have also been upgraded to better meet patients' needs.In addition, the WUC's intervention has led to the introduction of SRH services provided by female providers, thus minimising the barrier of customs and traditions against male providers. It has also enabled health centre opening hours to be adapted to meet women's needs, particularly those of a more advanced age, who felt uncomfortable attending SRH consultations with younger women, as well as low-income women, all of whom expressed the need to be seen outside normal opening hours.[There was] refusal on the part of some women to attend the health centre together with the others for lack of quality clothes. In response, the schedule was changed to favour even the poor.(WUC ID3)Similarly, as WUC, AUC members emphasised their impression of bringing about a change in decision-making and in the planning and monitoring of health services adapted to adolescents.Adolescents are put at the centre of decision-making and health services that concern them. They participate fully in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of health services that concern them.(AUC ID1)AUCs members also perceived that the initiative has 'enabled innovation in"
"the centre of decision-making and health services that concern them. They participate fully in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of health services that concern them.(AUC ID1)AUCs members also perceived that the initiative has 'enabled innovation in adolescent health services'. (AUC ID4) However, participants highlighted that there are still several challenges to be overcome, as 'SRH care is not provided effectively and [issues subsist] such as consultation, out-of-pocket expenses, reception and confidentiality.' (AUC ID2).Increased integration of healthcare servicesFurthermore, WUCs have enabled better integration of pre and post-natal consultations, childbirth, family planning and vaccination services. Finally, to ensure comprehensive SRH services while limiting patient transfers, a request was made to provide one of the health centres with an ultrasound machine.3.3.3 Community levelLastly, the implementation of user committees is perceived by participants to have had a significant impact at the community level. Analysis of the World Cafes has highlighted two themes related to the results of implementing user committees at the community level, namely: 1) healthier SRH behaviours, and 2) increase of women engagement in their SHR.Healthier SHRH behavioursThe implementation of advocacy user committees seems to have fostered awareness and the adoption of better health habits and behaviours by community members, not only in terms of community members adopting healthy SRH"
"in their SHR.Healthier SHRH behavioursThe implementation of advocacy user committees seems to have fostered awareness and the adoption of better health habits and behaviours by community members, not only in terms of community members adopting healthy SRH behaviours such as modern family planning, but also in terms of the reduction of risky behaviours such as drug and alcohol use.[Before] it was difficult to accept planning in Mbankana because of rumours in the community about the effects of implants on the body(WUC ID2).This seems to have led to an increase in the number of patients seeking care at our health centres, as \"the health centre was 30% occupied, now it's 80% [occupied]\" (WUC ID1). These perceptions seem to be corroborated by DHIS2 data, which show a marked increase in family planning consultations and assisted deliveries among women aged 15-49 in user committee intervention zones (see Table6, below).TABLE  6.Main outcome indicators relating to SHR per sanitary zone, 2022-2024.MakalaMaluku IIPercentage of women and adolescent girls that use SRH services (yearly)73.6%56%Baseline: 12%Baseline: 35%613% increase160% increasePercentage of women and adolescents that have an assisted delivery32%56%Baseline: 10%Baseline: 50%320% increase12% increasePercentage of women and adolescents using family planning services8.5%16%Baseline: 3%Baseline: 13%283% increase23% increaseSource: DHIS2.These significant impacts were also observed in adolescents and youth of the community"

Ignorance is removed in relation to sexual and reproductive health. [...] Now teenagers are aware of their sexual and reproductive health problems, and we're working to raise their awareness and change their behaviours, learning how to wear condoms correctly, how to calculate their menstrual cycle and how girls use [contraceptive] pills [and] reducing the use of psychoactive substances among adolescents and young people.(AUC, ID2).This strategy seems to have paid off. Overall, an 19% increase in new family-planning services users in adolescents was observed in the period under review.AUC has given us access to sexual and reproductive health services. Before, there was limited knowledge.(AUC, ID6)Apart from HC Sainte-Marie, the number of new teenagers accepting contraceptive methods has almost doubled among the partnering health centres. Furthermore, a 34,5% reduction in STI-related new consultations of adolescents 15-24 years of age was observed in the Kaza-Vubu SZ.

It should be noted, however, that this impact is most likely attributable to the combination of the AUC's SRH awareness-raising activities and the free STI treatment campaign carried out the previous year by the project.Increase in women of the community's engagement in their SHRUltimately, the implementation of advisory user committees seems to have led to an increase in women and adolescents' engagement in their SDSR. As stated by one of the participants:The WUCs are a success factor for women's joint participation, as women are the pillars of the community, and it's through them that we can have everyone's assent. [...] With the WUC, women were able to say out loud what they had been saying in silence. With WUC, the search for equity became effective.(WUC ID2)4 DISCUSSIONThis study aimed to explore advocacy user committees of under-represented or marginalised groups such as adolescents and women in their ability to foster greater patient engagement, and by extent increasing access to quality care adapted to their needs, in a Sub-Saharan context. Our results highlighted that the implementation of WUC and AUC in DRC has had significant impacts at the individual, organisational and community level.

"had significant impacts at the individual, organisational and community level. At the individual level, implementation of user committees was identified with an increase of SRH knowledge and competencies, of professional knowledge and soft skills and of empowerment of the user committee members. In addition, at the organisational level, WUCs and AUCs seem to have improved access to quality care adapted to patients' need, and of certain modalities of SRH services. Finally, at the community level, they were associated with an increase of the SRH literacy and of patient engagement of women and adolescents of their community. These findings corroborate those of Haddad et al.34who estimated that 15 additional assisted deliveries could be attributed to the presence of WUCs in the three zones of the project in Burkina Faso and Mali. They also support other studies' conclusions in Sub-Saharan contexts that found that community and patient engagement positively influence use of healthcare services and health outcomes.6,35,36Our study also questioned the ability of user committees to empower patient engagement in the individual care level in contexts where medical paternalism is prominent. Overall, our results seem to indicate that the implementation of advocacy user committees have led to greater patient engagement at the episode of care level, as illustrated by an increased ease of women and adolescent patients to express their SRH needs and opinions regarding services offered.

"implementation of advocacy user committees have led to greater patient engagement at the episode of care level, as illustrated by an increased ease of women and adolescent patients to express their SRH needs and opinions regarding services offered. Yet the extent of this engagement in the context of care episodes with the providers themselves (i.e informed consent, participation in care, patient autonomy, etc.) and its effects needs to be further explored.Several facilitating factors and obstacles that will need to be considered when setting up user committees in similar contexts in the future were also identified. The fact that WUC members were already involved in associations and organisations was raised as a facilitating factor, echoing prior WUC implementation initiatives in Haiti, Burkina Faso and Mali, where the importance of existing leadership among members was also noted.37,38In line with Ankhoma and al.,14our study also highlights the importance of community healthcare workers support and collaboration, that were perceived critical to effective patient engagement initiatives success such as in user committee's implementation and operations. Our results furthermore reinforce the necessity of taking into account the important influence of key traditional and religious stakeholders and involving them not only in the preparatory phases but also in the activities of advocacy user committees in Sub-Saharan contexts.Ultimately, this study also raises the question of"
"the important influence of key traditional and religious stakeholders and involving them not only in the preparatory phases but also in the activities of advocacy user committees in Sub-Saharan contexts.Ultimately, this study also raises the question of representation and representativeness. As advocacy users' committees, the aim of WUC and AUC was to act as transmission belts and spokespersons for women and adolescents vis-à-vis the health centres and health system stakeholders. Hence the committee's membership inclusion criteria requiring current or previous use of services and a minimum level of knowledge of SRH. In addition, to make medical documentation easier to understand, the WUC required a proportion of its executive members to be able to read and write in French. This need for basic literacy (general or medical) is believed to be one of the main factors facilitating the setting up and operation of committees, in line with the findings cited in the literature.35However, this raises a concern about potential representativeness bias between the composition of the committees and that of the populations in the DRC's health zones, where one out of five men and two out of five women aged 15-49 years cannot read a short simple statement.39This representativeness bias is all the more prevalent among teenagers whose members had to attend school to be able to join the AUC, considering the low rates of school attendance in DRC (in 2007, youth school attendance rates was 27% of"
"statement.39This representativeness bias is all the more prevalent among teenagers whose members had to attend school to be able to join the AUC, considering the low rates of school attendance in DRC (in 2007, youth school attendance rates was 27% of 12-17 years old for all of the DRC, but as low as 56% for Kinshasa). These concerns about the limitations of direct patient engagement methods such as user committees in regard to representativeness have also been raised by Crawford and Rutter,40and Sandman et al., the latter going as far as to state that 'in practice, patient representation in [the basis of deliberative democracy] is likely to be impossible, and any attempt to implement it risks being biased towards some stakeholders at the expense of others',41p. 409. However, we agree with Scolz et al. that 'representation itself is not the end goal but is rather a means to ensuring decision-making and agenda-setting in health systems is held more equitably',42p. 8.4.1 LimitationsDespite efforts to ensure the validity of the results, notably through data triangulation, certain limitations remain. One limitation is the short time elapsed between implementation of the committees and evaluation of their impact. This raises questions about the sustainability of its effects, especially once funding for the pilot project is no longer available.

"about the sustainability of its effects, especially once funding for the pilot project is no longer available. Regarding secondary data, potential biases include the variable quality of data related to SRH services rendered, the limited number of health data collected, and the lack of age-disaggregated data for the health centres' outcome indicators. Furthermore, concerns about potential response bias were raised about the fact that facilitators were part of ASSK project team even though most were not directly involved in the committees' activities. However, the data and methodological triangulation, introduced to limit biases, reinforces our confidence in the validity of our findings.434.2 ConclusionThis paper aimed to address the considerable gap in the literature regarding patient engagement initiatives in primary healthcare services in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using results from a mixed-method case study, it explored the structure, processes, and outcomes of three advocacy user committees involving under-represented groups in healthcare services: adolescents and women. Furthermore, this paper discussed facilitating factors and obstacles to the implementation and activities of user committees in the DRC context that could be useful for future implementations.

"AbstractThe insurance financial management information system has accumulated a large amount of data as the insurance financial system has improved and the number of people investing in insurance has increased rapidly. The performance of the insurance agency significantly contributes to the industry's growth, which leads to economic prosperity. Different financial ratios were developed to investigate it, taking into consideration the insurance provider's stability, insolvency, profitability, and leverage. The profitability of organizations and insurers is used to evaluate the general effectiveness. In order to achieve this goal, this study examines the impact of insolvency, leverage, stability, scope, and impartiality of capital on the efficiency of Chinese life insurers. The study of financial statements examines a company's overall financial health throughout time. It is a method of identifying a company's financial assets and liabilities by integrating a statement of financial position and balance sheet features. It provides a systematic approach to assessing and evaluating the company's predicament. Using the experimental results, the scores of several insurance firms are compared, and their performance is described based on these results. The effective use of these data to assist decision-makers in developing more reasonable financial insurance investment policies have emerged as a significant challenge that must be addressed.

The effective use of these data to assist decision-makers in developing more reasonable financial insurance investment policies have emerged as a significant challenge that must be addressed. This study utilized the decision tree C 4.5 mining algorithm to analyze insurance financial system data, identify key factors influencing insurance finance, and assist decision-makers in optimizing policy parameters. Finally, the consequence of an increase is analyzed using a previously unseen method to assess the precision of the prediction result.1. IntroductionInsurance is a form of financial protection against a range of financial hardships. A contract among the involved individuals: the insurer and the protected recipient, defines this security. The insurance company is the organization that sells the policy, and the insured is the individual or organization that purchases the policy for the advantages it provides. In exchange for financial compensation, referred to as a high value, the insurance promises to absorb the responsibility of a protected entity against future eventualities [1]. In the event of an unexpected incident, the insurance company is required to pay the demand to the policyholder, i.e., the benefits are paid in full to the beneficiaries as specified in the company's policy. Insurance policies vary depending on the type of event covered. Auto insurance, health insurance, travel insurance, property insurance, and life insurance are just a few of"
"are paid in full to the beneficiaries as specified in the company's policy. Insurance policies vary depending on the type of event covered. Auto insurance, health insurance, travel insurance, property insurance, and life insurance are just a few of the many lines of business within the insurance organization. Therefore, the researcher is investigating various insurance and financial techniques in conjunction with various types of life security using artificial intelligence, big data mining, etc. [2]. Data analysis is the process of extracting potentially useful knowledge models or rules from large amounts of data. Data mining analysis employs association rules, classification, clustering, and other techniques. Data classification has a significant goal and task in data mining. As an important method of data mining classification, the decision tree data mining algorithm makes efforts on deducing the decision tree representation's evaluation rules from a set of unordered and regular cases. It has features like high data analysis efficiency, intuitiveness, and simplicity of use [3].The application of data mining in biomedicine mainly focuses on the research of molecular biology, especially genetic engineering. Its work in molecular biology can be divided into two types: one is to locate gene strings with certain functions from the DNA sequences of various organisms; functional proteins are similar to higher-order structural sequences.

"molecular biology can be divided into two types: one is to locate gene strings with certain functions from the DNA sequences of various organisms; functional proteins are similar to higher-order structural sequences. Database marketing and shopping basket analysis are two types of data mining applications used in marketing. The former's goal is to find new clients and offer them items using techniques including interactive searches, data segmentation, and model prediction [4]. The latter's role is to study market transaction data in order to perform an analysis of client purchasing behavior, which aids in determining shop shelf layout and encouraging sales. Data mining is mostly utilized in the banking industry for credit fraud modeling and trend analysis, as well as prediction, revenue analysis, risk assessment, and helping direct marketing efforts.According to the reviews, data mining algorithms are frequently used to detect fraudulent insurance and financial policies by examining connections or linkages between various claim records, and the study developed a strategy for identifying insurance claims [5]. Kareem et al. applied data mining classification rules to evaluate related features and help control information disparities in false claims, thereby reducing health insurance fraud.

The study provided an excellent explanation of why identifying health insurance fraud is one of the most challenging problems in the insurance industry. However, it did not give us the whole dataset descriptions utilized in their research [6]. Lin et al. proposed a framework in this work that could determine each characteristic in a given dataset. To analyze potential clients, these authors employed a sampling method in conjunction with a massive insurance firm data-mining training algorithm and proposed a collective random forest (RF) algorithm. They obtained insurance information about the company since China's life insurance establishment to use the specified technique. Furthermore, researchers evaluate the algorithm's performance using measurements and G-mean. The experimental result shows that, after being compared to the standard artificial methodology, the collective RF algorithm outperforms the support vector machine (SVM) and other classification models in efficiency and reliability within the unbalanced dataset [7]. This article presented several performance measures that may help determine the reliability of the techniques used in this study.

The findings of this study are critical in establishing elements for early warning systems and student achievement assessments that may be built for e-learning. Simultaneously, it will assist academics in selecting algorithms and preprocessing strategies for instructive data analysis. This study will assist us to identify numerous approaches in the orange miner tool that will let us do our experiments on the national insurance dataset [8].The process of mining theoretically beneficial material and information from large amounts of data is based on data mining. The decision tree classification method in data mining technology is used to discover hidden relationships and rules in data. It provides a theoretical foundation for policymakers to set and adjust parameters and also analyze and research several factors that limit fairness issues. To help decision makers make decisions, we should set the best parameters [9]. The research aims to see how machine learning and data mining algorithms might help insurance companies identify trends in different types of insurance claim evaluation categories.

Related WorkAccording to the literature review, insurance systems have undergone numerous significant changes in society, even during the global period, as proposed in this study. Rising stress in everyday life increases insurance demand. The authors of this study aim to determine how data mining benefits insurance companies, how its approaches improve insurance results, and how data mining aids decision-making utilizing insurance data. Secondary research, observations from many periodicals, and studies, among other sources were used in the theoretical study [10]. According to Devale et al. information discovery has been constructed in financial firms to improve decision-making by employing knowledge as a strategic factor. The goal of this study is to investigate the application of various data mining approaches for data discovery inside the insurance industry.

The decision maker can outline the insurance activities' development in proposed data mining strategies to enable the existing life protection division's particular capabilities [11]. Yeo et al. analyzed insurance prices using mathematical optimization tools and data mining methods. In a competitive insurance market, one of the most essential factors in attracting clients is pricing. They employed K-means clustering algorithms to categorize customers, as well as a neural network to assess each classification's value perceptions [12]. Bian et al. evaluate the driver's risk level using driver behavior relevant information and a bagging-based classification model to assist the insurance firm in identifying the most acceptable business payment mechanism for various insurance policies. Customers' needs can be identified by collecting information and data from product customers and analyzing it using data mining techniques. The information gathered could be put to good use to help the organization progress [13]. Kumar et al. investigate using data mining and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to provide product recommendations. To begin with, clients of the insurance business were separated into groups built on their age and revenue. The AHP was then used to control the comparative weights of a set of factors in order to choose the best products for every cluster [14].3."

Insurance and Financial Scheme Detection and Data Mining3.1. Bank SchemeA bank scheme can be defined as anyone deliberately implementing, or seeking to implement, a strategy or contrivance to deceive a financial company: to collect money, credits, funds, stocks, investments, or additional assets possessed by and further down the protection or control of a financial company by using false, fraudulent pretenses, promises, or representations [15]. A bank scheme can be defined as unauthorized card use, uncommon operation activity, or communications made with an inactive card. A significant misstatement, financial deception, or deception concerning the potential mortgage or property on which a benefactor or investor relies to account or acquire is defined as a mortgage scheme. If you want to engage in a card and credit card scheme, you should get a loan. Unauthorized card use, unusual transaction activity, and transactions on an inactive card are all case studies of it now [16]. According to the FBI, money laundering is the act of criminals concealing or concealing the benefits of their crimes, or converting those monies into services and products.

"to the FBI, money laundering is the act of criminals concealing or concealing the benefits of their crimes, or converting those monies into services and products. It gives criminals undue economic power by allowing them to infuse their illegal cash into the system, corroding financial organizations and the cash source. According to Gao and Ye, money laundering is the process by which criminals launder dirty disgusting money to conceal its illegal origins and make it appear legitimate and clean [17].3.2. Insurance SchemeCustomers, brokerages, insurance company workers, healthcare specialists, and others can perpetrate insurance products at many phases of the insurance process, including eligibility, claims, billing, rating, and application. Crops, automotive insurance schemes, and healthcare are the subjects of this study. According to the FBI, charging for medically unnecessary services, services not given, upcoding of services, upcoding of products, kickbacks, unbundling, excessive services, and duplicate claims are among the most prevalent kinds of the scheme. Crop insurance fraud occurs when policyholders fake or exaggerate crop losses due to natural disasters or income losses due to agricultural commodity price declines [18,19].

"[18,19]. Automobile insurance fraud encompasses staged accidents, needless repairs, and manufactured personal injuries. Figure1shows a framework of data mining applications.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4. The Principle of the 2C4.5 AlgorithmTo create decision tree classifiers, the C4.5 algorithm is employed. The data gain values of each descriptive feature are compared in this procedure, and the attribute with the greatest value is chosen for categorization. The C4.5 algorithm creates decision trees based on the concept of information gain, with each classification's decision being linked to the target classification. The best way to assess uncertainty is to use entropy [20,21].(1)In this article, the effective reduction of the information descendant is referred to as information gain. Using this method, it is possible to determine which types of variables are chosen for classification at what level. Assume that there have been two classes, P and N, and that record set S comprisesxP information andyN records. The following is the amount of data required to decide which category a record in record set S belongs to(2)Considering that variablesDare used as the decision tree's root, the record set S is separated into subclasses {s1,s2, ...,sk} with eachsi(i= 1,2, ...,k) containingxidata from class P andy1records from class N.

Then, there is the quantity of data required to categorize all of the subclasses:(3)If variableDis chosen as the classification node, the value of its data increments must be greater than the values of the other variables. The variableDdata increment is(4)A generic definition of the information gain function may be derived from this(5)4.1. Pruning of Decision TreesA pruning strategy for the decision tree is adopted when the fully grown decision tree is obtained. In this way, branch anomalies caused by noisy data and isolated nodes are eliminated. To address the problem of overadaptation of training data, decision trees are reduced. Statistically, approaches are typically used in the pruning process to remove the most unreliable branches and enhance the speed of identification and characterization, or the capacity to accurately classify data. The goal is to eliminate outliers and noise from the training set. The prepruning method and the postpruning approach are the two most common methods for pruning branches [22,23].4.1.1. Front Trimming MethodThis approach is accomplished by halting the tree's formation in advance, i.e., deciding. Once a branch is terminated and the current node becomes a leaf node, it is important to continue dividing or splitting the subset of training samples at that node. Statistical significance detection or information gain can be used to assess branch"
"Once a branch is terminated and the current node becomes a leaf node, it is important to continue dividing or splitting the subset of training samples at that node. Statistical significance detection or information gain can be used to assess branch development while building a decision tree. If the samples on a node are divided, the samples in the lower node will fall below a certain threshold. Then, we continued dissecting the sample set; selecting a suitable threshold is frequently challenging. A threshold that is too high will result in oversimplification of the decision tree, while a threshold that is too low will result in the failure to prune redundant branches.4.1.2. Postpruning MethodThis method is a popular decision tree-pruning strategy. The input of the postpruning algorithm is an unpruned treeT, and the output is a pruned decision tree T1, which is the tree obtained after pruning one or more subtrees in T. The cost-complexity-based pruning algorithm is an exposed pruning method in which the bottom unpruned node becomes a leaf. It is designated as the category with the most categories in the samples it contains. The anticipated error rate is calculated after each nonleaf node in the tree is pruned, as well as the predicted error rate after a node is not pruned depending on the weight of a separate branch and the error rate of the separate branch. If pruning increases the projected classification error rate, the trimming will be unrestricted, and the branches of"
"predicted error rate after a node is not pruned depending on the weight of a separate branch and the error rate of the separate branch. If pruning increases the projected classification error rate, the trimming will be unrestricted, and the branches of the consistent node will be maintained; then, the consistent node branch will be pruned and removed [24].An independent test data set is used to evaluate the results after generating a sequence of trimmed decision tree applicants. The classification precision of the clipped decision trees is evaluated, and the tree with the lowest expected classification error rate and decision tree is maintained. In addition to the increased classifying error rate, the decision tree's embedding length can be used for decision tree pruning.4.2. Decision Tree Rule ExtractionThe decision tree can then be used to directly extract the corresponding decision rules after pruning. Decision trees are intuitive and simple to understand because the classification rules are expressed in the form and each rule is a path from the root. The leaf node then represents the specific conclusion. The nodes and edges above the leaf node represent the condition value of the corresponding condition [25].

Processing of DataThe operator information of the data table item is required by the C4.5 algorithm. It uses a type definition file, which is an ASCII file with a suffix of names, to record the type of each attribute item or the range of potential values. According to the type description, the C4.5 algorithm will compute the gain of each feature item.The computer calculates the gain value of each descriptive feature in a round-robin manner, compares the gain values of each attribute, chooses the attribute with the highest gain value for classifications, and ultimately builds an ideal decision tree. The program flow of the mining algorithm is shown in Figure3. First, the initial variables of the program are set according to the initial input data: the window size and the value of the increment, and then different classification trees are generated in a continuous cycle. The pruned error rates are compared to find the best classifier.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint5.2.

Analysis of the ResultsIn marketing research, financial institutions may employ association rules. The data examined in this case are material on the protection that customers obtain. The insurance provider can create a classification model that specifies which insurance is acquired when a policy is purchased. The company goals to benefit from the association amid several policies sold for varied goals based on all these realities. The same company with customers having two insurance plans is far more likely to renew than those with only insurance. A customer with multiple policies is less likely to transfer than a customer with fewer policies. A company adds value and improves customer satisfaction by offering significant discounts and packaged products to customers, such as life insurance and investment plans, reducing the likelihood of the customer switching to a competitor.

"and pruning, analysis and evaluation, and rule generation. This article investigates the application of data mining techniques to insurance finance data statistics. Some factors affecting the insurance industry are initially obtained, and after experiments, the effect is relatively good, but there is no in-depth research on other influences in this experiment. Therefore, reinforce learning while gradually fixing its flaws in the future learning process. Possibly, comparing results with various categorization methods might be part of future research. Customer segmentation learning efficiency and performance might also be evaluated using computational complexity analysis. Other industries that might benefit from the strategy recommended in this study include retail, healthcare, food, and bookshops.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe datasets used to support the findings of this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.References1Wang Y.

"AbstractIn order to promote the orderly development of cities and realize social public interests, a design method of a land reserve-oriented multimedia information management system is proposed. It is of great practical significance to integrate and sort out the whole process of land reserve projects through spatial information platform, effectively manage land reserve, land supply, and planning information, improve the utilization rate of land resources, and provide information support and decision-making basis for land expropriation and land registration and certification. By combining scattered information resources, integrated into a unified information service platform, realize the unified update and maintenance of all kinds of data, increase the reusability of data, and avoid data synchronization between the two levels of urban land reserve departments and the resulting waste of resources. After three tests and modifications on 50 devices, successfully increased the operation success rate from 86% to 100%, and a complete and effective land reserve multimedia information management system has been successfully developed. In order to better do the handover and transition of the reserve work, it is necessary to integrate, update, and improve the historical and existing reserve projects and build a unified and standardized land reserve geographic information database, so as to effectively promote the sharing and application of information resources.1.

"update, and improve the historical and existing reserve projects and build a unified and standardized land reserve geographic information database, so as to effectively promote the sharing and application of information resources.1. IntroductionThe informatization and paperless construction of land resource management is not only one of the key construction contents of \"digital city\" but also one of the key contents of e-government construction [1]. The transformation of government functions and the increasing maturity of computer technology, there is an urgent need for land resource management to develop in the direction of informatization, scientification, standardization, and public service. Looking at the current situation of informatization construction in various places, it is still not optimistic [2]. Many places still use the traditional work model and use paper media to record and store relevant data, the process is cumbersome, registration is difficult, access is inconvenient, digitalization is low, management is chaotic, and this leads to low work efficiency [3]. Therefore, in order to improve the level of land management informatization, in the construction of the geospatial framework of the digital city with the land administration department as the lead unit, both will build a land resource management information system, listed as one of the typical demonstration application system construction.

"the land administration department as the lead unit, both will build a land resource management information system, listed as one of the typical demonstration application system construction. On the basis of careful analysis of the above background, the process of land resources business and daily management was sorted out, researched how to structure and construct the land resource management system [4]. The theory and method of basic spatial data construction are systematically studied, and the framework of the land resource management information system is established; also, use C# as the development language, with Oracle11g as the data support platform, and based on the ArcGIS platform, the development of the land resource management information system has been realized, so as to meet the needs of the daily work process of various departments [5]. Taking into account the goals and functional requirements of the system construction, and the current international and domestic technological trends in the construction of \"digital cities,\" combining the actual situation and taking into account the actual needs of the system, it is in line with the technology of the future informatization framework, and Figure1shows the overall technical framework of the system.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall technical framework of the system.GIS technology is a comprehensive crossdiscipline, it mainly involves many subjects such as graphics, vision, and database, and"
"overall technical framework of the system.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall technical framework of the system.GIS technology is a comprehensive crossdiscipline, it mainly involves many subjects such as graphics, vision, and database, and because GIS has unstructured data and powerful spatial analysis functions, it is different from general information systems: Geographic Information System (referred to as GIS) and Computer Aided Cartography (referred to as CAD); there is a big difference between the three database management systems (DBMS) [6]. The advantage of computer-aided drawing is that it has a relatively strong ability in graphics processing, and the disadvantage is that it cannot handle complex spatial relationships; moreover, the processing of massive spatial data is also weak. Database management system generally used to store and manage structured data; however, there are relatively large defects in the query, management, analysis, and display functions of graphics. The data involved in the GIS system is mainly composed of two parts: spatial data and attribute data; through the combination of the two, spatial entities can be expressed. The types of spatial data mainly include point features, line features, and area features, and attribute data is mainly a collection of auxiliary information used to express spatial entities [7].2.

"line features, and area features, and attribute data is mainly a collection of auxiliary information used to express spatial entities [7].2. Literature ReviewIn response to this research question, Mwangi and others, under the guidance of the city's master plan, land use plan, and land reserve plan, use GIS technology to build a dynamic, integrated, and all-element land reserve dynamic management model that covers the entire region, strengthen the connection and sharing of land reserve information and planning land management information, and improve the overall process control ability of reserve work plan preparation, operation procedures, work standards, and information management [8]. Zhou and others stated that the dynamic management and monitoring of land reserves are a long-term task, through the establishment of a land reserve project data management mechanism, which systematically understands the status of land reserves in various regions, so as to fully carry out land reserve supervision work [9]. Norgrove and others sorted out the reserve process of the land reserve project, achieve full coverage of land reserve projects, comprehensively reflecting the implementation information of project approval, business implementation, capital management, etc., and realize the real-time update of the reserve project data [10].

Vries. et al. proposed, on the basis of sorting out and categorizing the business links of land reserve, pay attention to business management standard design and process optimization and unify the business standards of various reserve agencies and standardize the implementation of land reserve projects [11]. Buchanan and others built a spatial geographic database of land reserves through research, according to the internal logic of different dimensions and data such as \"time, region, topic, and level,\" and reintegrate the data resources that have been mastered [12]. Nguyen. et al. said to build a land bank database that can be flexibly configured and managed and dynamically updated and backed up, through data extraction, parallel database processing, and other technologies, make decentralized data a logically centralized land bank data system, realize the unified management, calling, analysis and operation, and maintenance of data, and further enhance the support and guarantee capacity of land reserve work [13]. Ramesh et al. conducted completeness checks on the accumulated project data, land use status data, planning data, and remote sensing image data accumulated over the years and generate a detailed list of existing data [14].

"sensing image data accumulated over the years and generate a detailed list of existing data [14]. Based on this, Epstein et al. organize data according to unified requirements, including standardized processing, data item supplementation, data format conversion, coordinate conversion, topology reconstruction, data storage, construction of data index, establishment of data dictionary, and maintenance of metadata [15]. Hameed et al. stated that land reserve is a large-scale land acquisition, consolidation, and supply plan and has a substantial impact on the city's development patterns and land prices, and it is the main means to regulate and regulate the land market, promote the orderly development of cities, and realize social public interests [16]. Pramadi and others, through the integration of spatial information platforms, and sorted out the whole process of land reserve project, effectively managed land reserve and land supply and planning information, improve the utilization rate of land resources, issue certificates for land acquisition and land registration, and provide information support and decision-making basis, and it has strong practical significance [17].

"technology and social economy, as well as the in-depth understanding of the informatization of e-government management by the land department, the demand for informatization is increasing day by day. Many precious experiences have provided the basis for the construction of the land and resource management information system.3. Methods3.1. Design of the Land Reserve Multimedia Information Management SystemThe overall goal of the system is summarized in the following two points: (1) relying on the geographic information public service platform, integrating cadastral, land use status, planning, minerals, geological disasters, and other multisource information and establish a thematic database of land resources, in order to be able to meet the requirements of \"a picture\" management; (2) combining land office business, build a system that combines GIS and business processes, realize the operation of land office business that can combine graphics and text, and improve the efficiency of land management [18]. The construction of a land resource management information platform is very difficult, involves more disciplines, and requires higher professional standards, mainly related to network communication, geographic information system technology, spatial database technology, spatial data update and information release, etc., in order to achieve the system design goals, in the whole process of system construction, and we always follow the relevant specifications of software"
"system technology, spatial database technology, spatial data update and information release, etc., in order to achieve the system design goals, in the whole process of system construction, and we always follow the relevant specifications of software engineering, do a good job in user needs, overall design, and detailed design, and gradually implement, tested, and perfected, in the construction of the system, \"advanced and efficient\" that should also be used as the basic criteria to establish a \"massive, open, safe, convenient and friendly\" system architecture. The territorial spatial database organizes spatial data according to the Geodatabase data model of ArcSDE [19]. The Geodatabase data model recognizes, organizes, manages, and applies spatial data according to its own spatial logical relationship, and it greatly facilitates the use of spatial data by users and maximizes the function of spatial data. This system involves a lot of data content, and the amount of data is large, from a classification point of view, including three database contents: land space database, land registration attribute database, and land special attribute database, such as Table1: system database.Table  1.System database.Serial numberNameLogoMain content1Land spatial databaseTDUSERCadastre, land use status, land use planning, mineral resources, and other data2Land registration property databaseTDDJSJKLand registration receipt, application, investigation, approval, and other business process"

The land registration database stores the forms filled in when the country's land registry is issued, mainly for the office of the Cadastral Division of the Land and Resources Bureau. The national land special database stores the attribute tables of other special businesses; at present, the main data content is index data and document information related to land use planning, it is mainly for the Planning Division of the Municipal Land and Resources Bureau, and other special data can be added later as needed [20].The land and resource management system is based on system construction goals and tasks, according to the business jurisdiction and its geographic information requirements, and divides the entire information system into the following 7 subsystems: urban and rural integrated cadastral"
"system is based on system construction goals and tasks, according to the business jurisdiction and its geographic information requirements, and divides the entire information system into the following 7 subsystems: urban and rural integrated cadastral management, land use planning management, land reserve management, cadastral data processing, subsystems such as mineral resource management, geological disaster management, and system maintenance management. In this system, the subsystem and the subsystem are relatively independent, but at the same time, it also cooperates with each other and can achieve information sharing [21]. The specific division structure is shown in Figure2: system division structure diagram.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem partition structure diagram.In order to achieve nonoverlapping functions between various system applications, realize the reuse of components, and the system adopts modular software design and component design ideas, reduces development workload and facilitates system maintenance, thereby reducing development costs, and improves software productivity. The software reuse of functional modular design is based on the reuse of binary code, and all operating platforms that support COM and other components can be shared. In the development process of the system, the functions of the system are mainly displayed in the form of UI [22].

"support COM and other components can be shared. In the development process of the system, the functions of the system are mainly displayed in the form of UI [22]. Therefore, UI acts as a bridge between humans and computers and plays a vital role, and the effect of the design greatly affects the user's evaluation. If the developed system interface can be friendly and easy to operate, it is a good thing for users. If you want to make the designed system interface meet the user's requirements, on the one hand, it is necessary to make as perfect as possible the functions realized by the system; on the other hand, you have to design the interface, as far as possible in line with the user's operating habits [23].Step 1.According to the conditions of the principal component mathematical model,FiandFjare uncorrelated with each otheri≠ 1,i,j= 1, 2, ⋯,p, and the principal components are required to be uncorrelated with each other. For this reason, the covariance matrix between the principal components should be a diagonal matrix. That is, for principal component (1),(1)Its covariance matrix should be (2)(2)Step 2.Let the covariance matrix of the original data beV. If the original data is normalized, the covariance matrix is equal to the correlation matrix, that is, (3):(3)The third step is based on the conditions of the principal component mathematical model and the properties of the orthogonal matrix. If the conditions can be met, the best requirement is to be an orthogonal matrix,"
"the correlation matrix, that is, (3):(3)The third step is based on the conditions of the principal component mathematical model and the properties of the orthogonal matrix. If the conditions can be met, the best requirement is to be an orthogonal matrix, that is, to satisfy (4)(4)Then, substitute the covariance of the original data into the covariance matrix formula of the principal components to get (5) and (6):(5)(6)In order to obtain the solution of the homogeneous equation, the determinant of the coefficient matrix is required to be 0, as shown in the following equations (7) and (8):(7)(8)Similar equations can be obtained from the second column, third column, etc.; so,λiis equation (9):(9)The variance relative toFiis(10)3.2. Realization of the Land Reserve Multimedia Information Management SystemIn the system, the design of the communication contract interface is mainly through three interfaces: IApplication (host program interface), IPlugin (plug-in object interface), and IPluginService (plug-in framework interface). The design of system functions mainly adopts the idea of component development mode, and the basic idea of component-based development components is as follows: divide software applications that are large and complex, or have the same functional modules, into a series of unit components that can be implemented first and are easy to develop, understand, and adjust. Take GIS secondary development platform ArcEngine development components as an example, it"
"and complex, or have the same functional modules, into a series of unit components that can be implemented first and are easy to develop, understand, and adjust. Take GIS secondary development platform ArcEngine development components as an example, it provides map display control AxMapControl, cartographic control AxPageLayoutControl, layer control AxTOCControl and toolbar control AxToolbarContrl, and other general controls, it is the use of component-based development technology, which makes in the process of GIS system development, by directly dragging and dropping these controls onto the form, and a simple GIS system can be implemented [24]. Based on the author that puts in the land resource management information system, common functions of each subsystem (such as map browsing, map query, map mapping, and spatial analysis) are extracted and packaged together in the form of plug-ins, which is equivalent to a higher-level component; then, when each subsystem needs these functional modules, as long as the corresponding plug-in and the generated DLL are placed in the specified folder, the goal can be achieved, so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of development work, and improve development efficiency [25]. The system is collected in the style of office2010, closer to the operating habits of the staff, the system is mainly composed of 7 parts, and they are the menu bar, layer manager, map display, thumbnails, status bar, map right click, layer right click, etc. [26].

The following are the specific functions of these 7 components:(1)The menu bar is mainly used to store the functions of each subsystem, such as map tool bar, map query tool, result output, thematic map, and land registration(2)The layer manager is used to manage land-related spatial data(3)The map display is mainly used to display land-related data, spatial positioning, spatial analysis result data, etc.(4)The function of the thumbnail is similar to looking down from the air, browsing the map displayed in the map display, and the position in the entire map(5)The status bar is used to display the current user's operations in real time and to display the coordinates of the current spatial position of the mouse(6)The right button of the map provides the operation function of the map, such as panoramic view, previous view, next view, map zoom function, select elements, clear elements, create polygon elements, and boundary point result table(7)The right button of the layer provides the operation function of the layer, such as symbolizing, deleting layers, zooming to layers, viewing attribute tables, optional and nonselectable layers, set labels, display labels, and layer attributes4.

And on this basis, they introduced the land resource management information system, the key technologies adopted, and the composition, functions, and implementation methods of the system, adopt plug-in type, ArcGIS Engine, ArcSDE, Oracle11g, and C/S network structure method, and developed a land resource management information system, so as to meet the daily work flow needs of various departments of land resources. Due to actual needs, this system is based on the C/S structure, without the research and development of the WebGIS function module. In the future, the WebGIS module can be strengthened, or the C/S and B/S structures can be combined.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that she/he has no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the Subject of Educational Scientific Research Planning of Anhui Vocational and Adult Education Society \"AGZ18003.\"Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Wei Y.,Wang X.,Wang R., andGui Y.,Design and implementation of agricultural production management"
