"it is essential to evaluate the information management system proposed in this paper's relevant performance. In order to make the data more real and objective, this paper cites other information management systems on the Internet to compare and analyze with the efficient information management system studied in this paper. Finally, 5 users and 5 administrators are asked to use these systems according to their own information, and a questionnaire survey is conducted on their satisfaction after use. For the convenience of research, this paper names the different systems as X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5, of which system 5 is the system studied in this paper, and different users and administrators are also named according to their serial numbers. The data are shown in Table1.1.The specific data of the experimenter.PersonnelAgeWeight (kg)Height (cm)Y11855168Y22161171Y32645159Y43452163Y51959178G12553162G22157167G32954165G43255169G523581725. Management System Development Strategy Design Results5.1. Comparison of Different Systems in terms of ManagementThe management system is being researched and developed to implement a more consistent management of the school's sports data. To conduct an in-depth analysis of the management effectiveness of the sports information management system under data mining, it is required to compare the management of various systems in detail in order to determine how effective each system's management is.

"of the sports information management system under data mining, it is required to compare the management of various systems in detail in order to determine how effective each system's management is. For this reason, a comparison and analysis of the management aspects of different systems are carried out, and the specific data are shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure6, the comparison of management aspects of different systems is mainly carried out from six aspects, such as management efficiency, stability, response time, processing speed, throughput, and management effect. In terms of management efficiency, the management efficiency of different systems was increasing from low to high. The efficiency of X1 was the lowest, only about 40%, while the management effect of X5 was the highest, up to about 90%. In terms of stability, the stability of X1 and X2 were roughly the same, and the stability was the lowest among the five systems, indicating that the stability of these two systems was far less than that of other systems. In terms of response time, the proportion of X3, X4, and X5 was the highest, much higher than several other management systems. In terms of processing speed, the proportion of X2 was the lowest among all systems, only about 57%, indicating that it took a long time to use this system. In terms of throughput, the ratios of X4 and X5 were both above 90%, which was significantly higher than that of other systems, indicating"
"of X2 was the lowest among all systems, only about 57%, indicating that it took a long time to use this system. In terms of throughput, the ratios of X4 and X5 were both above 90%, which was significantly higher than that of other systems, indicating that it was not easy to cause stuttering when using these two systems. In terms of management effect, the proportion of X5 was the highest among all systems, indicating that the effect of using this system was relatively good. On the whole, the efficient information management system based on data mining technology had the best performance in management and had great practical significance. Its development strategy should focus on the research of management efficiency.5.2. Comparison of Performance of Different SystemsDifferent systems have their own capabilities. In the detailed analysis of the information management system based on data mining, it is also necessary to study its own performance; otherwise it is very likely that the overall function has problems due to its own performance problems. In order to make the data more diverse, this paper compares and analyzes the performance of different systems, and the specific data is shown in Figure7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointWhen comparing the performance of different systems, it is carried out from six aspects: operability, flexibility, convenience, fault tolerance, confidentiality, and accuracy.

"comparing the performance of different systems, it is carried out from six aspects: operability, flexibility, convenience, fault tolerance, confidentiality, and accuracy. In terms of operability and flexibility, both X4 and X5 had the highest scores of all systems, both above 8. The scores of other systems in these two aspects were at least 1 point lower than those of the X4 and X5 systems, which mean that the operation failure was not easy to occur when the X4 and X5 systems were used. In terms of convenience, the scores of X1 and X3 were far less than those of other systems, indicating that the process was more complicated when using this system to manage information. In terms of fault tolerance, the score of X4 was about 1 point higher than that of X5, indicating that the fault tolerance of X5 needed to be improved. In terms of confidentiality, the score of X5 was significantly higher than that of other systems, indicating that when using the X5 system to manage information, it was difficult to leak management information. In terms of accuracy, the score of X3 was less than 5 points, which was the lowest among all systems, indicating that the information queried on the X3 system was prone to confusion. Although the score of X5 in fault tolerance was a little lower than that of X4, the performance of the information management system based on data mining was the best overall, and it was difficult to cause problems that greatly affect information management and query during"
"of X5 in fault tolerance was a little lower than that of X4, the performance of the information management system based on data mining was the best overall, and it was difficult to cause problems that greatly affect information management and query during use. The development strategy should focus on improving its fault tolerance performance.5.3. Comparison of Different Systems in Terms of CostEach system incurs a certain cost from construction to operation and use, but the cost is not the same. For this reason, this paper compares the cost of different systems, and the specific data is shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointWhen comparing the cost of different systems, the research is carried out from five aspects: development cost, operation cost, maintenance cost, usage cost, and management cost. In terms of development cost, X4 had the highest score among all systems, followed by X1 and X2, which had relatively high development costs, indicating that when researching the development of these three systems, the cost was relatively high. In terms of operating cost, the score of X5 was far lower than the other four management information systems, which showed that this system could save a lot of cost when running. In terms of maintenance cost, the scores of X1 and X4 were both above 7 points, which was much higher than the other three systems, indicating that the cost of maintaining these two systems was relatively high. In terms of cost of use, the score of X4 was"
"In terms of maintenance cost, the scores of X1 and X4 were both above 7 points, which was much higher than the other three systems, indicating that the cost of maintaining these two systems was relatively high. In terms of cost of use, the score of X4 was significantly higher than that of other systems by about 2 points, indicating that a large amount of economic consumption was prone to occur when using this system. In terms of management cost, the score of X5 was less than 5 points, indicating that this system could spend less cost in managing information. On the whole, the cost consumption of the information management system based on data mining technology is relatively low in all aspects, which can save a lot of money. Therefore, its development strategy should reduce the attention of this aspect.5.4. Comparison of Different Systems in Terms of QueryTo develop a data mining sports information management system, it is needed to conduct research on query, but it is relatively simple to conduct strategy research only from the query function of the system itself, and no effective data can be obtained. The comparison of different systems in terms of query is analyzed, and the specific data is shown in Figure9.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure9, when comparing the query aspects of different systems, it is mainly compared from three aspects: query speed, query time, and query effect.

"viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure9, when comparing the query aspects of different systems, it is mainly compared from three aspects: query speed, query time, and query effect. In terms of query speed, the scores of X2 and X3 were the same, both below 6 points. This showed that the query speed was too slow when using these two systems to query information, which easily affected the user's experience. In terms of query time, the scores of X3 and X5 were both above 8 points, which was much higher than that of other systems, indicating that when using these two management information systems, relevant information can be queried within a period of time. In terms of query effect, the scores of X1 and X3 were relatively low among all systems, indicating that the effect of using these two systems to query information was relatively poor, and it was easy to find the problem that information cannot be queried. On the whole, the information management system based on data mining technology has better performance in query, so its development strategy should be put in a little research center.5.5. Satisfaction of Different Users with Different SystemsThe main purpose of researching the development strategy of information management system under data mining is to make users and administrators easy to use and improve their satisfaction. The comparison and analysis were carried out, and the specific data are shown in Figure10.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from"

The comparison and analysis were carried out, and the specific data are shown in Figure10.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure10, user Y1 had the highest satisfaction with X5, which had almost reached 10 points, indicating that Y1 thought that X5 had the best use effect. User Y2 had the highest satisfaction with X4 and X5, both of which were above 8 points. User Y3's satisfaction with X1 and X3 was only about 6 points, which was the lowest score among all systems. User Y4's satisfaction with X4 was significantly higher than other management systems, indicating that Y4 thought X4 was more in line with his expectations. User Y5's satisfaction with X3 was the lowest among all systems, only about 4 points. User G1's satisfaction with X4 and X5 was the lowest among all systems, indicating that G1 thought that X4 and X5 had better management effects. User G2's satisfaction with X2 and X3 was significantly lower than other systems. Users G3, G4, and G5 had the highest satisfaction with X1, X4, and X5 among all systems, indicating that these three users thought that the management effect of X1, X4, and X5 was better. On the whole, except for the user Y4, other users were generally more satisfied with the X5, but the difference in satisfaction with the X4 was not widened. To this end, its development strategy should focus on the user's satisfaction.6."

To this end, its development strategy should focus on the user's satisfaction.6. ConclusionAs sports receive more and more attention from the public, more and more schools are beginning to treat sports as a professional course. However, this also means that information management system development strategies in various schools are frequently placed on the agenda. The deep level relationships between pertinent information are not taken into account in the present sports information management system development techniques, making it impossible for the management system to function as intended and completely satisfy user expectations. To provide a foundation for decision-making in physical education teaching, a thorough study of the systematic development plan has been conducted. This study compares several systems in terms of administration, performance, cost, and query, as well as the happiness of various users with various systems. It also evaluates data mining technologies and analyzes various systems collectively. The aim is to increase customer satisfaction and collect precise data on development plan.

"C/S application or within the components is adopted. The performance of the software and hardware of the system is tested experimentally, and the results show that the electricity marketing information system has good performance.1. IntroductionSince the reform and opening up, especially after the implementation of fund-raising and multiple-run electricity, my country's electric electricity industry has undergone tremendous changes. The installed capacity has greatly increased, and the electricity shortage that has plagued economic development and daily life has been basically alleviated. However, while achieving gratifying achievements, we have to face a new practical problem. When electricity production can meet the needs of society, the development of the electricity industry has changed from an increase in quantity to an improvement in quality, and the development strategy has changed from a \"seller's market\" to a \"buyer's market\" [1]. How to deliver high-quality electric energy to thousands of households and make electric electricity customers voluntarily and preferentially choose to use electric energy has become an important issue in front of us. With the deepening of the electricity market reform and the establishment and development of the commercial operation of the electricity grid, the electricity industry, like other industries, begins to face the challenges of the market, and all its production and operation activities will revolve around the main line of"
"and development of the commercial operation of the electricity grid, the electricity industry, like other industries, begins to face the challenges of the market, and all its production and operation activities will revolve around the main line of economic benefits. The establishment of the system of \"separation of factory and network and bidding for the Internet\" has promoted the pace of electricity grid operation enterprises to enter the market. Electricity demand will remain a buyer's market for a long time to come. How to open up the electricity market and increase the share of electricity consumption in the terminal energy is the primary consideration of the electricity sector [2]. To open up the electricity market and serve customers in an all-round way is inseparable from modern management tools and fast and efficient service methods. In today's knowledge-based economy and information age, if we do not rely on advanced computer technology and provide customers with high-quality services, our enterprises will eventually lose the market [3]. Electricity will be disadvantaged in the competition with other alternative energy sources. When the electricity goes to market, marketing work is the key. Therefore, the quality of electric electricity marketing is directly related to the economic benefits of electric electricity enterprises. It is also the embodiment of the image of electric electricity enterprises, and the modern management and service of electric electricity"
"of electric electricity marketing is directly related to the economic benefits of electric electricity enterprises. It is also the embodiment of the image of electric electricity enterprises, and the modern management and service of electric electricity marketing have become very urgent [4]. The State Grid Corporation of China has successively issued development plans for marketing modernization such as how to implement these development plans into the process of marketing services, adhere to the combination of advanced nature and practicality, adhere to the combination of service and efficiency, and insist on the combination of management innovation and technological innovation. Being consistent with the overall development goal of \"world-class electricity supply enterprise,\" it promotes the innovation of marketing management and service concepts with technological innovation and promotes the standardization of marketing business processes. In the process of marketing modernization, we will continuously optimize the organizational structure and business processes, improve the quality of personnel, and gradually establish a marketing mechanism and system that adapts to market changes and quickly reflects customer needs [5].

"With the full implementation of group operation, intensive operation, and refined management as the main line, the top-down marketing management, customer service automation, informatization of the State Grid Corporation of China headquarters, various network and provincial companies, and grassroots electricity supply companies will be realized. The unified management of electricity purchase and sales are realized and the overall coordination, strategic decision-making, operation management, leadership ability, control ability, and decision-making level of the company headquarters are improved to deal with complex situations. Effectively control and reduce the cost of electricity purchase, enhance profitability, increase market share, and meet the needs of sustainable development of the company [6]. The 12 subordinate electric electricity bureaus have promoted and implemented a unified version of the marketing management system. And, the data warehouse technology is used to collect the summary and statistical data of the province's marketing in the provincial company headquarters, which can meet the needs of marketing professional leaders' query and management. Since the system has been running for more than 5 years, it has accumulated rich experience in marketing management specifications, information system specifications, and technical specifications.

"accumulated rich experience in marketing management specifications, information system specifications, and technical specifications. At present, a wide-area information network with two ring networks in the east and the west has been built. At the same time, the company's wide area network has a 4 M backup channel and is equipped with two 100 M export channels to connect to the Internet. A high-quality marketing informatization foundation and good wide-area network conditions have prepared for the realization of marketing group operation, intensive operation, refined management, and the construction of a centralized marketing technical support system [7]. Electric consumer goods and their supporting service products have a high one-to-one awareness of producers and consumers. Electric energy, which is based on the four necessities of human beings, is a consumer necessity that cannot be easily stripped. Facing the needs of customers, the service personnel of the enterprise includes not only the medium and low voltage operation and maintenance workers who read meters to the home but also the counter service personnel who handle various businesses such as expansion and installation of the electricity industry in the customer service center.

"center. There are also production technicians, electricity failure approval personnel, on-site repair monitoring personnel, and so on as technical support during the troubleshooting period. Only the full cooperation of various personnel can complete the full range of services for electricity customers, so information communication and sharing between them is an important part that restricts the improvement of service efficiency [5]. There are also electricity price reviews and changes for electricity customers with different electricity prices, real-time recording of customer electricity consumption information, and quarterly statistics of customer electricity consumption information to make statistical reports. Anticipate the need for electricity growth and plan the impact of grid load development standards to reduce the impact of load restrictions on customers' continuous electricity consumption. The combination of macro- and microelectricity grid shunting, load reversal and other intelligent deployment, electricity leakage monitoring, electricity stealing behavior monitoring and blocking, clearing the user's electricity consumption level, and reminding self-adjustment and a series of work are not one-time services [8].

"In the traditional electricity marketing system, these problems are chronic diseases, which require enterprises to invest a lot of resources to complete them, which increases the operating costs and resource consumption of enterprises. To establish a new generation of electricity marketing management information systems, intelligent screening of useful information is used to share all information. The content including the customer's average electricity consumption, electricity consumption category, and the operation status of the supporting electricity supply network is provided to the service representative who connects with the customer in real time. Improving the timeliness of information sharing can also enhance the sense of intimacy with customers and the responsiveness to deal with electricity emergencies [9]. Simply put, the electricity client uploads consumption data, the electricity supply level data are uploaded to the line end, and the automatic control system calculates and reports the analysis data to the electricity department, giving the line end and the client real-time feedback data requirements. In such interactive information flow transmission, consumption, production, and market demand communicate in real time, and information packets move bidirectionally between networks.

Related WorkElectricity marketing management information system is a typical application of management information system in electricity system operation and management. It is a management system integrating modern computer technology and communication technology. It mainly uses modern computer technology and communication technology to carry out process management of electricity marketing business and manages it in various forms such as text, graphics, data, and sound. Work efficiency and management level are improved. At the same time, it provides auxiliary decision-making to enterprises to obtain the best benefits [10]. The development of management information automation began in the 1950s and generally went through four stages. The first stage, the single-item data processing stage, is the primary stage in which computers are used for management. At this time, the computer is still a stand-alone system, and its application is mainly in the hands of computer personnel, and only a few functional managers use it.

The second stage, the comprehensive data processing stage, is the development stage of computer application in management. At this time, computer technology has begun to combine with communication technology to form a central network. A large computer connects multiple remote terminals through communication lines to serve multiple users [11,12]. The third stage, the management system stage, is the advanced stage of computer application in management. At this stage, computer and communication technology are closely integrated, multiple computers are connected into a network, and data transmission and file transfer are carried out between computers. Guided by modern mathematical methods such as operations research and systems engineering theory, software development is carried out, and a public database, model library, and method library are established. It constitutes a unified large system, which provides complete information and the best decision-making scheme to management departments at all levels. This system is still only a \"human-machine\" system, which is only an auxiliary management, rather than completely replacing human management. The fourth stage is the automatic management stage.

"replacing human management. The fourth stage is the automatic management stage. In terms of production management, the production automatic control system is connected with the management information system, and the production data are sent to the management information system in real time. The latter is the background machine of the former, and the former works under the guidance of the latter, forming an automated production management system. This can greatly improve the level of production and operation and try to be scientific and rational [13,14]. In the past ten years, the rapid development of computer technology and network technology has promoted the research and wide application of management information system. With the popularization and deepening of computer applications and the maturity of network technology, management information systems have developed from a single application to a comprehensive application, from simple processing to complex processing. The information processing mode has developed from centralized and decentralized to distributed, and application tasks are being transferred from mainframe systems to distributed networks supported by client/server (C/S) and browser/server (B/S) [15]. The electric electricity industry is an industry with a high level of modern technology, and the production of electric electricity is highly concentrated and unified.

"electricity industry is an industry with a high level of modern technology, and the production of electric electricity is highly concentrated and unified. The generation, supply, and consumption of electricity are carried out at the same time, and the production, supply, and sales are closely linked and are managed by the electricity company in a unified manner. The management organization and management methods of electric electricity enterprises are relatively strict, and the application of automation technology and the computer has a certain foundation. It can be said that the production and operation management conditions of the electric electricity industry have favorable conditions for the realization of management information automation. However, the current information management methods and means in the electricity system, especially the management means of electricity marketing, are not suitable for the needs of the electricity industry and the development of information technology. With the continuous development of computer technology and information processing technology, the function and scale of electricity marketing management information system are also developing rapidly [16,17].

"management information system is a huge system of engineering with high technical content and wide coverage. The method of system integration can greatly shorten the development cycle of the management information system. The integration strategy is divided into two levels. The first level is the integration of different modules within a single subsystem. With the improvement of the application level, the single-machine and single-item management software of each unit can no longer meet the needs. Only by integrating and organically combining them into a complete subsystem can it be called a \"system\" and provide effective management software for enterprises. Due to the great difference in the application level and the selected database of each unit, it is difficult to integrate the scattered systems uniformly. A province-based electricity marketing management information system construction policy is established, which can truly realize the province's monitoring, information processing, and shared query of electricity marketing business. It can make various information processing links connect with each other and make use of each other, which greatly improves the level of information processing automation [18]. The second level is the integration of various subsystems. Although many management information systems that have been developed at present have been gradually improved in the course of use, the use efficiency and benefits have been improved. The integration"
"second level is the integration of various subsystems. Although many management information systems that have been developed at present have been gradually improved in the course of use, the use efficiency and benefits have been improved. The integration technology of electricity marketing management information system includes the integration of computer hardware platform, network system, system software, tool software, application software, and middleware, as well as the corresponding consultation, service, and technical support around these systems. The development of network technology provides technical support and guarantee for the hardware integration of management information systems. The hardware integration can adopt C/S and B/S system structure, and the main advantage of this structure is that clients can share various resources and devices in the network. It is convenient to realize the interconnection, interoperability, and integration of multiple computer systems and improve the reliability and practicability of the entire system [19]. Software integration includes system software integration, application integration, and data integration. Generally, application software can be divided into three parts: the first part is interface presentation processing, which is the application code that interacts with devices such as user terminals or workstations, completes screen formatting, screen information reading and writing, window management, keyboard and mouse"
"first part is interface presentation processing, which is the application code that interacts with devices such as user terminals or workstations, completes screen formatting, screen information reading and writing, window management, keyboard and mouse management, and other tasks. The second part is transaction processing; the application code that uses the input data to complete the task. The third part is data and database management. Ensuring system reliability, high performance, high flexibility, and low cost is the key to management information systems [20]. Through application integration, the management information system can be coordinated in structure, function, and I/O format; it is not intended to overthrow the original or developing application. Instead, it acts as a \"red line\" that runs through the entire system, so that the original application program can directly play its original or greater role in the new system. Data integration is the core of marketing management information system integration. The purpose of data integration is to maintain the original local data consistently in the new system and improve its accuracy [21]. More importantly, in the new integrated system, these local data will become more comprehensive and complete information that users are more interested in. Then, users are provided with statistical analysis and decision support information, so that the information has greater practical value for users in the management information"
"more comprehensive and complete information that users are more interested in. Then, users are provided with statistical analysis and decision support information, so that the information has greater practical value for users in the management information system. The system integration method provides an effective way to develop the electricity marketing management information system. It makes the marketing management information system get rid of the limitations of scale, technology, and scope of adaptation and realizes both distributed processing and unified control and management. From the perspective of the openness of the system, it can enable enterprises to quickly absorb and utilize advanced international technologies, and at the same time make full use of the original various information and data resources. This not only ensures the advanced nature and practicability of the system but also utilizes the existing investment, which greatly shortens the system development, promotion, and application cycle [22].3.

Implement system disaster recovery from different levels, including hardware platform level, data level, and application system level disaster recovery.(8)Data separation. Separate operational data, analytical data, and decision-making data and ensure automatic archiving and online query of historical data.3.1.2. Overall Scheme DesignThe electricity marketing technical support system is constructed in a fully centralized way, with functions covering marketing management, 95598 customer service, customer payment, and electric energy collection and supervision modules. As well as the supervision and analysis functions to meet the daily business management requirements of marketing, the provincial company has unified the construction of a marketing data center and a marketing disaster recovery center. The marketing data center satisfies all the functions of daily marketing real-time business processing, and the marketing disaster recovery center of the same scale provides application-level disaster recovery support for large centralized systems. At the same time, the system resources of the disaster recovery center are fully utilized, and real-time services such as statistical reports, marketing supervision, and historical"
"application-level disaster recovery support for large centralized systems. At the same time, the system resources of the disaster recovery center are fully utilized, and real-time services such as statistical reports, marketing supervision, and historical queries that consume system resources are deployed based on the disaster recovery database of the marketing business. In this way, a marketing data warehouse is formed, various OLAP applications are deployed, and marketing analysis functions are realized. The application deployment of the disaster recovery center not only ensures the performance of real-time business processing in the marketing data center but also makes full use of the resources of the disaster recovery center. The basic data resources of marketing distributed in various regions and cities, and the basic data resources provided by other businesses of provincial companies are all collected through the data exchange platform, and the interaction between the marketing system and other businesses is also carried out through a unified data exchange platform. The marketing data warehouse also obtains some analysis source data from other external applications through ETL.

The"
"technology support system is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe logical diagram of the electricity company's marketing technology system.The system is planned and constructed according to the service-oriented architecture. The basic model includes four layers: access layer, application layer, service layer, and resource layer. The division of the basic model to four levels basically reflects the realization logic framework of the integrated business platform of electricity marketing. The logical layers are connected through corresponding protocols, adapters, data definition standards, and interfaces.Resource layer: share the public information integration facilities of the entire enterprise and deploy the marketing data center facilities at the same time. All resources use a unified system-level monitoring and management software to achieve unified management of enterprise information resources.Service layer: J2EE services and data warehouse services are provided by general commercial middleware, providing general service component objects such as application permission control, data exchange, workflow, etc., supporting the electricity marketing business application layer.Application layer: the business components of electricity marketing are all encapsulated in this layer.

"business components of electricity marketing are all encapsulated in this layer. The management of various general standardized marketing business components and related normative standards and constraints appears in the form of prefabricated application resources. These prefabricated business components can ensure the stability of the core business of the system and the stability of the system′s quality. When promoting applications at the implementation site, use various customizable platforms of the service layer according to the management responsibilities of the implementation site. Personalized deployment of prefabricated applications, composed of business logic used, and unified management by the system according to components and parts, the entire application layer can also be expanded and upgraded according to business development.Access layer: if the enterprise has a public enterprise portal platform, the marketing application fully supports single sign-on. To meet various requirements such as interface integration and public information release, before the establishment of the enterprise public portal platform, the system also has its own unified front-end interface display and access layer.3.2.

"System Design3.2.1. Software Architecture DescriptionThe basic composition of the electricity marketing technical support system is as follows:(1)Presentation layer. The presentation layer is the user interface part of the application and is the window for the interaction between the user and the system. It includes the user graphical interface and the logic components that communicate with the application layer. The main function is to check the data input by the user and display the data output by the system. The presentation layer takes the end user as the core to present and receive data according to the workflow set by the user, so as to realize the transition from the department-centered application environment to the process-centered application environment. If the presentation layer needs to be modified, it is only necessary to rewrite the display control and data verification procedures without affecting the other two layers. The content of the inspection is limited to the data format and value range and does not include the processing logic of the business itself.(2)Application layer. The application layer includes the functional processing logic of the application system, and the interface for sending messages between the presentation layer and the data layer. The application layer also manages the workflow between application layer logic components and multiple data layer logic components. All business processing programs in the application are in the application"
"the presentation layer and the data layer. The application layer also manages the workflow between application layer logic components and multiple data layer logic components. All business processing programs in the application are in the application layer; that is, except for the input/output functions in the presentation layer and the database in the data layer, all statistics, summarization, analysis, printing, and update functions are stored in the application layer.(3)Data layer. A DBMS must be able to perform updates and retrievals of large amounts of data quickly. The current mainstream is the relational database management system. Therefore, the database retrieval statements generally transmitted from the application layer to the data layer mostly use SQL statements.The distribution of the three-tier structure is very flexible, and there can be one or more servers in the application layer and the data layer. In this way, the database and application components in a large-scale information system can be distributed and run on different servers. These servers can be local or remote, making the system more reasonable, more flexible, and more scalable. In the three-tier structure, the presentation part, the application logic part, and the data part each occupy one layer. The presentation layer manages the interaction with the user and completes the request made by the client by invoking the middle layer. The application logic layer runs business logic and accesses"
"logic part, and the data part each occupy one layer. The presentation layer manages the interaction with the user and completes the request made by the client by invoking the middle layer. The application logic layer runs business logic and accesses databases and other resources. A client can call multiple server-based parts to fulfill a request. The three-tier structure enables the application logic to run on the server in the middle tier independently of the presentation tier interface and the execution of the database. If there is no request, each part runs on a different machine.There are many benefits to having application logic independent of the presentation and data layers. Developers can use electricity full development tools to develop portable applications without having to use more limited stored procedure languages. A hypervisor can replicate application components to run on multiple machines simultaneously. This distributes the client load across multiple machines for high operational performance. Application component replication is not possible in two-tier and two-tier-half architectures because stored procedures must run in a single database. Application components can share database connections, and in two-tier and two-tier and half-structure systems, the database must establish a connection for each user. Access to business databases and other databases is through local protocols and application interfaces, not through data gateways. This improves runtime"
"and two-tier and half-structure systems, the database must establish a connection for each user. Access to business databases and other databases is through local protocols and application interfaces, not through data gateways. This improves runtime performance and allows applications to control access to their data.The three-tier architecture is divided into B/S/S mode and C/S/S mode. In recent years, Internet/Intranet technology has been widely used all over the world. Internet-based C/S three-tier structure, that is, B/S/S structure enterprise solutions emerge as the times require. The C/S three-tier structure of the Internet mode takes the web server as the presentation layer and puts a large number of business processing programs on the application server as the application layer. The database is placed on the database server as the data layer, that is, the web server + application server. Compared with the traditional C/S structure, the three-layer structure of Internet mode has greater advantages. Because the Internet supports the low-level TCP/IP protocol, the Internet network can be seamlessly connected with almost all local area networks currently used, thus completely solving the connection problem between heterogeneous systems. Because the Internet method adopts \"thin client,\" the system is completely open, and the system does not limit the number of users who will be accessed.

"systems. Because the Internet method adopts \"thin client,\" the system is completely open, and the system does not limit the number of users who will be accessed. Since the system is relatively centralized and on several servers, it is easier to maintain and expand the system. For example, if the database storage space is not enough, you can add another database server. To add functions to the system, the original program can be modified, or a new server can be added to run new functions without doing anything on the client side. The interface is unified and the operation is relatively simple. It is highly portable, and as long as it is an application server that supports J2EE/Java, the application can be directly published and used without any modification. According to the above analysis combined with the characteristics of the users of the electricity company, the system application distribution architecture is as follows:(1)The system consists of five large host groups, CTI server, queuing, and related network and storage, including business database group, application server group, WEB server group, statistical analysis server group, and unified interface server group.(2)The main functions of the business database group are to run the business database to store data, run the accounting module, run the workflow and task management background module, and run the data audit background module.(3)The main function of the application server group is to run the intermediate"
"are to run the business database to store data, run the accounting module, run the workflow and task management background module, and run the data audit background module.(3)The main function of the application server group is to run the intermediate business logic of marketing management, business acceptance, payment, statistical query, authority management, and resource management.(4)The main function of the web server group is to run webserver and provide web access management and web interface.(5)The main function of the query statistical analysis server is to run the statistical background process, which is responsible for extracting the statistical base table from the business database and storing the statistical analysis data and data mart.(6)The main function of the unified interface server is to provide protocol conversion of external real-time interfaces and data message format conversion. And, it is responsible for calling the services of the middle layer or directly extracting some data from the background database.3.2.2. System DivisionDesign ideas according to the overall architecture of the application system, we divide all modules of the electricity marketing technical support system into customer service system, business processing system, electricity billing system, personnel and task management system, measurement management system, external interface system, report management system, monitoring operation, and maintenance system. All systems are based on"
"business processing system, electricity billing system, personnel and task management system, measurement management system, external interface system, report management system, monitoring operation, and maintenance system. All systems are based on the unified model data model, and each system has its complete function.(1)Customer service system. All levels of dealing with customers belong to the customer service system. It includes access management, agent management, business expansion functions, payment acceptance, query management, complaints, suggestions, consultation, and query. The business expansion function refers to the function of the front desk to accept business. After the business expansion is accepted, a work ticket will be passed to the business processing system. After the payment is accepted, the payment work order will be transmitted to the electricity bill accounting.(2)Business processing system. This system is mainly used by staff who handle background business expansion. The system obtains work tickets from the customer service system, and after processing them one by one, finally establishes, changes, and confirms customer data. In terms of software design, componentization of business processing links, process automation and flexibility, and unified management of work tasks are the core of the system.(3)Electricity billing system.

"links, process automation and flexibility, and unified management of work tasks are the core of the system.(3)Electricity billing system. Including meter reading, accounting, payment processing, accounting processing, accounting management, arrears management, and many other contents. The most important thing in electricity billing is to establish a set of configurable customer electricity billing algorithms.(4)Authority management system. Including employee management, authority management, organization management, and task management. The core content of the system is to establish a configurable and flexible authority organization management.(5)Measurement management system. Establish a management system for the life cycle of measuring equipment.(6)External interface system.

"and maintenance management of network, host, database, and middleware. Provide the display of key KPI indicators of system operation and indicators of the quality of marketing work.The customer service system mainly includes the following contents: the construction target of the customer service system. One of the key points of system construction is to provide services to customers. Its purpose is the system integration construction for customer service. That is, the original 95598 system, online business hall system, and marketing system use shared information models and information data. At the same time, the application service layer is shared, and the access layer is managed uniformly. Functional integration for customer service. That is to clean up the original system functions, integrate processes, organize functions around customer service, and simplify the interface and functions of front-end operations. Such as the integration of high-voltage new installations, low-voltage new installations, and new residential installations into new business installations. Integrate high-pressure capacity increase, high-pressure capacity reduction, low-pressure capacity increase, and low-pressure capacity reduction into capacity changes, etc., in line with the requirements of the electricity company to establish a customer service center.

From the application software, it satisfies the organization management, authority management, business process management, monitoring, and assessment management of the customer service center.3.3. Hardware Technology System and Network Platform3.3.1. Marketing System Network Wide Area Network DesignThe reliability of the wide area network channel is one of the most worrying problems in the construction of the provincial centralized mode marketing management information system. To build a centralized marketing management information system in the whole province, to ensure its normal operation, the requirements for network bandwidth are very high. The existing marketing management information system running in the C/S mode is running on the local area network of the local municipal bureau with a bandwidth of 100M, and the response is no problem. If the B/S mode is used, the network overhead brought by the construction is greater than that of the original C/S mode system. Under B/S, there are mainly two types of ping-pong data exchange and bulk data transmission, and the calculation methods of the occupied bandwidth are different. The formula for estimating the bandwidth occupied by a ping-pong data exchange is as follows:(1)whereNis the number of users exchanging data,Tis the user think time,Kis the number of packets exchanged per direction in either direction,Mis"
"are different. The formula for estimating the bandwidth occupied by a ping-pong data exchange is as follows:(1)whereNis the number of users exchanging data,Tis the user think time,Kis the number of packets exchanged per direction in either direction,Mis the number of bytes per packet in either direction, andPis the one-way network delay time.The key parameters in bulk data transfer are the number of bytes transferred and the maximum transfer time that the end user can tolerate. Without information about the end user's tolerance for transmission time, the bandwidth used for transmission cannot be accurately estimated. This is because high-volume data transfers tend to consume as much bandwidth as possible. A simple formula for bandwidth estimation in bulk data transfer mode is as follows:(2)whereFis the size of the bulk data to be transmitted,Ois the protocol overhead factor, andRis the required end-user transmission time. The overhead factor indicates the necessary TCP/IP and link-layer overhead for each TCP segment.WAN lines are nothing more than leased telecommunications lines or owned lines. Whether it is a leased line or its own line, the bandwidth can reach more than 100 M. Restricted by the telecommunications network, more leased lines may use 155 M or even higher. If you use your own line, you can set the network interface bandwidth to 155 M or GE, which fully meets the wide area network bandwidth requirements of the marketing management application system."
"network, more leased lines may use 155 M or even higher. If you use your own line, you can set the network interface bandwidth to 155 M or GE, which fully meets the wide area network bandwidth requirements of the marketing management application system. Considering the reliability of the network, it is recommended to apply for a 2-8 M telecom line outside the marketing proprietary wide area network as a backup line for the wide area network of the marketing system. The headquarters network of the provincial company is the core of the electricity marketing network. The core of its local area network can be composed of two high-performance multilayer switches, and the two multilayer switches are interconnected by two or more gigabit ethernet links. It is recommended to configure two WAN routers to realize the WAN connection between the marketing private network and the backup network, respectively. Configure the corresponding router interface card according to the application situation of the WAN link. The WAN router of the marketing dedicated network is required to support 18 155 M or GE interfaces. The standby network WAN router requires 18 2 M or 18 × 4 2 M interfaces, and 4 2 M link bundling capabilities. The WAN router also provides at least 3 gigabit ethernet ports for connecting to the local area network. The municipal company WAN router of the secondary node can use one to complete the connection of the electricity marketing private network and the backup network. Of"
"also provides at least 3 gigabit ethernet ports for connecting to the local area network. The municipal company WAN router of the secondary node can use one to complete the connection of the electricity marketing private network and the backup network. Of course, it can also be similar to the WAN router in the headquarters of the provincial company, using two to complete the connection of the private network and the backup network, respectively. The municipal company LAN system is connected to the entire provincial electricity marketing system network through the ethernet interface of the municipal company WAN router of the secondary node. The municipal company WAN router is configured with at least one router, providing one 155 M or GE port, one to four 2 M dedicated line interfaces, and at least one gigabit ethernet port. The specific network product model and configuration are selected and determined according to the actual situation of the user's WAN link.3.3.2. Provincial Company Headquarters LAN DesignThe core of the provincial local area network will be composed of two intelligent multilayer switches. The ethernet link binding technology is used between the two core switches to realize link redundancy backup and expand the LAN backbone bandwidth. The two core switches provide Layer 3 routing functions at the same time and use routing redundancy backup protocols such as VRRP or HSRP to implement routing redundancy backup between different VLANs. When one switch fails,"
"the LAN backbone bandwidth. The two core switches provide Layer 3 routing functions at the same time and use routing redundancy backup protocols such as VRRP or HSRP to implement routing redundancy backup between different VLANs. When one switch fails, another switch can take over all the services on the faulty device without affecting the normal operation of the entire service system. Between the WAN router and the LAN core switch, a firewall is used for network security isolation to enhance network security. The two core switches form the backbone of the local area network of the provincial company headquarters, connecting the marketing management system application servers, including WebServer, ApplicationServer, DataServer, and other application system servers. At the same time, it is connected to the access switch to connect the application system client terminals distributed on different floors of the office building to the marketing network system. The marketing management system WebServer, ApplicationServer, and DataServer will contain multiple servers, providing high-reliability technologies such as server clusters to ensure the normal operation of the application system. For the core resource database server of the marketing management system, it is recommended to use a network firewall to strengthen network access control before accessing the local area network. SAN mainly provides storage space for database servers and provides backup. The local area network of"
"marketing management system, it is recommended to use a network firewall to strengthen network access control before accessing the local area network. SAN mainly provides storage space for database servers and provides backup. The local area network of the provincial company headquarters also provides the interface between the marketing network and other application systems, including the SMS platform system, the online business hall, and the banking and telecommunications networking system concentrated in the provincial company headquarters. Including control systems, dispatching systems, emergency repair systems, financial systems, GIS systems, call centers, etc., which are applied in provincial company headquarters and municipal companies. Some other business application systems will require connection with other networks. It is recommended to use firewalls for network security isolation when connecting the local area network with other networks to improve the security of the entire system. For example, the online business hall system and the banking system need to be connected to other untrusted networks. It is recommended to strengthen security access control through network firewalls. In the application system deployment of the provincial company headquarters, 4 web servers need to be configured. To enable the four web servers to provide a unified access interface, it is recommended to deploy the web server behind an application load-balancing device. The load"

To enable the four web servers to provide a unified access interface, it is recommended to deploy the web server behind an application load-balancing device. The load balancing is judged by checking the 4-7 layers of information of the data packet, and the load balancing of the four web servers is realized by applying the load balancing device. The two configured application load balancing devices back up each other to provide high reliability and ensure high system reliability.4. Experiment and Analysis4.1. Test Data Samples and IndicatorsThe experimental data samples in this paper are all composed of data generated when the collection system is running. According to the experimental test indicators, the formula used in this paper is as follows. The samples are divided into positive samples and negative samples. The positive samples are predicted as positive samples as true positive (TP), the positive samples are predicted as negative samples as false negative (FN), and the negative samples are predicted as positive samples as false positive (FP); negative samples predicted as negative samples are true negative (TN). So there isP= TP + FN,N=FP + TN.(3)4.2.

"Bandwidth Estimation Test for Bulk Data Transfer ModeThe peak of a large amount of data generally occurs in the information query without any restrictions, and we use the mean value to consider. Comparing the value output by the system with the century value, the results obtained are shown in Table1.Table  1.Transmission mode bandwidth system estimates compared with actual values.Number12345678System value6.04.88.610.17.58.29.37.8Actual value6.04.88.510.17.68.29.37.8From Table1, we can see that the difference between the estimated value of the system and the actual value is very small. It can be shown that the system has a high accuracy rate in this regard.4.3. System Function TestEach test is more than 1000 times, and the average value is taken after the test, and a total of 8 test results are obtained.(1)System delay: this indicator is also a very important indicator in the system.

It can be seen that the delay of the system is very small, which proves the efficiency of the system to transmit data.(2)System downtime rate: this indicator is one of the most important indicators of the electricity marketing information system, which is related to whether the system can complete the basic functions efficiently and accurately.

As can be seen from the figure, the downtime rate of the system is very low, which can prove that the system is very stable.(3)System precision rate: the system accuracy rate is one of the important indicators to ensure the accurate transmission of system data. If the precision rate is too low, it will affect the user experience and reduce trust. The same method of taking the average of 8 experiments is adopted, and the results obtained are shown in Figure4. It can be seen that the precision of the system is very high and can meet the needs of users.(4)False alarm rate: the false alarm rate of the electricity marketing information system is a very important indicator. If the false alarm rate is too high, it will affect the accuracy and efficiency of the system and is not conducive to the normal management of electricity marketing information. The method of taking the average value of 8 experiments is also adopted, and the results obtained are shown in Figure5. It can be seen that the false positive rate is within an acceptable error range.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem delay test.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointData interaction accuracy test.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem precision test.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointFalse alarm rate test.5."

ConclusionThe digitalization of the market economy is a feature of the information age. With the continuous deepening of the market-oriented reform of electricity supply and demand in my country in recent years, electricity supply companies are faced with the intervention of market competitors and the intervention of new energy-distributed electricity sources advocated by the state in the electricity grid structure of the distribution network, the electricity supply and demand standards of different customers, and intelligent grid operation monitoring standard. All of them indicate the fierce competition of the new electricity market economy under the reform of the electricity system and face new industry development trends such as the relationship between electricity supply and demand. This requires the State Grid Corporation of China, which has the right to operate, to summarize and practice the management and control methods and standards corresponding to market development as soon as possible, so as to achieve the ability to quickly deal with various electricity problems. The new generation of electricity marketing management information systems based on network technology is the only way to improve the market competition of"

The new generation of electricity marketing management information systems based on network technology is the only way to improve the market competition of electricity marketing and improve the efficiency of service feedback in the information age. Starting from all aspects of the electricity marketing business, a digital model is established, and through the digital collection, aggregation, storage, and real-time extraction of information, it can effectively deal with the electricity disputes that are difficult to solve in the daily electricity customer service work. This will further improve the customer service satisfaction of electricity consumption and establish a benign supply-demand relationship and a stable customer base, which is conducive to the expansion and deepening of the electricity market.

"AbstractThe construction of the economic management information system ensures the flow and sharing of information, business coordination, and scientific decision-making between economic functions. Therefore, project construction is absolutely necessary and urgent. Project management has achieved significant results in terms of shortening project time and reducing management costs. Information system is an important model information structure in artificial intelligence. This paper focuses on the design of a fusion method for economic management problems based on decision information systems. This paper summarizes the value of the whole project through the research on the project management of the economic management information system. The results of this study show that when the threshold is fixed, the information granularity Gtheta and rough entropy (Er) theta decrease monotonically with increasing attribute subset cardinality. Meanwhile,θ-information granularity Etheta andθ-information entropy Htheta monotonically increase with the increase of attribute subset cardinality, which indicates that when attribute subset cardinality increases, the uncertainty of the information system decreases.1.

"international economic downturn and domestic difficulties have overlapped with each other, and the unstable and uncertain factors in economic operation have increased [1,2]. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to accurately judge the economic situation and take effective measures in a timely manner [3]. The importance of removing redundant data without changing the data structure, such as attribute approximation and decision rules, and how to mine potentially useful information [4-8]. A large amount of data have been generated in all fields of human production and life [9-12]. These data types are becoming more and more complex in type and are still expanding in size, resulting in high-dimensional massive data information of complex types and formats [13-15]. This thesis takes economic management information system project management as the research object, first carries out the theoretical review related to project management, then a brief overview of the economic MIS is given, and on this basis, the elements of the economic MIS are analyzed.

"project is summarized.Integration development is subject to realistic conditions and in the form of market economy, which brings its complexity. In a competitive market, whether an enterprise grasps and effectively handles information in a timely manner is the key to success or failure. The power of information technology, represented by computer technology, lies precisely in its ability to change product development, product production processes, disrupt industrial structures and economic environments and break the competitive balance. The application of information technology in the field of production management has produced management information systems and decision support systems, which can greatly improve the ability of enterprises to process information and promote the effective use of human resources and capital, so as to realize the optimal allocation of resources, reduce intermediate losses, and enhance the market competitiveness of enterprises. With the help of information technology, the study of integration methods, manufacturing enterprise management informationization, and scientific decision-making has practical significance and value.The innovations of this paper are as follows: (1) an object set-based reduction algorithm is established for property reversion in the context of set-valued decision-making message systems.

"reduction algorithm is established for property reversion in the context of set-valued decision-making message systems. Based on this, a kind of distinguishable object is constructed. The set attribute reduction algorithm uses the set of distinguishable object sets, calculates the minimum disjunction paradigm to solve all the distribution reduction and maximum distribution reduction, and validates the effectiveness of the algorithm by using case analysis. (2) A heuristic dynamic attribute reduction algorithm is proposed for the dynamic increase of attribute sets in the set value determination message network by introducing the concepts of conditional information quantity and attribute importance when the new attribute set is added to the decision information. In the system, the algorithm can use the attribute reduction result of the original system to quickly update the attribute reduction after the attribute set is added, reversely eliminate the redundant attributes that may exist in the updated attribute reduction, and maintain the knowledge acquisition, it further analyzes the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm through case verification.

"outlook of the economic management information system project are presented.2. Proposed Method2.1. Related WorkThe message based on information is an essential artificial intelligence model. It is an important research content of information system. As an evaluation tool, it is an important research topic of machine learning. Therefore, Shankaranarayanan et al. have suggested that the design and configuration of these systems must reflect an assessment of the cost-benefit trade-offs of meeting technical and functional requirements. In their research, they developed a framework for designing marketing information systems for economically driven evaluation programs. The architecture protects against the penalties associated with delayed implementation by defining different design strategies that take into account the uncertainty of exploitation, the variations in cost, as well as the performance between technologies. Their evaluation highlights the conditions under which this design strategy outperforms other design strategies [16]. The Canellas et al. study found that decision-makers were often asked to provide incomplete information as a basis for their decisions. The right decision is determined by the higher overall rating option. Efforts are measured as a count of the basic information processes required for each strategy to make a decision. The results show that (1) the matching of situational features and natural decision-making makes the accuracy of the heuristic"
"rating option. Efforts are measured as a count of the basic information processes required for each strategy to make a decision. The results show that (1) the matching of situational features and natural decision-making makes the accuracy of the heuristic strategy the closest to the analysis strategy; (2) the variability of the heuristic strategy's distribution of effort requirements for each total information level suggests that it is not always as beneficial as previously shown; (3) the trade-off between information imbalance and total information provides new guidance for the restrictive design of decision support systems and the guidance of incomplete information scenarios and ideas [17]. The watershed information system (RBIS) proposed by Franziska and Sven, not only meets the needs of a research project but also focuses on generic functions, scalability, and adherence to standards common in interdisciplinary environmental research [18]. Laslo and Gurevich proposed a simulation-based decision support system to manage the IT portfolio. \"Optimization\" projects are identified by constraining time and cost plan alternatives at decision points and evaluating updated opportunity portfolio budgets for alternative project options therein. These \"optimize\" as well as the evaluation are stochastic processes based on Monte Carlo calculations.

"therein. These \"optimize\" as well as the evaluation are stochastic processes based on Monte Carlo calculations. Stochastic processes are appropriate because they can analyze information at much lower layers and provide results that are more precise than the inadequate deterministic processes that mainly produce erroneous results [19]. The above-mentioned related research results mostly evaluate the impact of incomplete information, or the management evaluation of a certain product, and the evaluation angle of project management is relatively single.To help compare existing models in the literature and highlight their contributions to the literature, the literature analysis in Table1is enumerated;1.Literature review.[16], a framework for constructing a marketing information system for evaluating project designReflect an assessment of cost-benefit trade-offs.[17], examined the effect of incomplete information on the effort and accuracy of decision-making strategiesNormative rational strategies (multi-attribute utility theory, MAUT) and psychological heuristic strategies (take the best strategy, TTB) were evaluated.[18], river basin information system (RBIS)RBIS is designed to manage different types of environmental data with and without spatial context and a rich set of metadata[19], simulation-based decision support systemAbility to optimize each project plan based on alternative determinations of time and cost opportunity constraints and evaluate alternative project"

Information System TheoryCurrently, the attribute simplification of rough set model is mainly for static information systems. In the era of big data, a large amount of real-time data are added to the information system all the time. The dynamic change objects of data in information systems tend to increase with time. It is more difficult to extract useful knowledge from dynamic data by static attribute approximation methods in the traditional environment. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to study incremental update methods for rough set data. The incremental update method can make full use of the original knowledge and correlate the new knowledge with the original knowledge. It only needs to update part of the changed data and can acquire new knowledge without recalculating the original knowledge, which can effectively improve the efficiency of knowledge updating.Rough set theory in the classical sense is realized by equivalence relations. It can handle discrete data in information systems without missing data, but not continuous data, and considers knowledge as having classification capability. The more accurate the knowledge is, the"
"classical sense is realized by equivalence relations. It can handle discrete data in information systems without missing data, but not continuous data, and considers knowledge as having classification capability. The more accurate the knowledge is, the stronger the classification capability is and the granularity of the classification becomes smaller. Knowledge representation is expressed in a centralized manner as an information system. If this information system contains both conditional and decision attributes, it is called a decision information system or decision table. Rough set theory is a mathematically soft computing tool. It can effectively analyze and deal with uncertainty and incompleteness problems. It can handle practical applications to compute, analyze, process, and finally deal with data problems in information systems. In imperfect information transfer environments, it is not possible to use the classical equivalence relations of rough sets for division. However, in real situations, information systems do have incomplete and missing information, so it is necessary to use other extension relations to deal with complete information.S{U,C} is the information system,Uis the set of targets, andCis the set of properties of terms.Vc= ∪aecVa,Va= {a(x) :x∈U} be the domain of values in conditional propertya, wherea(x) represents values of itemsxbelow propertya,x∈U, DT (U,C∪D) is the information network for decision-making,Uis the set of objects,Cis the set of"

Experiments3.1. Experimental Tools and Experimental DesignIn order to be able to better regulate the experimental content, the experiments in this paper were conducted through simulated experiments conducted over school teachers and students. To better compare the correctness of the system, the final score of the device of the system was compared with the score given at the end of the case, and the agreement was correct.The system was deployed on the network server for one month, and it worked well during the period. After the teachers and students of the lab log in, the modules were tested, and found that the average response time of each level of functions was less than 3 seconds. At the same time, the LoadRunner test tool is used for stress testing. Since the system is a dedicated system, the number of people on the line will not be particularly large. During the test, 100 users were simulated to access concurrently, and the correct user names and passwords were provided for the 100 simulated users. It was found that the system could be accessed normally. For operations that modify data, the correct rate of the database is also within acceptable limits.3.1.1.

"100 simulated users. It was found that the system could be accessed normally. For operations that modify data, the correct rate of the database is also within acceptable limits.3.1.1. Overall TestBecause the system will give a score result for each plan to be evaluated. Therefore, if the system is not correct, then the re-improvement of each function design is futile. In this chapter, the data of this case are input into the system. If the final score of the equipment calculated by the system is consistent with the score given at the end of the case, the system is considered correct.3.2. Experimental Data CollectionCommunication information uses (1) interactive communication, through multiparty information exchange between conferences, telephone calls, instant messaging, video conferencing, etc., which ensures that the project team finally agrees on a certain issue. (2) Push communication, through mail, fax, log, news, memo, and other means to ensure that the information is received by the project team, but can not guarantee delivery or be fully understood. (3) Pull-type communication through the intranet, online courses, knowledge base, etc., requires the recipient of the information to access by itself, it is suitable for scenarios with a large amount of information and a large number of people. Management communication requires multilevel and multidirectional processing of project information, such as generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, etc.,"
"for scenarios with a large amount of information and a large number of people. Management communication requires multilevel and multidirectional processing of project information, such as generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, etc., according to the communication management plan formulated in the planning communication management process. This process must ensure that beneficial communication between the project teams is indeed achieved.For this stage of work, not only the completion of communication but also the communication information can be correctly understood by the other party and create opportunities for more in-depth information exchange. In particular, although some casual discussions can also be called meetings, in order to achieve better communication, the meeting recommends a formal way to determine the time, place, and meeting matters. The typical approach is to draw up a discussion item checklist and circulate in advance. During the implementation of this project, interactive communication is mainly used, and push communication is also used every day. In particular, it is necessary to explain that the project is complicated and the system is complicated.4. Discussion4.1.

Due to changes in legal regulations, the situation of project stakeholders is often risky because it is difficult to control.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4.2. Risk AssessmentAs shown in Table3, risk assessment is to assess risk through qualitative analysis and rank the risks according to the degree of risk impact. In project management, we hope to quantify the risk as much as possible; that is, try to determine the probability of occurrence of various results. Risk analysis can be quantitatively analyzed through quantitative analysis of risks. This project is based on the expert decision-making method. Because the economic management information system is a relatively mature system from a commercial point of view, the entrusted development company has more development experience, staff training is in place, and project management has accumulated a large number of actual combat cases. Expert analysis and decision-making are more in line with actual needs. The experience of experts is generally credible in practical work. The requirements in the quantitative analysis of many project risks give different risk probabilities and different risk losses of several projects. The requirements for accuracy are not high, so the expert decision-making method is adopted. The results of quantitative analysis of project risks"

"demand analysis and business analysis, the overall goals, phased goals, and design plans of the project are put forward. The research results provide certain help for improving work efficiency and increasing the accuracy and pertinence of data analysis. However, there are still some shortcomings in the actual construction and use process. For example, in the information acquisition stage, effective economic information cannot be quickly identified, and manual data screening and collection are still relied upon. In addition, the design of this paper fails to establish an effective connection with the big data analysis system. If the power of big data analysis is used, the operating efficiency of the system can be further improved.It is certain that in the future, the information management system is not only a technical means to improve office automation, but more importantly, in the implementation process of the information system, it will have a profound impact on the management thinking, management organization structure, and management methods of the enterprise.

"AbstractIn the current enterprise competition, the core of the management information system is the financial management information system. Building a more comprehensive and efficient financial management information system can effectively establish a more efficient innovative enterprise and promote the transformation and development of the enterprise. This paper first designs a set of financial management system templates, including general ledger, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Second, according to the characteristics of wireless sensor network technology, this paper proposes a financial management system based on the wireless sensor network and designs a load balancing topology control algorithm (LHTCA algorithm), which balances the energy consumption of network nodes and helps to improve the network life cycle. Finally, the management system is tested and validated. The test results show that the financial management system can realize the electronicization of financial data and paperless vouchers, improve the efficiency of financial work, and promote the sharing and integration of resources.1.

"choice to adapt to the development of the times, and information technology is an important means to help enterprises achieve digital transformation. Enterprise development requires an information platform that can support enterprise development, strengthen centralized financial management, complete more online audit work, and reduce operational risks. In the economic and social development plan proposed by my country, it is emphasized that the digital economy innovation leads the development plan and completes the new infrastructure construction. Therefore, enterprises should pay attention to the huge advantages brought by the financial management information system to the enterprise and build a more complete financial management. Information system promotes the development and progress of enterprises. Digital management can not only realize the integration of enterprise management information but also help enterprises to achieve a qualitative leap in their management level.The information construction of enterprise financial management can promote the improvement of the economic benefit level of the enterprise, which is mainly reflected in the improvement of the business performance of the enterprise, the reduction of transaction costs within the enterprise, the improvement of the overall work efficiency of the enterprise, the reduction of material waste, save costs, reduce the workload of corporate financial staff, and reduce work intensity [1,2].

"costs within the enterprise, the improvement of the overall work efficiency of the enterprise, the reduction of material waste, save costs, reduce the workload of corporate financial staff, and reduce work intensity [1,2]. At the same time, the valuable experience of many successful enterprises in my country also proves that the information construction of enterprise financial management has indeed played a huge role in promoting the economic benefits and management level of enterprises. In addition, in the past, the financial management information system could not meet the current situation [3-8]. Therefore, to build a more complete financial management information system, enterprises must pay attention to avoid problems with enterprise information and affect the operation of the enterprise.The wireless sensor network is an intelligent and comprehensive information system that integrates information collection, information transmission, and information processing [9-13]. This is not only the most active research field but also has broad application prospects. Because the system integrates the following four technologies, it can perceive, monitor, and collect various types (regions) information in real time: one is embedded computer computing; the other is sensors; the third is distributed information; the fourth is communication technology [14,15]. It has the ability to obtain and process information and finally send the information to the user. Based on wireless sensors,"
"computer computing; the other is sensors; the third is distributed information; the fourth is communication technology [14,15]. It has the ability to obtain and process information and finally send the information to the user. Based on wireless sensors, humans can obtain all kinds of useful information anytime, anywhere. In short, no matter from which aspect, it has a strong application prospect and has very considerable practical value and scientific research value, especially in various fields such as antiterrorism, industry and agriculture, rescue and disaster relief, environmental monitoring, military, and national defense, increasingly important role [16]. It is precisely because of this that it has been called the most influential technology in this century and has attracted great attention from all walks of life in all countries and fields.From the analysis of research level, the wireless sensor network is undoubtedly a brand-new scientific research [17]. Relevant workers are required to deeply study the basic theory and verify the analysis in actual construction. Network management is a crucial part of it. What is network management? As the name implies, it effectively monitors the communication equipment and transmission system of the network and performs related operations such as control and diagnostic testing, and through these measures, the network performance is greatly improved. Network management is one of the important factors to ensure the stable, safe,"
"system of the network and performs related operations such as control and diagnostic testing, and through these measures, the network performance is greatly improved. Network management is one of the important factors to ensure the stable, safe, reliable, and efficient operation of sensor networks. The effective solution to the problems of system heterogeneity, shared resources, network autonomy, and similarity is the sensor network, that is, to achieve unified management and maintenance of system resources, resource configuration, communication, performance, and faults, to ensure that the network system is efficient and reliable operation [18,19]. Overview of the research status in this field, combined with the existing typical network management system, on this basis, the wireless sensor network management system is designed, and the monitoring and management are realized to make it play the best performance.The world' first wireless sensor network management framework MANNA was proposed by Ruiz et al. It is a network management system based on policy integration. It dynamically collects management information and maps it to the design model. On this basis, it executes related services and management functions [20,21]. The model maintains the entire network state. Network management can be implemented based on specific operating conditions. Related management functions. It integrates the following three levels of wireless sensor network management: one is the management"
"The model maintains the entire network state. Network management can be implemented based on specific operating conditions. Related management functions. It integrates the following three levels of wireless sensor network management: one is the management function, the other is the logical management layer, and the third is the wireless sensor network. Based on the design goals of self-organization, self-healing, self-diagnosis, and self-management, MANNA's design philosophy separates network applications from network applications. The functional system, information system, and physical system constitute the MANNA management structure.WinMSI is a sensor network management system, which is formed based on policies and can fully improve network performance due to its self-management function advantages. It can realize unattended and still manage network nodes efficiently. WinMS can be reconfigured in combination with the current network characteristics, including data in the data aggregation tree, MAC protocol, and powerful management functions such as collection and distribution. It can self-govern a single node according to the neighbor network status. At the same time, using the network management mode, it can perform management; centralized network management mode performs effective prevention, correction, and other management functions according to the global information of the wireless sensor network. On the basis of the above, WinMS proposes the management function of"
