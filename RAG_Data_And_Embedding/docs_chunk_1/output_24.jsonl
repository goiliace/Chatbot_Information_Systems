"[18,20,28]. HIV/TB coinfection can accelerate the reduction in immune resistance and increase the risk of TB incidence and death. Patients with sputum smear positivity not only have a large amount of bacterial discharge and strong infectivity but also have a higher severity. Retreatment of TB is mostly complex and serious, mostly due to irregular or unreasonable chemotherapy. Therefore, it is more difficult to retreat TB than to provide initial treatment, making the mortality rate higher. TB recurrence has become a challenge in the prevention and control of TB in China. The success rate of retreated patients is lower than that of newly treated patients. The low cure rate of retreated TB is the root cause of drug-resistant TB, especially multidrug-resistant TB, which seriously hinders TB prevention and treatment. Therefore, the relevant departments should strengthen TB publicity and education of retreated patients and actively study effective treatment programs for drug-resistant TB.In the end TB strategy [29], the World Health Organization proposed that the number and incidence rate of TB-related deaths may decrease by 95% and 90%, respectively, in 2035. To achieve this, the government, medical institutions, and TB prevention and control departments need to collaborate to fully implement the DOTS strategy. In China, the DOTS strategy has been fully promoted and achieved some results. However, the relevant departments cannot relax their vigilance and further measures are"
"and control departments need to collaborate to fully implement the DOTS strategy. In China, the DOTS strategy has been fully promoted and achieved some results. However, the relevant departments cannot relax their vigilance and further measures are needed to strengthen the tracking, follow-up, and management of male, elderly, HIV-positive, retreated, and smear-positive TB patients, to further improve the treatment success rate. Focusing on adverse reactions and complications in administering antituberculosis treatment at an early stage will help improve the antiviral treatment effect and reduce the mortality rate [30].This study performed a retrospective cohort analysis. Due to the limitations of the research methods and economic conditions, the survival analysis did not include nutritional risk status, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, social support, tobacco-alcohol, liver and kidney function, T-SPOT, and GeneXpert data. The outcome variable was all-cause death and death caused by tuberculosis was not distinguished from coincidental death from other causes. A future multicenter prospective cohort study is anticipated that will fully consider the relevant influencing factors to establish a more stable risk model.5.

"AbstractBackgroundMany researches on gender differences in leprosy found that female patients were detected with the disease later and had more serious disabilities than male patients. We analyzed the gender differences related to epidemiological characteristics of new leprosy cases detected from 2000 to 2015 in Sichuan Province, China.MethodsA retrospective study was undertaken to analyze the gender differences with respect to age, delay in disease detection, the main modes of detection, and disability grade. The chi-squared test andttest were applied for the comparison using Epi Info 7.2 with a significance level ofa= 0.05. The data were collected from the Leprosy Management Information System in China.ResultsA total of 2900 new leprosy cases were detected from 2000 to 2015, of whom 2075 (71.6%) were male and 825 (28.4%) were female with a gender ratio of 2.5. The gender ratio of patients aged 15-30 was significantly lower than that of patients aged 31-45 and 46-60. Male cases were older than female cases when they were detected. The proportion of Grade 2 Disability (G2D) among men (20.6%) was significantly higher than that among women (17.3%). The average period of delay in detection among male cases was similar with that among females cases.ConclusionsGender-related differences existed among the leprosy cases detected from 2000 to 2015.

"among females cases.ConclusionsGender-related differences existed among the leprosy cases detected from 2000 to 2015. Female patients were younger than male patients. The detection of leprosy in women was not later than in the case of men. The disability situation in men was more serious than in women.IntroductionThe resolution for elimination of leprosy, defined as a prevalence level of below one case per 10,000 population by the year 2000 at a global level, was adopted by the 44th World Health Assembly in 1991. This target was successfully achieved at a global level. The global prevalence of leprosy has declined gradually during the last 15 years, while the number of newly detected cases has been relatively stable with a slight drop.1-4Leprosy not only affects men but also affects women. A study on the impact of leprosy on men and women in Brazil found that leprosy exacerbated existing gender inequalities.5In most Asian countries, leprosy affects men more than women, while in Africa, female patients outnumber males. However, more men than women have been diagnosed with multibacillary (MB) leprosy.6The study on gender differences in Bangladesh found male cases were more than female cases, but women were less aware of leprosy and had fewer opportunities to access the medical services than men, leading to a delay in seeking healthcare, serious disabilities, and social stigma.7The researches in Nigeria on sexual differences indicated that female patients suffered a higher"
"and had fewer opportunities to access the medical services than men, leading to a delay in seeking healthcare, serious disabilities, and social stigma.7The researches in Nigeria on sexual differences indicated that female patients suffered a higher proportion of disabilities than males; women were less aware of causation and symptoms of leprosy and had less access to healthcare coverage than men.8,9Female leprosy cases suffered more isolation, rejection, and social stigma than male cases.10,11There has been no research on gender differences in epidemiological characteristics of leprosy in China. Therefore, it is important to explore gender differences related to delay in detection, type of leprosy, age, disabilities, and detection modes so that more attention can be paid to female leprosy cases. Sichuan Province is located in the southwest of China with a vast area of 480,000 square kilometers and had a population of 82.04 million by the end of 2015. It consists of Han and 14 other minorities. The province has 21 prefectures and cities and 181 counties. In this study, we tried to analyze the gender differences related to epidemiological characteristics of newly detected leprosy cases from 2000 to 2015 in Sichuan Province.Material and MethodsA retrospective study was undertaken to analyze the gender differences in newly detected leprosy cases using descriptive and comparative approaches. The period analyzed in the study began on February 1, 2000, and ended on December 31,"
"and MethodsA retrospective study was undertaken to analyze the gender differences in newly detected leprosy cases using descriptive and comparative approaches. The period analyzed in the study began on February 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2015 (16 years). The data of all patients diagnosed with leprosy in Sichuan were sourced from the Leprosy Management Information System in China, initially collected at the county level, and supervised at the prefecture and provincial levels. Approvals were obtained from the ethics committee of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Leprosy diagnosis should meet at least two of the following four criteria in China:12(i) skin lesion with loss of sensation; (ii) peripheral nerve damage with disabilities; (iii) skin smear positive forMyobacterium leprae; and (iv) pathological examination showing leprosy-specific characteristics.Epidemiological data were entered in an Excel 97 database. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of IBM SPSS software, version 19. The continuous variables were given as \"median\" and \"range.\" The chi-squared test was applied for the comparison between two groups of men and women, and the variables included detection modes, age, delay period, Grade 2 Disabilities (G2D), the WHO classification, and the Ridley-Jopling classification. Thettest was used to analyze the differences of average age and average delay period in the male and female groups. The delay in"
"detection modes, age, delay period, Grade 2 Disabilities (G2D), the WHO classification, and the Ridley-Jopling classification. Thettest was used to analyze the differences of average age and average delay period in the male and female groups. The delay in detection (year) was taken as the interval between the time when the leprosy cases showed symptoms and when they were diagnosed with the disease. The WHO classification of leprosy according to the number of leprosy skin lesions and skin smear examination results is as follows: multibacillary (MB) leprosy when there are six or more skin lesions or less than six skin lesions with a positive skin smear result; and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy in case of one to five skin lesions.13High-endemic areas of leprosy in Sichuan province include Liangshan Yi ethnic, Ganzi Zang ethnic prefecture, and Guangyuan city, relatively less population live in high-endemic area.ResultsTrends in new case detectionA total of 2900 new leprosy cases were detected from 2000 to 2015, of which 2075 (71.6%) were men and 825 (28.4%) were women, with a male/female ratio of 2.5. The provincial epidemiological data of Sichuan province showed the incidence of leprosy from 2000 to 2010 was stable, and the average newly detected cases each year were around 200. An obvious decline was observed from 2011 onward, the number of average new cases each year being around 100 (Table1). The proportions of cases with G2D fluctuated from 13.6% to 29.5% from 2000 to 2015."
"newly detected cases each year were around 200. An obvious decline was observed from 2011 onward, the number of average new cases each year being around 100 (Table1). The proportions of cases with G2D fluctuated from 13.6% to 29.5% from 2000 to 2015. The proportions of MB cases were relatively stable from 2000 to 2011, and an obvious increase was observed from 2012 onward. The proportions of children cases were relatively stable with a slight increase in 2014 and 2015 (Fig.1). The case detection rates (CDRs) of high-endemic areas fluctuated from 2000 to 2010 with the highest CDR (0.224 per 10,000) in 2008; an obvious decrease in CDRs was observed from 2011 onward with the lowest CDR (0.066 per 10,000) in 2014.

The Ridley-Jopling classification is based on clinical features, bacteriologic index, and pathological features, including indeterminant (I), polar tuberculoid (TT), borderline tuberculoid (BT), mid-borderline (BB), borderline lepromatous (BL), and polar lepromatous (LL) leprosy.Endemic situation and ethnic groupThe male/female ratios were similar in the relatively high and low-endemic areas (2.6 vs. 2.4), and there was no difference (χ2= 0.931,P= 0.335).

Of these, 73 (2.5%) were children under 14 years, among whom 51 (66.2%) were male and 22 (33.8%) were female with a ratio of 2.3. There was no significant difference in the sex ratios between adults and children under 14 (χ2= 0.105,P= 0.746). There was no difference between the groups of cases above 60 years and those below 60 either. (χ2= 0.658,P= 0.417). We analyzed the cases aged from 15 to 60 years and found the ratios of men to women were 1.9, 2.6, and 3.0 in the 15 - 30, 31 - 45, and 46 - 60 age groups, respectively. The ratio of the group aged 15 - 30 was significantly different from the group aged 31 - 45 (χ2= 9.596,P= 0.002) and the group aged 46 - 60 (χ2= 16.320,P< 0.001).

We further analyzed the G2D among male and female groups in different endemic areas and ethnic groups. Both in high- and low-endemic areas, the proportions of G2D among men were higher than those among women, but there were no significant differences.

The male/female ratio of the BB group was significantly different from the TT group (χ2= 6.621,P= 0.012) and the LL group (χ2= 4.146,P= 0.042). However, there was no difference between the BT group (χ2= 3.610,P= 0.057), the BL group (χ2= 3.565,P= 0.059), and the I group (χ2= 0.330,P= 0.566). There was no other difference between any other groups (Table3).DiscussionsThe endemic level of leprosy in China was relatively low with regard to prevalence since the 21st century, but the number of newly detected cases each year still lay among the front-ranked countries of the world. The national epidemiological data showed that more men were diagnosed with leprosy than women with a ratio of 2.3 in China.1-4Sichuan province is a relatively high-endemic area in China, 2900 new leprosy cases were detected from 2000 to 2015 with the ratio of men to women being 2.5. The decline of CDRs in men was more obvious than in women. The overall proportion of G2D fluctuated obviously from 13.6% to 29.5% without an obvious trend. The proportions of MB cases increased with the decline of overall endemic situation since 2012.

"The proportions of MB cases increased with the decline of overall endemic situation since 2012. The incidence of children was stable on a relatively low level; children cases in 2014 and 2015 were 4 and 6, respectively, we supposed it was because some children cases were not detected in 2012 and 2013 in time, then were detected with a delay in the following 2 years. The CDR of leprosy in high-endemic areas in 2008 was the highest; we speculated it was because of massive active case detection activities carried out in 2008, extra funds from governments were inputted in leprosy control when an earthquake took place in Sichuan province in 2008. After 2012, an obvious decrease in newly detected leprosy cases was observed in high-endemic areas.Research in India on gender differences in leprosy cases has found that there were more men cases than women cases, especially in rural areas.14Victoria indicates that globally the average male/female ratio was 2:1, but more women could be suffering in silence than men.15John argues that leprosy causes not only physical but also psychosocial and economic problems, especially in the case of women in developing countries.16We did not find that the differences of the male/female ratio in low and high-endemic areas, either in the ethnic and nonethnic areas, implied that men cases dominated in the Sichuan province no matter the endemic or ethnic situation.

"low and high-endemic areas, either in the ethnic and nonethnic areas, implied that men cases dominated in the Sichuan province no matter the endemic or ethnic situation. The ratio of male to female was highest in the ethnic area at 2.7, but there was no significant difference. We assumed that this might be related to the conventional delay in seeking healthcare and a lower access to health services for women in the ethnic area. We felt there was a need for further research.We did not find any significant difference in the average delay period between men and women, and the detection of female cases was not later than in male cases. We studied the delay in different areas further, such as in high-endemic areas and in ethnic areas, but we still did not discover any difference in the delay period between men and women, which was different from the research results on the delay of detection of leprosy from 1984 to 1998 in China. The author found that the delay was greatest in the areas where leprosy was endemic and/or where access to health services was poor.17Our result was not the same as the result of researches in other countries either, for example, Peters ES8found that the average delay of women related to diagnosis and treatment was much longer than that of men, almost twice. Rao observed that the delay in noticing the skin lesions as the symptoms of the disease was higher for women (29 months) than men (24 months), and the delay in seeking medication was higher for women"
"was much longer than that of men, almost twice. Rao observed that the delay in noticing the skin lesions as the symptoms of the disease was higher for women (29 months) than men (24 months), and the delay in seeking medication was higher for women (10 months) than for men (6 months).18Male cases were older than female cases when they were detected, and the ratios of men to women in groups aged 31 - 45 and 46 - 60 were significantly higher than that in the group aged 15 - 30, which implied that female cases were younger than male cases when they were detected. Our result was like the research of Arora in India. The author found that the female cases were more than male cases in the age group 15-35. This might be related to the different hormone levels during the reproductive age.14Van't speculated that women affected by leprosy faced more problems about their marital and sexual relationships than women with physical disabilities in Nepal.19Jose M Ramos analyzed the leprosy patients admitted for long-term treatment in a rural hospital in Nigeria and found that female patients were younger and had a higher mortality rate than male ones.20Leprosy cases have not been sent to leprosaria for treatment since 1982 when multidrug therapy (MDT) started in China; new leprosy cases detected after 1982 were treated at home and in communities.

"(MDT) started in China; new leprosy cases detected after 1982 were treated at home and in communities. The main detection modes of men and women were self-reporting, dermatological clinic, clue check, reporting by others, and contact examination in sequence. The ratio of men to women was highest in the group detected through self-reporting and was lowest in the group detected by contact examination. Men were more likely to be detected through passive modes than women. We assumed that it might be because men mostly worked outside the home and gained more information, while women mostly stayed at home and received less health-related information. There was a need to stress the importance of promoting information about healthcare of leprosy patients, especially for the women at home, to improve early self-reporting among women. John16assessed the needs for quality care among women with leprosy and was convinced about giving a high priority to provide culturally acceptable health education to household women for promoting early reporting. Contact examination, as one of the active case detection modes in China, is worth carrying out due to intradomiciliary transmission of leprosy. Contact examination could find relatively more female cases than male cases, because women are mainly housewives. Our results showed that more men were detected through passive modes, while women through active modes; the results also showed no difference of delay period between women and men. The"
"female cases than male cases, because women are mainly housewives. Our results showed that more men were detected through passive modes, while women through active modes; the results also showed no difference of delay period between women and men. The reality of women mainly being housewives may be a confounding factor which caused bias in the detected age and delay period among female cases and also influenced on health seeking behaviors of women, so there is a need for further research. On the other hand, since the dermatological clinic was the second-most main detection mode, dermatologists needed to know that leprosy may exist for a long time at a low endemic level. So, the training of dermatologists needed to be undertaken regularly for early case detection.In our study, the proportion of G2D among men was significantly higher than in women, and the same situation was observed in the nonethnic areas. However, there was no difference of proportion in G2D among men and women in the ethnic areas, which means that the disability situation of women in the ethnic area was more serious and was like the situation of men. The disability situation of female cases in the ethnic areas needed more attention. We speculated that the behavior of delay in seeking healthcare and manual agricultural activities may be the cause for the serious disability situation in female cases in the ethnic areas. Also, the lower social status of women and inaccessible health services could be the cause"
"of delay in seeking healthcare and manual agricultural activities may be the cause for the serious disability situation in female cases in the ethnic areas. Also, the lower social status of women and inaccessible health services could be the cause of women seeking healthcare late. Rashmi argues that women in developing countries seek any kind of healthcare late, and leprosy as a disease with stigma attached to it could further add to this behavior.21In Nepal, fewer women with leprosy seek treatment than men affected by the disease, and the difference is significant.22Guerrero found that the delay in diagnosis and incidence of disability was greater in women than in men in Colombia.23Researches in Ethiopia and Mali have shown that the incidence of foot ulcers in men was higher than in the case of female patients. This is not because of foot ulcers being underdiagnosed in women but because of the delayed presentation by female patients, which resulted in more serious disability.24,25The most common groups of the Ridley-Jopling classification of men and women include LL, BL, BT, TT, BB, and IL successively. We found the ratios of men to women in LL, BL, BT, TT, BB, and IL groups were 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.9, 1.6, and 2.0, respectively. The ratio of men to women in the BB group was significantly lower than in the TT and LL groups, indicating that women were more likely to have the BB type of leprosy with an unstable immune condition.

"The ratio of men to women in the BB group was significantly lower than in the TT and LL groups, indicating that women were more likely to have the BB type of leprosy with an unstable immune condition. We did not find any difference in the proportion of male and female cases in the MB group, and so our findings were different from the reported results of other researches. The researches6,20,26,27in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nepal, Brazil, and Malawi have revealed that in the MB category, the proportion of men cases was much higher than that of women cases. We assumed that this might be due to the endemic level of leprosy in China being lower than that in the countries mentioned above.Several limitations should be taken into consideration in our study. All the data were collected by health workers at the county level and supervised at the city and provincial levels. Some of the data were incomplete. We did not have the social-economic details of new leprosy cases, such as their educational level, marital status, and occupation, which could have a significant influence on healthcare-seeking behavior. We also do not have sufficient information about cultural and religious aspects among female cases, which could influence the health seeking behaviors of women and their social participation.ConclusionDespite the limitations, we understood that the characteristics of new female leprosy patients detected from 2000 to 2015 were different from those of male patients.

"seeking behaviors of women and their social participation.ConclusionDespite the limitations, we understood that the characteristics of new female leprosy patients detected from 2000 to 2015 were different from those of male patients. Female patients were younger and their detection was not later than in the case of men. The disability situation in male patients was more serious than that in female patients. We stress the importance of leprosy control for both men and women. The health education of women in households needs to be promoted. More attention needs to be paid to the disability situation among men patients. However, we have not been able to arrive at any conclusions about gender differences related to health accessibility, healthcare-seeking behavior, and social discrimination.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the health workers for data collection and supervision.

"of tobacco manufacturing, tobacco manufacturing enterprises show the characteristics of strong production capacity, high degree of production automation, and advanced enterprise-level management information system. To promote the modernization of the tobacco industry with information technology is to use the most advanced information technology to fully penetrate the production, circulation, and management process of the tobacco industry. Change the traditional production and operation mode, accelerate the adjustment of the tobacco industry and product structure, and improve the management system of the tobacco industry. Meet the needs of the market and consumers, improve the ability to adapt to the market, and enhance the overall competitive strength. The development of industry informatization is closely related to the joint reorganization of enterprises, the integrated group management of assets, and the synergy of industrial and commercial information, but it is also dynamic. It can be said that the success of its construction is an important symbol of the strength of the industry. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study and explore the implementation strategies of industry informatization construction. The reason is that the wide range of tobacco R&D business leads to the problems of large volume, multifarious types, and scattered storage of tobacco R&D data.

"The reason is that the wide range of tobacco R&D business leads to the problems of large volume, multifarious types, and scattered storage of tobacco R&D data. It is difficult for industry experts who are proficient in tobacco R&D business to effectively mine the value by using the abovementioned complex data [1]. In order to cooperate with the market and brand strategy of the tobacco industry, the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau has made a serious strategic thinking on informatization and customized the overall plan and strategic objectives. In order to build a resource-saving and environment-friendly society, earnestly do a good job of saving energy and reducing consumption in tobacco production, and strive to achieve economical, clean, and safe development, it is necessary to build a mobile data collection system for tobacco companies. In recent years, China's informatization construction has made great progress, and both industries and enterprises have felt various benefits from the application of information technology. The WAP business is also growing at a rapid pace [2], in the context of the deepening of China's reform and opening up and the domestic and international environment of economic globalization. Like all developing enterprises, the problem faced by tobacco enterprise informatization is a problem in development and improvement, and all solutions point to the data center system based on data warehouse.According to the characteristics of business, data, and"
"developing enterprises, the problem faced by tobacco enterprise informatization is a problem in development and improvement, and all solutions point to the data center system based on data warehouse.According to the characteristics of business, data, and users of the tobacco R&D system, a layered technical architecture is adopted to build a user-oriented tobacco R&D system big data cloud platform, encapsulate data collection and storage, and standardize data management. The most direct function of mobile data collection is to provide complete mobile information to relevant mobile management personnel, assisting mobile management personnel to quickly query related data and perform corresponding management operations. In the deployment and development of mobile services, it is often the case that local and municipal mobile companies, according to the different needs of the market, immediately launch corresponding services in order to meet the needs. It is beneficial to quickly meet user needs at that time [3]. In recent years, with the market competition and gradual opening of the domestic telecommunication industry, various telecommunication services have made great progress. The establishment of the data center brings great convenience to the use of standard information and data of the same caliber for all functional departments and related personnel of the enterprise and creates conditions for the effective use of information and data mining [4].

"great convenience to the use of standard information and data of the same caliber for all functional departments and related personnel of the enterprise and creates conditions for the effective use of information and data mining [4]. At the same time, the tobacco purchasing data collection system is the basis of MES implementation. It is mainly responsible for the collection, analysis, processing and continuous, automatic and complete transmission of data, equipment status, personnel, events, time, and other information in the production control layer to provide basic information support for scheduling and commanding production. Monthly report of consumption, tobacco leaf sales, tow purchase and consumption, cigarette paper purchase and consumption, production process industry process business data, and cigarette sales link business data. Reducing the technical requirements of large data analysis for users is an important exploration and attempt for tobacco developers to make use of data-driven tobacco R&D business.In recent years, the tobacco industry has developed unprecedentedly, and it has become the most advanced tobacco production and processing base in Asia with large production scale. Second, mobile operators have been vigorously promoting the development of various value-added services. Different from many traditional services, the development and promotion of new services are often a process of exploration. The exchange and communication of enterprise information"
"been vigorously promoting the development of various value-added services. Different from many traditional services, the development and promotion of new services are often a process of exploration. The exchange and communication of enterprise information are becoming more and more frequent. Collecting enterprise information through mobile mode has become a new way of enterprise information collection. For tobacco enterprises, data center system can realize economic operation analysis, marketing data analysis of provincial companies, marketing data analysis of branch companies, monopoly data analysis, financial data analysis, human resources analysis, etc. [5]. The work orders, process parameters, documents, notices, and instructions generated by the planning layer are sent to the production control layer to respond, guide, and trigger the production site events. Simplify the data analysis process. Let the \"non-data expert users\" of the tobacco research and development system focus more on the tobacco research and development business itself and avoid users facing complex big data analysis technologies and complex tobacco research and development raw data. Analyze the data structure and design the function of the data acquisition subsystem in the unified business platform, which is responsible for the aggregation of data resources for the scattered data.

"acquisition subsystem in the unified business platform, which is responsible for the aggregation of data resources for the scattered data. However, informatization is a process of \"informatization.\" According to the model of informatization construction, tobacco companies have gone through the process of building a large number of process-oriented software for control and have begun to enter the stage of data value-oriented integration and analysis [6]. The ultimate goal of mobile data collection is to gather the collected data into the enterprise production data center, which plays an important role in the work of mobile devices, mobile performance, mobile planning, mobile balance, and mobile forecasting [7].2. Related WorkSince the implementation of the national tobacco monopoly system, China's tobacco industry has made great achievements in \"meeting the consumer demand, improving the quality of tobacco products, increasing the national financial accumulation and supporting the development of national enterprises.\" Bauer established the idea that consumers' rationality is relatively low and plays an important role. He believes that any action of consumers will produce results that he cannot be completely sure of [8]. Ross put forward arbitrage pricing theory. The western financial management theory is coming to maturity. Financial management has developed into a management activity that integrates financial forecasting, financial decision-making, financial planning,"
"Ross put forward arbitrage pricing theory. The western financial management theory is coming to maturity. Financial management has developed into a management activity that integrates financial forecasting, financial decision-making, financial planning, financial control, and financial analysis, with financing management, investment management, working capital management, and profit distribution management as its main contents and occupies a core position in enterprise management [9]. Miller and Mordelli Yanni put forward the famous principle that the capital structure of a company has nothing to do with dividend policy in an efficient securities market [10]. Copeland Kou proposed that the classification of consumer goods into convenience goods, shopping goods, and specialized goods is based on the analysis of consumer behavior in three aspects [11]. Barnes has established various information technologies, mainly based on network technology, provide broader and more advanced technical means and methods for financial management of enterprises, and enterprises can keep the technological lead based on flexible technology [12]. Dr. E.F. Cold put forward the data model and theory of relational database. After long-term business development and demonstration, relational database has been widely used. Since then, the storage and utilization of data have entered a new era [13]. Dean published \"Capital Budget,\" which changed the focus of financial management from the emphasis on"
"development and demonstration, relational database has been widely used. Since then, the storage and utilization of data have entered a new era [13]. Dean published \"Capital Budget,\" which changed the focus of financial management from the emphasis on external financing to the rational allocation of funds within the company, which made a qualitative leap in the company's financial management [14]. Mead published the first book devoted to the financial management of corporate fundraising [15]. Fama and Miller published the book \"Financial Management,\" which is a collection of Western financial management theories, marking the maturity of Western financial management theory [16]. Mr. Chares designed what was then called an integrated data store, the design laid the foundation for a meshed, hierarchical data model, seen as the early days of relational databases in database history [17]. Since the implementation of the national tobacco monopoly system, China's tobacco industry has made great achievements in \"meeting the consumer demand of residents, improving the quality of tobacco products, increasing the national financial accumulation, and supporting the development of national enterprises.\"3.

"SMSIn recent years, short message service has penetrated into the daily life of the public in a variety of ways. With this model, it is easy to store the original detailed data from each data source. And flexible storage of historical data is with enough flexibility classes to meet all requirements. Due to many objective factors such as inaccurate counting of electrical system, shift, clearing of power-off data, completion of work order, trial production, etc., the data collected continuously has a great error [18]. Therefore, the platform generally uses a hierarchical architecture, providing simple data analysis applications and interface services for top-level \"non-data expert users.\" It encapsulates the underlying data aggregation, data storage, subject data services, and other functional modules, as well as the algorithm library and analysis services. The whole enterprise may already have some mobile systems and centralized field control systems, and there will be many scattered mobile meters [19] in the above range. Although data services will occupy an increasing proportion in telecommunication services, voice services are still the most important and basic services for mobile communication systems.

"office automation system weaves a set of efficient and smooth information interconnection system within enterprises and institutions, which greatly promotes the development of productivity of enterprises and institutions. The resulting changes in business process, business processing rules, and business information flow are the three major factors of data acquisition system reconfiguration. It is also a problem that must be considered and solved to build a new data acquisition system [20]. Database integrity constraint is the guiding principle to ensure the data quality in the preprocessing domain of data warehouse. Data warehouse technology is a combination of customer service and business processing information. The unified framework is a data warehouse that provides a scientific basis for enterprise managers to formulate strategies; develop market analysis market; benefit evaluation, public relations, and personal image design; and make decisions by using analysis and mining technology. By collecting data samples from different systems within the enterprise and external data sources, the consistency of data is maintained, and it is easy to be accessed by users. At the same time, these data are organized to facilitate analysis. The specific data quality dimensions include accuracy, uniqueness, compatibility, validity, integrity, and completeness.

Only when reliable data are obtained can correct conclusions be made on the structural performance and the purpose of inspection be achieved. Only reliable data can be used as the basis for judging structural performance or establishing calculation theory.

"activities of tobacco factories are always affected by shift hours, shifts, production days, and work orders. The division of these time periods and the events that occur at alternate time periods are the key to statistical data. The data is sorted when stored, the location of the file is retrieved when new data arrives, the data of the original file is copied and integrated with the new data, the filename of the new file is the same, and the timestamp is updated to the current time. Install the data collection computer, configure the corresponding communication board card in the computer according to the communication mode supported by the meters, and collect the data of the meters into the computer. It is clear that the overall sales volume increases over time.

"number of mobile users is also growing rapidly, and the competition in the mobile communication market is becoming increasingly fierce. By doing so, it can be confirmed that the business requirements are correctly understood and in the next stage. Data warehouse designers get reliable, business-driven data structure, which greatly reduces the cost of maintaining the logical and physical structure of data warehouse in the short, medium, and long term. Through the fast wireless data network and terminal, tobacco company staff can not only extend the office automation system to mobile phone terminals but also manage orders in real time. If it is processed in the program, its running speed cannot meet the needs of users. Therefore, encapsulating statistical operations in stored procedures can greatly improve the efficiency of system operation. This design can effectively reduce users' requirements for big data analysis technology, simplify the operation of big data analysis process, and enable \"non-data expert users\" to use the service conveniently. After patrolling and observing on-site equipment and instruments, operators manually record relevant mobile data on site and then manually enter the mobile data acquisition system.

"WAP enterprise website can be like other applications, without operator restrictions, as long as the mobile phone with WAP function. You can log on the WAP website of the enterprise to view the information at any time, so the WAP website of the mobile phone is an important step in the realization of the wireless information construction of the enterprise.4. Platform Application and Effect4.1. Instance OverviewThe application process and results of the large data cloud platform of tobacco R&D system in Yunnan for users are verified by an example. All data collection points will produce millions or even tens of millions of record values in a day, making it difficult to efficiently process ordinary databases of records of this magnitude. Real-time databases use a variety of optimization and compression storage algorithms. However, there is bound to be the problem of relying on virtual operator, which will restrict the business content and service quality, making it inconvenient to carry out its own characteristic business, and all information must be transferred through service providers, so the security of enterprise information cannot be guaranteed. Actual and predicted sales results for a certain two years are as shown in Figure5.Figure 5(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointActual and predicted results.Figure 5(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointActual and predicted results.Forecast the results in the next two years, as shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure"

Through the existing network environment of tobacco companies and the existing network environment and security measures of telecommunication operators, the service guarantee of telecommunication-level security can be fully guaranteed. To strengthen the management's ability to coordinate and schedule production, tobacco companies are required to process and analyze the collected data in the data collection system, so as to provide direct data support for management decisions. Through the application system, you can view all parts of the mobile data at any time. At the same time, information such as equipment running status, equipment failures, mobile flow information, mobile consumption distribution and statistics, pipe network transmission, and mobile utilization comparison can be viewed through a predetermined data statistical analysis system.

"mobile flow information, mobile consumption distribution and statistics, pipe network transmission, and mobile utilization comparison can be viewed through a predetermined data statistical analysis system. When the location is updated and exchange data, after receiving the location update request, check the user's roaming authority, update its own location information about the user, notify the original to delete the user's data, and then transfer the user's data to the new one. The layers are independent of each other, interact with each other using standard interface, and have the feature of weak coupling, which makes the system have good scalability and stability. IVR voice platform can collect information manually and display information and voice to mobile phone users. Business architecture is the current or future period of time for an enterprise. The overall way of business management is reflected, and the impact of business architecture on information systems is very important. Information systems and related information processes serve business architecture requirements. Understanding the actual situation of tobacco quality monitoring, real-time analysis of the use of laboratory equipment, use saturation, etc. to ensure the stability of tobacco product quality and style is a typical large data analysis application scenario.4.2.

"ensure the stability of tobacco product quality and style is a typical large data analysis application scenario.4.2. Instance ImplementationThe results of physical and chemical experiments on tobacco and its raw materials, flavors and spices, materials, etc. were obtained through the experimental analysis process. View the wear and tear data of moving in the production, conversion, transfer, and use link of each part according to custom conditions. These two processes have been monotonous in the past, but as the demand for personalized services becomes stronger and stronger, the number of functions required for the system to achieve is increasing and more complex, and a relatively independent and flexible business system and accounting system need to be built. Database servers are the preferred target for attackers and must be secured against internal, external, network, and application-level attacks. The integration architecture is focused on the collaborative integration of data, application, process, and interface of each application system in the enterprise, ensuring a complete technical carrier of integrated management and a perfect integration technology method.

"in tobacco industry mostly uses wired network communication and field operation mode, once people leave the office, they cannot get or submit the corresponding real-time information, causing delays in information and decision-making. Second, the real-time requirement of users, data incremental information is transmitted to the database in seconds. The objective factors of multiequipment and multi-information collection points in tobacco factories determine that there must be a large number of data records in the database. The system should ensure that a large amount of data is counted, and data analysis reports are generated within the valid time required by users. By using directory service, all information and resources on the network appear as an orderly and unified directory structure in front of network administrators, users, and applications. Databases usually contain the most sensitive and confidential data, such as personal details, customer details, orders, or credit card details of the human resources department. However, in practical application, the query access flow on the business side is very large, a single thread will make the system inefficient, and even the query will lose data. Therefore, how to perform multi-threaded parallel queries between the server and the client to process multiple requests has become the focus of research.

"multi-threaded parallel queries between the server and the client to process multiple requests has become the focus of research. In addition, you can further check the saturation and contribution of laboratory equipment. At the same time, the stability of physical index and chemical index of tobacco products can be obtained by analyzing each test index.5. ConclusionsWith the rapid development of data technology, data analysis and application are increasingly important in the daily operations of enterprises. A resource management statistical analysis system was established, including mobile comprehensive energy and water consumption statistical analysis module, mobile consumption proportion map module, and production and nonproduction hydropower map module. The implementation of the data acquisition system makes the information of the planning layer and the production automatic control layer of the tobacco production enterprise realize two-way circulation, and the status of the production activities can be displayed intuitively. It effectively promotes the management and scheduling of production by enterprises and provides a foundation for the realization of agile manufacturing in modern tobacco enterprises.

"overall design planning and principle introduction gradually start from the dimensions of technology use introduction, network, hardware, software architecture, design and implementation methods, and working principles. How to sort out the massive data generated in the R&D business and revitalize the data assets is a topic currently faced by the industry. Combining the advantages of centralized and noncentralized service discovery mechanisms provides effective service discovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity when individual peripherals join or exit in groups. The two are different in essence. Under the centralized mode, the unit combination and generation curve are determined based on the security constraints, which is a transaction mode closely related to the power grid operation and unified optimization of various transactions. The actual user queries entered by the business tier are broken down into subqueries for each data source, and the results of each subquery are returned to the business tier application in a unified view. Thus, data collection and unified view are achieved, which facilitates the development of upper telecommunication business.

"AbstractBackground and AimsBangladesh requires some pragmatic initiatives for using its immense potentiality to flourish health insurance. Introducing group health insurance for university students is a groundbreaking idea for stepping toward social health insurance in Bangladesh. This article examined the effect of the health insurance initiative for the university students introduced by the Institute of Health Economics, University of Dhaka, on attitude toward insurance and protecting financial risk against health care expenditure.MethodWe used both management information system (MIS) and primary data obtained through mixed methods. We collected the quantitative data from a baseline survey on 310 students and a year-end survey on 151 students. We used bivariate tools to analyze the data.ResultsThe results show that the mean score of attitude toward health insurance in the year-end survey (4.04) was significantly higher than the baseline score (3.21). Results also show that a significantly higher percentage of the students reported insurance as \"useful\" in the year-end survey (83.74%) than the baseline survey (40.40%). The results also reflectes that the scheme has a substantial impact on reducing the out-of-pocket spending for health care, especially for in-patient care, and the anxiety regarding the financing of health care among the students.

"the out-of-pocket spending for health care, especially for in-patient care, and the anxiety regarding the financing of health care among the students. There is also an indication of sustainability and the feasibility of scaling up such a scheme across the country.ConclusionsIntroducing such health insurance by all the universities may guide the nation toward large-scale group health insurance and social health insurance.1 INTRODUCTIONThis article outlines a brief evaluation of a pilot \"experiment\" that tries out the effectiveness and practicability of a health insurance scheme for a segment of the student population at the university level in Bangladesh. Although in advanced country settings, such programs are standard, similar systems do not exist in many developing countries. The introduction of this pilot experiment started while Bangladesh desperately explores alternative sources of health care financing to cope with fast increasing health care costs and reduce tremendously high out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for health care.The per capita health care expenditure in Bangladesh is USD 41.91, which is much lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended USD 88.1,2People need to pay about 74% of health outlays from OOP, which is the largest in the region than India with 63% and Sri Lanka with 51%.1Existing evidence shows that OOP payments for health care, especially for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), are a noticeable threat to the poverty reduction initiatives in"
"OOP, which is the largest in the region than India with 63% and Sri Lanka with 51%.1Existing evidence shows that OOP payments for health care, especially for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), are a noticeable threat to the poverty reduction initiatives in Bangladesh.3Massive dependency on OOP payments for health care increases households' financial burden. Significant and unpredictable OOP outlays for health care can expose the households to substantial financial risk and, at their most extreme, may result in impoverishment. Due to OOP payments for health care, about 5 million people fall under the poverty line in Bangladesh.4Therefore, health insurance is argued as an effective vehicle to make modern treatment facilities affordable to all socio-economic classes of people of Bangladesh. Despite colossal potentiality, the development of health insurance is negligible in Bangladesh.There is a debate whether Bangladesh should adopt a policy for social health insurance covering the entire population. The experts argue that the large informal sector (87.5%) and small tax-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio (8.97%), along with the lack of readiness of health care providers, do not allow introducing social health insurance in Bangladesh for the whole population at present.5However, as argued, Bangladesh should provide continuous efforts to create a pleasant environment to step toward social health insurance with gradual orientation with the informal sector backed by its dwindling"
"for the whole population at present.5However, as argued, Bangladesh should provide continuous efforts to create a pleasant environment to step toward social health insurance with gradual orientation with the informal sector backed by its dwindling nature and thus gain the economy's ability to contribute to the social health insurance fund.About 9.94 million people work in the formal sector.5Quite a negligible number (about 0.5 million) of formal sector employees are currently under some group health insurance (GHI) coverage by 4 general insurance companies and 15 life insurance companies. There is an enormous potentiality of flourishing GHI in the formal sector, including government, autonomous institutions, for-profit, and not-for-profit private organizations. There is also an opportunity to bring 4.2 million readymade garment workers under GHI coverage. Potentiality also exists for 150 million cell phone users.6The scope also prevails for about 1 million students studying at different public and private universities.7It is necessary to overcome the existing challenges the whole insurance sector faces, including negative attitude toward insurance, lack of insurance education, and absence of innovative insurance products to transform these scopes and opportunities into actions.8,9Negative attitude is the most profound one. Evidence from India and Ghana shows that insurance literacy and perception about insurance schemes play a crucial role in a household's decision to"
"to transform these scopes and opportunities into actions.8,9Negative attitude is the most profound one. Evidence from India and Ghana shows that insurance literacy and perception about insurance schemes play a crucial role in a household's decision to voluntarily enroll and remain enrolled in health insurance schemes.10,11As a demand-side factor, improving attitude toward health insurance requires a longer duration.Given this backdrop, at the beginning of 2018, the Institute of Health Economics (IHE), University of Dhaka, took a pioneering step in bringing its students under a GHI scheme, which is the first of its kind at any university in Bangladesh. This initiative emphasizes creating an opportunity for the students to realize that a health insurance mechanism is worthy and useful. This initiative is laudable for its novelty. The positive aspects are many; for one thing, the incidence of NCDs is expected to be much lower here than in the general population because of the age group. Therefore, it should be a low-cost event from the insurer's perspective.There is evidence that young adults have better health status, especially in terms of NCDs, compared to the general adult population. The incidence of acute illnesses and prevalence of chronic diseases is significantly lower among the younger population (age 20-29 years) compared to 30 years and above. The prevalence of co-morbidity is significantly lower among the population of 25-29 years (36.5 per 1000 population)"
"and prevalence of chronic diseases is significantly lower among the younger population (age 20-29 years) compared to 30 years and above. The prevalence of co-morbidity is significantly lower among the population of 25-29 years (36.5 per 1000 population) compared to the population of 30-34 years (54.5 per 1000 population) and above (more than 66 per 1000 population).12Therefore, health insurance for such an age group is expected to be more successful than those targeting a more diverse group of individuals.Moreover, health insurance for the students is likely to ensure access to health care and provide financial risk protection against health care expenditure. Therefore, this insurance scheme is expected to bear an immense potential for the students in reducing their fear that unforeseen heath incidents may jeopardize them physically and financially and thus could pose a challenge toward the completion of their academic degrees. This is especially true for those who come from households of modest means and those who relocate to the metropolis from regional towns and villages.Further, students can be seen and expected to serve as goodwill ambassadors for creating a positive attitude toward health insurance (assuming favorable experience with health care coverage while at university) among the public on the broader society. Hence, its successful scaling up and replication may be a route to stepping toward introducing social health insurance in the country. The existing studies"
"experience with health care coverage while at university) among the public on the broader society. Hence, its successful scaling up and replication may be a route to stepping toward introducing social health insurance in the country. The existing studies conducted mainly in the US context are limited to explore insurance literacy among the students. Low level of knowledge regarding health insurance and its association with utilization of health care are common findings in the literature.13-15However, there is a paucity of evidence, especially in developing counties, regarding the effectiveness of health insurance interventions on developing a positive attitude toward insurance among university students and their financial risk protection. Hence, the motivating factor of this research is to generate evidence on whether the health insurance scheme for university students plays an effective role in developing a positive attitude toward health insurance as well as financial risk protection.This study, using mix-methods along with management information system (MIS) data, attempts to examine the progress of the initiative in achieving its objectives: developing a positive attitude about insurance through materializing insurance benefits, protecting the financial risk of the students against health care expenditure, and countrywide scalability of the initiative.

"benefits, protecting the financial risk of the students against health care expenditure, and countrywide scalability of the initiative. This article is important in both academic and policy contexts as it evaluates a novel experiment of health insurance for university students. The findings are also crucial to improve the design of the scheme for scaling up and replication.The remaining part of the article is organized as follows. Section2provides a brief description of the insurance scheme. Section3describes the methodology. Section4illustrates the findings. Section5offers discussions and conclusions.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE INSURANCE SCHEMEUnder this unique initiative, IHE is the policyholder, and Pragati Life Insurance Limited (PLIL), the leading life insurance company in Bangladesh, is the insurer. This insurance scheme is compulsory in nature and yearly renewable where insurance coverage is active on the first day of enrollment. The eligible age group for the insurance is between 17 and 27 years at the time of enrollment, with having valid proof of student status. Altogether, 310 regular students of IHE are covered for health insurance (both inpatient and outpatient) and life insurance under this scheme. The annual premium per student is BDT 400 (USD 4.90), half of which is contributed by the student and the remaining half by the institute. The benefit package includes both inpatient department (IPD) care and outpatient department (OPD) care. All types of ailments apart"
"per student is BDT 400 (USD 4.90), half of which is contributed by the student and the remaining half by the institute. The benefit package includes both inpatient department (IPD) care and outpatient department (OPD) care. All types of ailments apart from mental, emotional, or psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, or any other narcotic addiction are covered under the scheme.Each student is reimbursed annually up to BDT 30000 (USD 367) for IPD care (maximum 10 days a rate of BDT 3000 [USD 37] per day), which includes room rent, hospital services, surgical expenses, consultation fees, diagnostic bills, and medicine during the hospitalization period. A claimant needs to submit treatment-related necessary articles such as a hospital discharge certificate, physician's prescriptions, diagnosis reports, and hospital bills.For OPD care, the annual reimbursable coverage is BDT 3000 (USD 37), which covers physician consultancy fees and medical investigations. Note that BDT 200 (USD 2.5) was fixed for a prescription as a doctor's consultation fee, and the diagnostic bill was the actual amount up to the maximum limit. However, the reimbursable amount was revised to BDT 5000 after the first year. Moreover, the students can enjoy a 25% discount on pathological and imaging services in more than 200 impaneled hospitals across the country. In addition, if any student dies for any cases except suicide or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), his or her"
"on pathological and imaging services in more than 200 impaneled hospitals across the country. In addition, if any student dies for any cases except suicide or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), his or her family gets BDT 50000 (USD 612.22) from the insurance company.The benefit ceiling was determined upon consultation with the students, while the premium rate was determined based on the competitive bidding. The claimants submit their claims to the IHE desk officer assigned for facilitating the insurance initiative. A designated official of the insurance company collects the claims from IHE once/twice a week and reimburses the claims as per the policy document through the mobile banking system.3 METHODSThe data analyzed in the article were obtained from a baseline survey, a year-end survey, MIS of both policyholder (ie, IHE) and insurer (ie, PLIL), and a daily diary of the activities. The baseline survey was conducted on all the 310 students of IHE in January 2018. All the under-graduate (first year-fourth year) and Master's students of this entity were attempted to interview in the baseline survey. The year-end survey was conducted during February and March 2019, while we also attempted to interview all the students of IHE who participated in the baseline survey apart from those who passed out.

"attempted to interview all the students of IHE who participated in the baseline survey apart from those who passed out. It is worth mentioning that, in the university, there was a prolonged student movement for \"reforming quota system\" in the government recruitment policy while the year-end survey was conducted. Many students boycotted the class for a long time as part of their movement, and hence it was not possible to interview the students who were absent in the class while conducting the year-end survey. Therefore, a total of 151 students were interviewed in the year-end survey. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 12 students, of which 7 were insurance benefit claimants.In addition to a claim form, a prescribed form was required to fill up by the students while submitting an insurance claim at IHE. Thus, data like type of claim (OPD or IPD), amount of claim, amount of medical expenditure by different heads (eg, consultation fees, diagnostic charges, medicine costs, operation costs, bed/cabin charges), and the background information of the claimants were stored at IHE. We also provided a prescribed format to the insurance company to maintain the MIS data. The insurance company provided information like the type of claim and amount of reimbursement.

"like the type of claim and amount of reimbursement. Moreover, we noted down the daily activities and experiences in a diary regularly.We administered a semi-structured questionnaire in both the baseline as well as the year-end survey. After incorporating the feedbacks of the pretesting, we finalized the questionnaire. The baseline survey elicited socio-demographic attributes, disease profile, health care-seeking behavior, and attitude about health insurance. The year-end survey also elicited information like increasing access to health care, financial risk protection, reduction of anxiety, attitude toward continuing the scheme by IHE, introducing such scheme in other departments and institutes of the university, and willingness to join such scheme after entering the career.The study received ethical clearance from the institutional review board (IRB) of IHE. Informed consent was sought prior to taking part in the interview. We used bivariate tools for data analysis.4 RESULTSIn the baseline survey, a total of 310 (male = 185 and female = 125) students were successfully interviewed. About 45.7% of the students were residing in residential halls of the university. A similar portion (45.8%) were residing with their family. The remaining students were residing in student messes or with their relatives. In the year-end survey, 151 students were interviewed, of which 58% were male, and 42% were female.

"remaining students were residing in student messes or with their relatives. In the year-end survey, 151 students were interviewed, of which 58% were male, and 42% were female. About 49% of the students were residing in residential halls and 42% with their family. The age of the students in both baseline and year-end surveys ranged from 19 to 25 years. The average monthly household income of the students was about BDT 52000 (USD 636.71) in the baseline survey, while it was about BDT 63500 (USD 777) in the year-end survey. About 24% and 28% of the students had their earnings, mainly from private tuition, resulting from baseline and year-end survey, respectively. Their average monthly earnings were found as BDT 5466 (USD 67) and 7988 (USD 98) in the baseline survey and year-end survey, respectively (Table not shown).The MIS data of the insurance company show that over 1 year, there were 91 claims by 62 students, of which 87 were OPD and 4 were IPD. More than a quarter of the students (28.61%) submitted OPD claims, while 1.3% submitted IPD claims (Table not shown). The claim rate was significantly (P-value <.01) higher (37.5%) among the male students compared to the female students (18.33%).4.1 Attitude toward insuranceWe asked the students in the baseline survey to rate their attitude toward insurance in a five-point scale (5 = very useful, 4 = useful, 3 = fair, 2 = not useful and 1 = harmful).

"the students in the baseline survey to rate their attitude toward insurance in a five-point scale (5 = very useful, 4 = useful, 3 = fair, 2 = not useful and 1 = harmful). However, in the year-end survey, we added an additional option named as \"no idea about health insurance.\" As seen in Table1, the mean score of the year-end survey (4.04) is significantly higher (P-value <.01) compared to the baseline score (3.21). Due to a small number of observations, we classified the responses into three categories (useful, fair, and not useful) by merging \"very useful\" with \"useful\" and \"harmful\" with \"not useful.\" The results show that insurance was reported as \"useful\" by a significantly (P-value <.01) higher percentage of the students in the year-end survey (80.13%) than the baseline one (45.40%). On the contrary, the percentage of students reporting \"fair\" was significantly lower (P-value <.05) in the year-end survey compared to the baseline survey. Interestingly, no student was found responding to \"not useful\" option in the year-end survey although it was responded by 17% of the students in the baseline survey.TABLE  1.Attitude of the university students toward insuranceAttitude toward insuranceBaseline survey (N1= 310)Year-end survey (N2= 151)% (n)% (n)Useful45.40 (141)80.13 (121)Fair37.42 (116)15.23 (23)Not useful17.17 (53)0.00 (0)No idea about health insurance-4.64 (7)Mean score (in a 5-point scale)3.21 (SD = 1.12)4.04 (SD = 0.72)The difference in mean score between the baseline"

It is seen that the percentage of students who rated GHI as \"useful\" was significantly (P-value <.01) higher among the claimants than the nonclaimants of insurance benefit (Table2). This implies that materialization of the health insurance benefit, as hypothesized, leads to grow more positive attitude toward health insurance among the insured.TABLE  2.Attitude toward group health insurance of the claimants and the nonclaimantsIndicatorsThe nonclaimants % (n)The claimants % (n)Useful77.95 (99)91.67 (22)Fair16.54 (21)8.33 (2)Not useful0.00 (0)0.00 (0)No idea about health insurance5.51 (7)0.00 (0)Total100.00 (127)100.00 (24)Similar findings were also derived from qualitative analyses.

"about the scheme. All the respondents of IDIs acknowledged insurance as a useful tool, although half of them had a negative attitude about health insurance before enrolling in the scheme. One of the respondents mentioned,\"Although I have not claimed any benefit yet, I think that health insurance is a novel idea. Because today I am protecting my friends; tomorrow my friends will protect me from the burden of health care expenditure.\"Another student mentioned,\"I have a severe cold allergy. Due to having health insurance coverage, I am not facing financial hardship for seeking health care. However, I am worried about the expiration of this health insurance coverage in the next year after completing my Master's degree. Hence, health insurance should be made compulsory for all the people in the country.\"4.2 Accessibility and financial risk protectionWe asked the students who claimed insurance benefits in the year-end survey regarding the ease of access to health services and financial risk protection due to enrolment in the GHI scheme. It is seen that 41.67% of the claimants reported that GHI's enrollment made access to health services absolutely easier. The remaining 58.33% also reported that GHI made access to health services moderately easier (Table3).TABLE  3.Impact of group health insurance on making easy access to health services and mitigating health care expenditure of the claimants who participated in the year-end surveyIndicatorsAccess to health services % (n)Mitigating"

We also asked the claimants whether enrolment in GHI reduced the anxiety of mitigating the spending for health care. About 29% of the claimants reported that enrolment in GHI absolutely reduced their anxiety of mitigating the spending for health care, while the remaining 71% reported a moderate reduction of their anxiety for mitigating the health care spending (Table not shown).Tables4and5were constituted based on the MIS data of the insurance company and data stored at the IHE office. The results show that the GHI scheme provided 57.57% financial risk protection of consultation and diagnostic services, which stood 33.61% if medicine and day-case were included in the outpatient benefit package. In other words, the copayment for consultation and diagnostic services covered under the scheme constituted 42.43% of OPD expenses, while it became 66.39% after including the expenses for medicines and day cases.

About 57% of the claims had more than 70% financial risk protection of the existing benefit package, which declined to 27% while adding medicine in the benefit package (Table5). This calls for revising the OPD benefit package while scaling up and replicating in the future since the copayment should not exceed 25% of total health expenses.16The benefit ceiling needs to be almost doubled for giving 75% financial risk protection to the insured. Although the scheme provides very high financial risk protection (96.16%) for IPD services, there is also importance of increasing the benefit ceiling while scaling up for all the students at the University of Dhaka. This is because there may arise more severe and expensive IPD cases, especially for critical illness, while a large number of students will be included in the scheme.Qualitative analyses also show similar results. The respondents were asked about the beneficial aspect of the scheme. Health insurance was reported as a very useful mechanism for financial risk protection by all the respondents of the IDIs. One of the respondents had the following comment,\"I became sick a few months ago, but I was hesitant to seek treatment due to not having enough money. Suddenly, one of my"

One of the respondents had the following comment,\"I became sick a few months ago, but I was hesitant to seek treatment due to not having enough money. Suddenly, one of my classmates reminded me about the health insurance benefit. Then, I decided to seek treatment using the money which I kept for paying accommodation fees. After my recovery, I received reimbursement of the claimed amount and paid my accommodation fees.\"Another student quoted,\"My best friend was mentally upset due to suffering from dengue fever. He had to incur high medical costs. However, reimbursement from health insurance helped him to overcome his mental stress. I have a realization, from this incident that health insurance saves us from sudden financial loss, which relieves us from anxieties.\"4.3 Scope of scalability and sustainabilityThe students were asked to know their views on whether the GHI scheme should be continued. All the students who took part in the survey strongly urged for continuing the GHI scheme. They also reported that the scheme should be placed in other institutes and departments of the university. An overwhelming majority also intended to avail GHI benefit after entering into the career (Table6).TABLE  6.Views regarding the continuation of group health insurance (GHI), placing it for the students of other entities of the university, and intention to avail GHI benefit after entering into the"

The staff of IHE are also interested in being enrolled in such a health insurance scheme, although they had a strong negative attitude initially.The MIS data of the insurance company show that it reimbursed BDT 100225 (USD 1227) against the premium of BDT 121, 600 (USD 1488). In other words, the total reimbursement was 82.42% of the revenue from the premium. More precisely, the insurer had a 17.58% surplus in the premium revenue for its loading costs (administrative expenses and profit margin), which is significantly lower compared to the existing scenario (53%) in Bangladesh.17The loading costs range from 6.3% to 32% in most of middle- and low-income countries.17Hence, the loading costs seem to be very high in Bangladesh.

"which is significantly lower compared to the existing scenario (53%) in Bangladesh.17The loading costs range from 6.3% to 32% in most of middle- and low-income countries.17Hence, the loading costs seem to be very high in Bangladesh. This implies that the sustainability of the scheme is constrained by scaling up through the enrollment of more students.The respondents of the IDI were asked to get their views on whether the scheme should be scaled up to all the universities in Bangladesh. A good number of respondents commented on health insurance as a crucial financing alternative for health care, and hence, they suggested for its countrywide scale-up. They added, the university administration should take initiatives to bring all the students under the health insurance mechanism. They also expressed their vows for calling a human chain/rally in the campus, if needed, to push the university administration. A number of them were willing to include their family members and relatives in such a health insurance mechanism. They were also interested in including themselves in health insurance mechanisms in their working life.One respondent quoted,\"I like the idea of health insurance so much. I would recommend introducing health insurance in my future workplace wherever I work. When I would become the head of my organization, I will introduce health insurance for all the staff in my office.\"Another respondent mentioned,\"I live in the university dormitory.

"in my future workplace wherever I work. When I would become the head of my organization, I will introduce health insurance for all the staff in my office.\"Another respondent mentioned,\"I live in the university dormitory. My whole family lives in a village. A few days ago, my younger sister was infected with typhoid. It was difficult for my schoolteacher father to bear the medical expenses. It would have been better if my sister also had insurance coverage like me. Thus, my opinion is that health insurance should be introduced at all levels in our country.\"After the insurance initiative rolling out, IHE adopted various measures, including sensitization through banner, festoon, leaflet, organizing seminar, questions and answers sessions, classroom briefing, and setting a health insurance corner for responding to day-to-day questions raised by the students.IHE took various initiatives, including sending letters to other entities of the University of Dhaka to introduce a similar scheme for their students. As a result, some departments of the University of Dhaka, such as Economics, History, Development Studies, Sanskrit, Anthropology, and Criminology, have already brought their students under the scheme. The central administration (Deans' Committee) of the university took a groundbreaking decision on June 2, 2020, to introduce health insurance for about 37018 students.18A technical committee was formed later on to design the benefits package and formulate the modus operandi.

"(Deans' Committee) of the university took a groundbreaking decision on June 2, 2020, to introduce health insurance for about 37018 students.18A technical committee was formed later on to design the benefits package and formulate the modus operandi. The initiative is now under the process of selecting an insurance company through competitive bidding.The institute also issued a letter to all public universities with a copy to the University Grant Commission and other organizations, including Access to Information (a2i), Planning Commission, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and Economic Relations Division, describing the health insurance scheme and its benefits in brief. It is, thus, expected that other universities may adopt similar decision like the University of Dhaka for introducing health insurance for their students in the near future.5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONSBangladesh, currently in a transitional stage for graduating to a developing country, is expecting to become a developed country by 2041. Insurance coverage is a key parameter, among others, for a country to be considered as a developed one. Evidence shows that insurance development enhances economic growth.19,20There is an ample contribution of the insurance sector to GDP in most of the developed countries. The contribution of insurance to GDP in 2016 was 9.21% in the United Kingdom, 11.28% in the United States, 7.37% in Sweden, 11.02% in France, 7.97% in Italy, 17.6% in Hong Kong, 12.48% in Korea, 7.7% in"

The contribution of insurance to GDP in 2016 was 9.21% in the United Kingdom, 11.28% in the United States, 7.37% in Sweden, 11.02% in France, 7.97% in Italy, 17.6% in Hong Kong, 12.48% in Korea, 7.7% in Japan, and 4.97% in Australia.21The contribution of insurance to GDP is also quite promising in some south Asian countries, such as Maldives and India, which respectively were 4.7% and 3.07% in 2016. The contribution of the insurance sector to GDP in Bangladesh is only 0.9%, of which 0.7% by life insurance and the rest 0.2% by nonlife insurance or general insurance.GHI has not been flourished, despite its enormous scope, due to various factors, including massive negative attitudes toward insurance. Traditional insurance promotion is not effective in addressing such a deep-rooted demand-side problem. IHE, thus, came forward to introduce a GHI scheme for the university students aiming at their financial risk protection from treatment expenses and making the students as insurance advocate via developing a positive attitude toward insurance through providing practical experience of the benefits of health insurance. Introducing health insurance for university students, thus, is one step forward in promoting insurance education as well as developing insurance in Bangladesh.The university students, the most advanced part of the youth population and immediate future of the nation, are highly diversified in terms of the economic,"
"is one step forward in promoting insurance education as well as developing insurance in Bangladesh.The university students, the most advanced part of the youth population and immediate future of the nation, are highly diversified in terms of the economic, religious, and regional contexts of Bangladesh. The majority of the students, especially in public universities, come from middle and lower-middle-class families. Thus, it is imperative to address financial risk protection with health insurance as an acceptable method across society by reducing the knowledge gap and transforming the positive outlook.For mobilizing health insurance, it is necessary to disseminate practical knowledge of insurance among the people who are in the mainstream, especially university students who have more influence in their respective communities than any other groups. It is obvious that if the students can realize the benefits of health insurance, they may serve as the insurance promoters and play an important role in scaling up the health insurance mechanism in a higher dimension in their professional life.There is a clear indication from both quantitative and qualitative findings that the GHI scheme initiated by IHE has been able to increase positive attitudes toward insurance mechanisms among university students. There is also a clear sign of making access to health services easier and mitigating the burden of spending for health care. This is helpful for reducing the anxiety regarding the"
"positive attitudes toward insurance mechanisms among university students. There is also a clear sign of making access to health services easier and mitigating the burden of spending for health care. This is helpful for reducing the anxiety regarding the financing of health care. The scheme is especially useful to provide financial risk protection for IPD care. Similar evidence is found in the literature, especially on social health insurance.10,22,23There is also a strong sign of scaling up of the scheme, which may also lead to making it sustainable.Hence, introducing health insurance for university students seems to be an important step toward enhancing financial risk protection and reducing the negative attitude toward insurance. Inspirations by the government to all the universities for introducing such health insurance for their students may guide the nation to move toward large-scale group health insurance and eventually social health insurance in the near future.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors would like to thank the Institute of Health Economics (IHE), University of Dhaka, and Universal Research Care Ltd. for this collaborative research effort.

"AbstractIn order to improve the effect of intelligent development of tourism resources, this paper combines the Internet of Things technology and 5G technology to carry out intelligent development of tourism resources to improve the recommendation effect of modern tourism resources. Meanwhile, this paper analyzes the basic knowledge of array signal DOA estimation to get the definition of narrowband signal. Simultaneously, this paper proposes a subspace-based DOA estimation algorithm based on the actual needs of tourism resource management, and uses the observed array data to construct a covariance matrix. Then, this paper decomposes the covariance matrix, and then performs DOA estimation. In addition, this paper constructs an intelligent development system of tourism resources based on the Internet of Things and 5G technology. It can be seen from the experimental research that the intelligent development system of tourism resources based on the Internet of Things and 5G technology proposed in this paper has good tourism resource management and development effects.1. IntroductionToday, the pursuit of individuality and self-expression has become fashionable, and tourism is no exception. At present, quite a lot of tourists, especially the young and middle-aged as the most important part of the tourism market, are no longer satisfied with the way of group travel but are inclined to \"self-service travel\". They hope to choose the travel destination they are most interested in"
