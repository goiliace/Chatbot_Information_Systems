"AbstractIn some remote areas and even some vocational colleges, the information management of students is still stagnant on paper. Such traditional methods have obviously lagged behind the development and needs of society. The traditional manual management is a waste of both manpower and material resources. In today's rapidly developing information age, it is very necessary to study an efficient vocational education management system. The vocational education management system designed in this paper includes Web server, DB server, college management terminal, and load balancing switch. In this system, CONN.ASP is a common module of all ASP programs in the whole system. It is mainly used to realize the connection between ASP program and database and the calling of common function submodules. In order to reduce the power consumption of the vocational education management system, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) theory is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can effectively save the size of the storage unit and the number and frequency of reading the twiddle factor, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the operation speed. This paper randomly selected the scores of 10 classes and use the system for data processing test.

"test. A total of 50% of teachers were particularly satisfied with the tables generated by the discrete Fourier transform-based vocational education management system. They believed that the vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform is very fast in data processing, and the processing speed was within 0.1 s. The system designed in this paper can meet various demands in vocational education management and continuously enhance the function of educational administration management.1. IntroductionEducation is an important way for a nation to thrive and an important basis for realizing the Chinese dream. With the continuous expansion and deepening of educational resources, vocational education, as a beneficial supplement to higher education, has received extensive attention. Vocational education is gradually accepted by students, parents, and employers because of its advantages of strong professionalism, strong pertinence, and wide application. The core management idea of the vocational education management system is to realize the effective management of vocational education, including the management of educational resources, information release, and information presentation and other functions. With the help of computer network technology and information technology, it is of great significance to develop vocational education management system and improve management flexibility and management efficiency.Vocational education schools urgently need a"
"the help of computer network technology and information technology, it is of great significance to develop vocational education management system and improve management flexibility and management efficiency.Vocational education schools urgently need a scientific management model and a modern management carrier, so the research and development of the vocational education management system is very necessary. Golsteyn and Stenberg studied individual enrollment data based on short-term (2-year) high school courses in Sweden, exploring for the first time an individual's earnings over an almost complete career [1]. Anderson presented the findings of a review of the policy and research literature, focusing on the following: the Australian vocational education and training (VET) market and the development of the policy framework and administrative infrastructure of the Australian training market since its inception [2]. Verhaest et al. found a similar contrast effect in terms of education and skills mismatch [3]. Oviawe et al. examined best practices in TVET school-workplace collaboration: bridging the skills gap to meet workforce demands in the twenty-first century workplace [4]. Di Stasio and Valentina believed that because of the popularity of the VET system in different countries, the degree of participation of social partners in providing training and vocational skills certification are different [5].

"popularity of the VET system in different countries, the degree of participation of social partners in providing training and vocational skills certification are different [5]. The efficiency of the vocational education management system they proposed is very slow. Therefore, this paper will optimize the vocational education management system by means of discrete Fourier transform.The discrete Fourier transform can improve the memory read efficiency. Okada and Umeno studied the problems in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) test contained in SP 800-22 published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [6]. Abbas et al. has developed accurate algorithms in two and three dimensions that involve only one-dimensional equidistant fast Fourier transforms without interpolation or approximation at any stage [7]. Savchenko and Savchenko considered the problem of autoregressive modeling of speech signals from their discrete Fourier transform data over a speech frame (several milliseconds) interval [8]. Freitas and Morgado-Dias focused on the theoretical derivation of correlated multisampling techniques via discrete Fourier transforms, which explicitly include noise contamination processes during image sensor readout operations [9].

"readout operations [9]. Chechetkin and Lobzin developed a discrete double Fourier transform (DDFT) algorithm [10]. The discrete Fourier transform they proposed is quite detrimental for sustainability in practical engineering.In recent years, with the continuous expansion of the enrollment scale, coupled with the large mobility of teachers and the complex student structure, the management difficulty is increasing and the management efficiency is low. In order to improve management efficiency, it is urgent to standardize management with the help of modern means and scientific management methods. This paper designs and implements a management information system suitable for vocational education. The system is based on Browser/Server architecture and provides a unified platform for college information release. It provides system support for teachers and students management and provides a support platform for teachers and students to communicate after class. Using discrete Fourier transform we can mine user operation habits, preferred content, and access frequency information from user operation history, so as to guide system content organization and access management, and significantly improve system resource utilization. It can meet the needs of the largest users with the smallest content resources, thereby saving education and teaching resources.

"meet the needs of the largest users with the smallest content resources, thereby saving education and teaching resources. The proportion of external teachers accounted for 21%, and the teachers hired included both those who taught cultural courses and a small number of enterprise technical personnel.2. Design and Realization of Vocational Education Management System2.1. Vocational EducationIn the era of knowledge economy, it is impossible to fully and effectively participate in the education competition only by the decision-making of one's own department leaders. Therefore, it is necessary to bring all relevant parties in the education process such as colleges, teachers, students, parents, and employers into a close relationship. According to the accumulated data, such as the source of students, enrollment grades, gender, age, academic performance, job destination and parental evaluation, data mining and extraction are carried out based on the method and process of knowledge discovery. In this way, representative decision support data can be formed and the necessary basis for policy designation can be provided.Using discrete Fourier transform, the operating habits of operators can be captured, and data prefetching is performed for the current user in the background, thereby improving the efficiency of data access and user access. With the increasing employment pressure, vocational education is no longer limited to postvocational education. It contains the sum of preservice"
"for the current user in the background, thereby improving the efficiency of data access and user access. With the increasing employment pressure, vocational education is no longer limited to postvocational education. It contains the sum of preservice education and postservice education of various educational forms, which are a comprehensive education facing the market economy and global market, changing with the changes of social forces. It takes different forms in different parts of the world as the needs of the global market change. Universities and colleges around the world are gradually adapting to this change, striving to respond quickly to the current needs of different groups and their demands to continue their studies. With the increasing progress of science and technology, people are more and more aware of the great significance of vocational education.When the sampling frequency is fixed, the accuracy of the DFT depends on the frequency variation of the management system. In DFT, the frequency resolution △fDFT is a gate, which refers to the minimum distance that can be resolved in the spectrum. Its calculation formula is as follows[11]:(1)In formula (1),Nis the number of student information sampling points [12].In the management of higher vocational education, the primary problem of the local government as the main body of management is to clarify its own scope of authority.

"the management of higher vocational education, the primary problem of the local government as the main body of management is to clarify its own scope of authority. In the process of talent cultivation, society and the market are in a dominant position, while local governments and relevant departments of higher vocational education play a more role in serving and cooperating. With the continuous development of the economy and society and the intensification of competition, the local government has gradually transformed from an outsider to a coordinator. The formulation of relevant laws on vocational education by the state confirms the legal status of vocational education from the legal level, providing legal guarantee for the development of vocational education. The policies, regulations, and rules formulated by local governments according to national laws and the actual situation of local development provide a strong impetus for the construction of higher vocational education, making the construction of higher vocational education more targeted and in line with local development requirements. At the same time, the construction of the management system of higher vocational education by the local government also ensures the standardization and sustainability of the development of higher vocational education.2.2.

"standardization and sustainability of the development of higher vocational education.2.2. User Requirements and Functions of Vocational Education Management SystemThrough the research of users, the user needs are formed. The user needs mainly include two aspects, namely external functions and internal functions. External functions are functions that users expect the system to provide to external users, and internal functions are functions that users need to provide for system maintenance.(i)External function(1)Information release function: The information release function is to centrally manage some of the information on the web page that needs to be changed, including news, other articles, new policies, and real-time dynamics and other information that needs to be updated. The data are classified by some common problems, and finally systematized and standardized, and published on the college website.(2)In-site information retrieval function: The in-site information retrieval function runs through the entire website, which can facilitate users to find the information they are interested in more quickly. It will be convenient for information viewers of the website to operate according to their preferred search forms (such as column, title, content, classification, date), allowing users to find the resources they are interested in in the fastest way in the huge database.

"as column, title, content, classification, date), allowing users to find the resources they are interested in in the fastest way in the huge database. It is necessary to provide a convenient and efficient query function in the website. The query can be carried out according to categories, keywords, etc. The full-text content retrieval can also be carried out based on the full-text content. It supports complex combination retrieval methods for arbitrary keywords. It needs to support Chinese and English mixed retrieval methods and support intelligent fuzzy retrieval methods. Fuzzy search means that the system makes more searches based on the words entered by the user. In order to meet the needs of different information websites, the system developer provides a portal search based on web content and provides a way to classify and retrieve information in the site based on its own website content.(ii)Internal functions(1)Confirmation function: The teaching situation, feedback, and spot checks of the college are monitored every month or within a fixed period of time, and is submitted to the management department for confirmation.(2)Alarming function: The administrator is alerted when facing one of the following situations. The grades (pass rate and excellent rate) of a certain course are not within the upper and lower limits set in advance for the course. In a certain course, the teacher is late, leaving early, or changing the class location, which is not in accordance with the"
"grades (pass rate and excellent rate) of a certain course are not within the upper and lower limits set in advance for the course. In a certain course, the teacher is late, leaving early, or changing the class location, which is not in accordance with the school management regulations. A course is about to end or to enter the examination period, prompting teachers to enter grades within a specified time period, etc.(3)Intelligent function: It adopts the basic theory of knowledge discovery, monitors the data in the system, and submits it to the user for confirmation in time. For example, there are no students taking electives in a certain course for a long time. The test scores of a certain course have changed abnormally. The feedback information of college teachers and students is abnormal, etc.The frequency resolution of the DFT method is often fixed and cannot be adjusted with the fundamental frequency. In addition, due to insufficient frequency resolution, when the signal contains interharmonics, the fence effect will also cause calculation errors. The fence effect is to sample a function, that is, to extract the corresponding function value on the sampling point. The calculation formula of the mean square error of the processing efficiency of the vocational education management system is as formula [13]:(2)The calculation formula of energy consumption of vocational education management system is as formula [14]:(3)(iii)External structureIn the system analysis of this"

The functions include information release function, information management function, in-site information retrieval function, user registration management function, information feedback function, online polling function, confirmation function, intelligent function, and backup function. Vocational education college management system is mainly for four types of users, namely students, teachers, administrators, students' parents, and other access users. These users can be divided into four categories according to their access content and characteristics, namely Guest, Teacher, Administrator, and Superuser.Guest users mainly include students, students' parents, and other personnel. Such users can only access the data disclosed by the system, but cannot access the background data of the system.Teacher users are mainly colleges and teachers related to college courses. Such users can access both public data and data related to their own courses.Administrator users are mainly college administrator users.

Such users can see all the data in the system and can modify some authorized data.Superuser users are mainly system maintainers and college administrators, and these users are given access and modification rights to all data.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem function and user structure.2.3. System ImplementationThe school campus network provides dedicated access routes for vocational and technical colleges and the vocational education management system includes Web servers, DB servers, college management terminals and load-balancing switches. The router not only provides docking services with schools but also provides docking services with government agencies, including users of state organs, city and county counterpart management departments, external networks and parents. It also provides access services for students. The intelligent function module mainly uses the knowledge discovery method to organize, extract, and configure the data information in the system, such as system data storage optimization, user system operation records, user operation data analysis statistics, and other knowledge discovery operations.The functional structure of the course management subsystem is shown in Figure2.

It is divided into five parts: teacher information management, course management, course search, course application management, and safe withdrawal. Teacher information management includes basic information modification, password modification, user registration, and user login.

Course searches include quick search, advanced search, category search, course favorites, and course browse.

The student grade list describes the examinations of a course in the past semester, including course number, name, and number of people. The class schedule list includes class number, name, class date, number of teaching weeks, number of electives, class location, class time, and status flags. The data analysis checklist includes the content number, name, data results, and auxiliary suggestions.After the administrator has successfully logged in, the administrator can enter three subsystems for the next step, namely the website content maintenance subsystem, the website data maintenance subsystem, and the user and authority management subsystem. After entering the website content maintenance subsystem, the legality and timeliness of the website information are checked, and the expired website content is deleted. After entering the website data maintenance subsystem, file data, course data, and user data are maintained in the background. After entering the user and authority management subsystem, operations such as adding, modifying, and deleting users are completed, and user authority is set for each user. After the operation is completed, the administrator can choose to return to the home page or exit the maintenance.In the process of developing vocational education management information system, because each functional"
"user authority is set for each user. After the operation is completed, the administrator can choose to return to the home page or exit the maintenance.In the process of developing vocational education management information system, because each functional module is realized by a relatively independent ASP program. Each ASP program must connect to the database before accessing the database, and each functional module has many similar functions in the implementation process. For example, the same submodule function needs to be called when fetching data from the database and sending the data to the HTML page. This will lead to a large amount of program code repetition in places with similar functions, which wastes system resources, thereby reducing the development efficiency and maintainability of the system. Therefore, in the process of developing the vocational education management information system, this paper adopts the modular program development method. That is, the parts with similar functions are separately proposed and designed into common modules, such as database connection, and calling of the same function submodule. This greatly reduces the code amount of the program, thereby improving the development efficiency and maintainability of the entire system. In this system, CONN.ASP (the statement and configuration to connect to the database) is a common module of all ASP programs in the whole system.

In the functional testing phase, the testers randomly extract the user names and passwords of the administrator and client in the database. The system is tested for correctness and error one by one. The user login command is submitted to the system login platform. The user login interface should correctly display the feedback information of success or failure [15].2.5. Discrete Fourier TransformThe discrete Fourier transform approximates the sampled signal by a finite set (the set equivalent to a line segment of a string of natural numbers, and the empty set) of exponential functions whose frequency, amplitude, and phase angle are unknown. First, two invariant central moment sets are defined, and their weighted averages are calculated, respectively, as feature quantities. The template is extracted from the original student data"
"whose frequency, amplitude, and phase angle are unknown. First, two invariant central moment sets are defined, and their weighted averages are calculated, respectively, as feature quantities. The template is extracted from the original student data through the mapping function and added to the original vocational education system data after multiplying the scaling coefficient, so that the feature quantity reaches a certain predetermined value. Due to the geometric invariance feature of this feature quantity, it can resist common geometric attacks. DFT not only ensures the read-only memory (ROM) with less twiddle factor but also reduces the number of readings when extracting the information of the vocational education management system, realizing the unity of speed and reduction of system power consumption.The Fourier transform of the two-dimensional discrete functionf(x,y) of the vocational education management system is as formula [16]:(4)The spectrum and phase spectrum of the discrete two-dimensional Fourier transform of the vocational education management system are as follows [17]:(5)(6)Due to the effect of spectrum leakage, the result obtained by DFT is often only an approximation of the real spectrum of the signal. The error comes from the spectral leakage caused by windowing and truncation and the numerical error of asynchronous sampling. This is because in reality, signal analysis must truncate a section of limited length. As long as there is truncation, it will"
"The error comes from the spectral leakage caused by windowing and truncation and the numerical error of asynchronous sampling. This is because in reality, signal analysis must truncate a section of limited length. As long as there is truncation, it will inevitably bring about spectrum leakage. The ultimate purpose of windowing is amplitude modulation. Compared with some other window functions and rectangular windows, in the time domain, the amplitude of the acquired educational information tends to zero at the beginning and end of sampling to make it smooth. In the frequency domain, these window functions have wider main lobes and lower side lobes, which means that the energy of the vocational education management system is more concentrated near the midline in the frequency domain. The energy loss of vocational education management system is suppressed [18].3. System Experiment Results and AnalysisA total of 36% of full-time teachers have obtained national vocational qualification certificates, of which 24% are teachers above senior level. The situation of vocational school teachers obtaining national vocational qualification certificates is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointVocational school teachers' acquisition of national vocational qualification certificates.Vocational school teacher source structure statistics have different opinions on the standard of \"double-qualified\" teachers.

"acquisition of national vocational qualification certificates.Vocational school teacher source structure statistics have different opinions on the standard of \"double-qualified\" teachers. This paper adopts the \"three types of dual-qualified\" teacher division method widely used in the academic circles. The dual-qualified teachers type refers to talents with high literacy and high level. The survey showed that \"dual-qualified teacher type\" accounted for 38% and 56% of full-time teachers and professional teachers, respectively, the proportion of which was relatively low. Among them, the proportion of the first type of \"dual-qualified\" teachers was relatively high, accounting for 25% and 392% of full-time teachers and professional teachers, respectively. The distribution of \"dual-qualified\" teachers was also unbalanced. Technical schools were much higher than schools sponsored by the education department. Urban schools were higher than county and city schools, and public schools were higher than private schools [19,20]. The proportion of dual-qualified teachers is shown in Table1.Table  1.Proportion of dual-qualified teachers.Dual-qualified teacher typeProportion of dual-qualified teachers (%)Proportion of full-time teachers (%)Proportion of teachers in professional courses (%)Class I dual-qualified teachers652532Class II dual-qualified teachers25612Class III dual-qualified teachers10712Total1003856Flexible and diverse introduction mechanisms enhance the vitality of the teaching"

Vocational schools have many majors and are updated quickly. According to the needs of the post, the school selects teachers through a variety of methods. The first is to strengthen ties with colleges and universities and go directly to colleges to recruit outstanding graduates. The second is to strengthen school-enterprise cooperation. The preliminary establishment of the school-based training mechanism promotes the improvement of the level of teachers. Many schools have formulated long-term plans for school teacher training, clarified the tasks and goals of school teacher training, and implemented the famous teacher project. Most schools combine the implementation of the teacher appointment system and constantly improve the structural salary system to mobilize the enthusiasm of teachers. A solid funding guarantee mechanism has been established to train teachers in multiple ways. At present, the main forms of school-based training in schools are as follows: implementing the project of \"teachers going to the factory\" and sending professional teachers to the factory for training.

"of \"teachers going to the factory\" and sending professional teachers to the factory for training. The school adopts the forms of \"one helps another\" and \"teacher and apprentice\" to accelerate the growth of young teachers. Teachers can be promoted by race, that is, by organizing and participating in teaching and research activities such as municipal, provincial, and national professional skills competitions, teaching competitions, the overall level of the team can be improved. Faculty and staff are encouraged to achieve academic qualifications through self-study.The teaching system is not perfect. The flow of teachers can only be carried out within a relatively regional range, and the space is very limited. Some schools still mainly supplement cultural teachers. The time for teachers to practice exercise cannot be guaranteed. On the one hand, teachers in vocational schools pay attention to the experience of professional practice and emphasize the close combination of verbal and hands-on ability. Opportunities for teacher training are uneven. Due to the differences in the majors offered by various schools, there are many major categories and higher training costs, resulting in many training opportunities for some majors, but basically no for a few majors.Among them, the proportion of external teachers accounted for 21%.

The hired teachers include both cultural and professional teachers, as well as a small number of enterprise technical personnel (The proportion of external teachers is shown in Figure4(a)). At present, the proportion of teachers in cultural courses in secondary and higher vocational colleges is relatively high, accounting for 42% of the total number of full-time teachers, and the proportion of practical instructors is only 13% (The proportion of teachers by type is shown in Figure4(b)). Higher vocational education should be highly valued and supported by the government and society. The vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform is more conducive to realize the scientific management of investment, which can give full play to the actual benefits and efficiency of diversified investment, promoting the active and steady development of higher vocational education to better serve the needs of social and economic development. Diversified management investment is an opportunity for enterprise groups to increase income, which reflects a trend of modern school management and development.Figure 4(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointProportion of teachers: (a) external teachers, (b) proportion of teachers by type.Figure 4(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointProportion of teachers: (a) external teachers, (b) proportion of teachers by type.The system provides a user"

The system provides a login interface. In the login interface, the user is only allowed to try to log in three times. If the three logins are unsuccessful, the system will automatically log out. During the same working period of the same client, the system is only allowed to be started once. Version deadlines are set by the system. When a new version of the system is launched, by modifying the system version number in the SQLserver2000 (a database management system) data table, the current version expires and cannot be used continuously, and the user is prompted to contact the academic affairs office to obtain the latest version of the system. Through user rights management, different users have different system interfaces, and the same user has different system interfaces in different working processes. Such a flexible system working mode is conducive to the safe operation of the system, which is closely integrated with the teaching management work.The input of the teacher information is completed through the teacher information selection interface, and the system automatically"

The system provides flexible query methods and the new semester course opening information can be exported. The vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform provides class teaching arrangement and report printing function arranged by teachers. The system can automatically calculate the total number of class hours of each teaching class and the total number of class hours of each teacher.Meanwhile, building an index is also an essential link, through which the location of the records to be searched can be quickly located. But obviously, using a sequential table is not as convenient as using an index table. The index is equivalent to the directory. The required resources can be found according to the directory.

"For the college, the system can further improve its own management system, allow the college's resources to be reasonably allocated, and promote the rapid transmission of the information released by the college. It can also continuously improve the efficiency of various departments of the college, reduce the management pressure of management workers, and continuously promote the reform of the school management mechanism, so that the college can better adapt to the requirements of today's informatization development. From the teacher's level, they can organize and summarize their own information through the system. If they find errors, they can also revise them. At the same time, it can also publish the recent course schedule according to its own teaching tasks or students' recent test scores. In this way, it can effectively save time and improve office efficiency. There is no need to communicate with each office when releasing a message like the traditional office. From the level of students, the system can provide management functions for every student in the college. Through this system, students can not only inquire about the time and place of class, recent exam results, etc., but also keep abreast of the notices issued by the college in a timely manner.Table  2.Course information of vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform.Double teacher ypeField nameType of dataField descriptionClass I dual-qualified teachersidint (30)Auto"

About 80% of the respondents in Z vocational colleges believed that Z vocational colleges had fair and effective supervision, evaluation, and assessment; 12% of the respondents thought that there was no such process, and 8% of the respondents thought that it was average. According to the interviews, the supervision of all stakeholders was a smooth and stable way. In addition, through interviews, it was found that the school's internal performance evaluation was very scientific, and it paid a lot of attention to stakeholders, especially the teaching staff who were struggling in the front line. Because of the characteristics of vocational schools, the work content of employees was diverse.

"the work content of employees was diverse. In addition to daily classroom teaching, there were many practical courses, which were conducted in practice bases or cooperative enterprises, and often required much more effort than classroom teaching. There were various forms of assessment in schools. Teaching was based on the amount of class hours, and the others were averages. No attention was paid to scientific research. Obviously, the supervision, evaluation, and assessment of Z vocational colleges can effectively play an incentive role for stakeholders within the school. The school had internal financial supervision, evaluation, and assessment. The school assessment situation is shown in Figure5. The functions realized by the system are from course management, to plan management, to course start, and teaching history information management. This management workflow absorbs and produces a large amount of teaching management information. While the system completes the relevant management work efficiently and with high quality, it also carefully maintains various management information. All kinds of information continuously enter this system. Through processing and conversion, standard information resources are formed for teaching management work. Through the network environment, the work efficiency of teaching management has been greatly improved.

A total of 50% of teachers were particularly satisfied with the tables generated by the discrete Fourier transform-based vocational education management system. They believed that the vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform was very fast in data processing, the processing speed of which was within 0.1 s. About 36% of teachers felt basically satisfied; 12% felt it was average, and only 2% felt very poor. It was learned from the interview that teachers who felt very poor believed that the data processing of the system was stuck, which is also where the system needs to continue to be optimized.

The operation has been prepared in terms of technology and management. In the trial operation stage, along with the realization of the workflow of each functional module, the college has compiled a detailed operation guide. In accordance with the work plan, the training of relevant users is carried out in time. The training is aimed at all relevant personnel of system operation, and timely answers various problems encountered in the operation of the system. The training process is also a process in which various management ideas collide with each other, and new problems are constantly discovered, accompanied by recognition and debate. These exchanges and interactions are very necessary for the operation and upgrading of the vocational education management system based on discrete Fourier transform.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointVocational education management system satisfaction survey based on discrete Fourier transform.4.

The DFT algorithm proposed in this paper is an efficient and fast address generation algorithm. The algorithm system automatically calculates data such as the average weekly credit hours of each semester, the total planned credit hours, the total credit hours of practical teaching, and the percentage of the total credit hours of different types of courses to the total planned credit hours. The software system studied in this paper really follows the thinking of \"people,\" and its fault-tolerant, error-correcting, and self-adaptive abilities are all very powerful. In addition, it has a very simple operation process and also provides support for reversible operations based on special requirements. The construction of higher vocational teaching management information under the network conditions is an important topic that higher vocational colleges pay more and more attention to. This paper will bring profound changes to higher vocational teaching management. This paper not only realizes the networkization of teaching plan management, course start plan management, and student achievement management but also realizes the standardization and information sharing of basic teaching management information.

"AbstractWith the continuous social and economic development, more and more attention has been paid to the safety and efficiency of the power grid. In this paper, the importance and technical support for the informatization and intelligent implementation of the smart grid are explored based on the complex scientific management thinking combined with MAS technology, with the smart grid as the breakthrough point. Subsequently, the framework structure of the smart grid information management system based on multiagent technology is put forward, focusing on expounding the design and functions of agents at the equipment level, subsystem level, and total system level in the system. The system functions are verified and analyzed through the test examples. The practice has proved that the smart grid information management system designed in this paper can provide technical support for smart grid informatization and intelligent implementation.1. IntroductionWith the continuous social and economic development, more and more attention has been paid to the safety and efficiency of the power grid [1-4]. Informatization and intelligence are a game changer to the power grid industry, and a novel type of information system that can cover the power grid comprehensively is the basis for implementing a smart power grid.

"power grid comprehensively is the basis for implementing a smart power grid. With the introduction and application of sensor networks, the operating status of power grid equipment, the peripheral working environment, and other pieces of information can be monitored, which has provided support for the implementation of informatization in the smart power grid [5-8]. Although the energy management system (EMS) has been extensively applied in power grid dispatching management, it still requires the direct involvement of dispatchers and distributed independent computation. Then dispatchers make decisions and process information based on experience, which can reduce the real-time performance and accuracy of dispatching operations [9-12]. As the scale of power grids is continuously expanded, with the deepening of the power market reform and the advent of the comprehensive construction of smart power grids, the operation mode and structural adjustment of the power system have become increasingly complicated, which has put forward more rigorous requirements on the psychological quality and operating experience of dispatchers. Upon failure of the power grid, massive alarm information will be displayed to the dispatcher right away, and it will be impossible for the dispatcher to analyze and process the information in a short time. It will also be highly challenging to make scientific and accurate processing decisions [13,14]. Hence, the operation of the power grid requires a dispatch"
"it will be impossible for the dispatcher to analyze and process the information in a short time. It will also be highly challenging to make scientific and accurate processing decisions [13,14]. Hence, the operation of the power grid requires a dispatch automation system with more comprehensive functions, more intelligent information processing, and more scientific decision-making urgently to improve the economy and safety in the operation of the power grid [15].Smart grid information management system (SGIMS) puts forward higher requirements, which requires it to evolve into a complex adaptive system (CAS) with intelligent characteristics, with good flexibility, scalability, and adaptability. It can not only effectively realize the data collection, prediction, and intelligent functions such as planning, self-organization, self-control, and auxiliary decision-making but also complete the optimal production, operation, and transaction of power in the complex information environment. It includes regular inspection and testing of the operation of key facilities in terms of regulatory control and data collection and the realization of scheduling and other auxiliary service functions based on a cost-effective mechanism. However, China's previous power information management mainly used EMS and other types of application software, which does not have the ability of intelligent information decision-making, so it is difficult to meet the complex information management requirements of"
"previous power information management mainly used EMS and other types of application software, which does not have the ability of intelligent information decision-making, so it is difficult to meet the complex information management requirements of smart grid. Vigorously developing information technology facilities matching the goal of smart grid has become an important application research field. At present, MAS technology is mostly used in the field of distributed artificial intelligence in complex system science and is also widely used in resource management, risk management, and network information system management. Similarly, MAS technology can also provide a feasible way for the function realization of smart grid information management system. At present, this technology and method have been preliminarily applied and studied in the fields of power line transmission application scenario of smart grid, structural design of distributed high-security control system, power dispatching, and system relay protection (such as wide-area backup protection, coordinated protection, online verification, and early warning system).In this paper, the design of the smart grid information management system is studied based on the complex scientific management thinking combined with the MAS technology, and the corresponding information management system is established.

"scientific management thinking combined with the MAS technology, and the corresponding information management system is established. Finally, the proposed system is verified and analyzed based on the practical data to explore the management analysis of the smart grid industry.2. Related Technologies and Methods2.1. MAS TechnologyThe electric power system is a real-time dynamic system composed of five essential links: power generation, transmission, transformation, power distribution, and power consumption. The prerequisites to ensure the stable operation of the electric power system are as follows. The system is required to meet two basic equations, that is, the equality constraint and the inequality constraint. Firstly, from the process of power reproduction, it can be divided into intelligent modules of power generation, transmission, transformation, distribution, and power consumption. These modules centralize the power demand information of users. Among them, the power generation information agent can support different power access, including a large amount of clean power generation information such as distributed power generation. The generation, transmission, transformation, and distribution information agent centralizes the power supply side information. The power information agent centralizes the power demand side information and can provide information services for power market transactions under the demand side response. Dispatching information agent centralizes a"
"the power supply side information. The power information agent centralizes the power demand side information and can provide information services for power market transactions under the demand side response. Dispatching information agent centralizes a large amount of power transaction information to realize power dispatching based on economic and environmental efficiency. The equation constraint condition for the electric power system means that the active power and reactive power of the system shall maintain a dynamic balance in real time, which can be expressed by equations (1) and (2):(1)PGiandQGistand for the active power and reactive power generated by theith power supply in the system;nstands for the number of power nodes;PandQrepresent the active power and reactive power of power in the system;PskandQskstand for the active and reactive power loss of theK-th power transmission and transformation equipment in the system;mstands for the number of loads in the system.(2)Ui,min,Ui, andUi,maxstand for the voltage and upper and lower limits of thei-th power supply of the bus, respectively;fmin,f, andfmaxstand for the frequency and upper and lower limits of the system, respectively;PGi,min,PGi, andPGi,maxstand for the upper and lower limits of the active power output of thei-th generator, respectively;QGi,min,QGi, andQGi,maxstand for the upper and lower limits of the reactive power output of thei-th generator, respectively.The power grid dispatching system is a real-time"
"and lower limits of the active power output of thei-th generator, respectively;QGi,min,QGi, andQGi,maxstand for the upper and lower limits of the reactive power output of thei-th generator, respectively.The power grid dispatching system is a real-time dynamic system with a huge amount of information and a large scale. For the safe, economical, and high-quality operation of the power grid, it is required to deal with the minimization of system network loss, the stability of voltage quality and frequency quality at the same time, and other issues, which can be regarded as an ultrahigh-dimensional, nonlinear, and differential equation-inequality constraint conditional variation problem. Its mathematical model is shown in equations (3) and (4):(3)(4)wherex∈RnandX∈Rn(in whichRis a real number) stand for the state vector and output vector of the power system,u∈Rrstands for the control vector;f(x,u) is the first-order state equation; Δfand ΔVstand for the voltage and frequency dynamic deviation of the node, respectively. As the nodes in the power grid are huge and complex, it is impossible to solve the aforesaid problem in a short time (10 s), which is also the reason why the dispatch automation system can only be used for analysis but not for global solution control at present.Interaction with the environment is a prerequisite for the technical work of the agent. Subsequently, the environmental information received is processed. The working process is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open"
"but not for global solution control at present.Interaction with the environment is a prerequisite for the technical work of the agent. Subsequently, the environmental information received is processed. The working process is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointWorking process of the agent.The multiagent system, referred to as MAS for short, is a set of multiple agents. The individual agents in the set collaborate with each other to implement a specific function. Upon implementation of the information relationship, control relationship, and solution mode among the internal agents of MAS, there are some differences in the organizational structure. When the organizational structures are different, the information storage, sharing, and communication methods between agents can be determined. When the organizational structures are the same, the agents have the same information communication mechanism. Hence, the organizational structures of MAS can be divided into three types based on various management modes and service mechanisms: centralized, distributed, and hybrid. Their structures are shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointOrganizational form of the MAS.The operation of the system requires the establishment of a common platform, while the SACDA, EMS, and DMS applied in the dispatch automation system at present work independently in different environments.

"the establishment of a common platform, while the SACDA, EMS, and DMS applied in the dispatch automation system at present work independently in different environments. It is highly challenging to coordinate the relationship between the three. Hence, it is necessary to establish a system platform with a layered and distributed architecture. The functional modules of the system should be independent of each other, and coordinated operation should be maintained, which cannot be met based on the traditional object-oriented technology. The MAS technology is applied to the field of the power dispatch automation system, and the latest cutting-edge technologies are integrated, such as computer technology, information processing technology, and communication technology. The EMS is upgraded to an agent-based intelligent dispatch control system, and an intelligent dispatch management model is established, which has provided an effective solution to the complex and changeable issues in the power system.2.2.

"The single agent of the smart grid information management system herein mainly refers to the subagents such as transmission lines, transformers, and circuit breakers at the equipment level, the subagents at each voltage level in the subsystem, and the subagents of the overall system. The aforesaid subagents acquire real-time data information of the power grid through the monitoring system and other agents and analyze and evaluate the current state of themselves and the environment.The results are shared with other agents and then combined with the state of the power grid to develop the control strategy in the next step, cooperate with other agents to accomplish the control task, finally organize the analysis results and control strategy into a log and report to the superior agent, and wait for further instructions from the superior agent.The design of a single agent is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointDesign of a single agent.The smart grid-oriented information management system established in this paper is mainly composed of three types of agents: agent at the total system level, agent at the subsystem (substation) level, and agent at the equipment level.

The difference only lies in the algorithm implementation. In addition, the agents of the state monitoring module and the execution module are different at all levels, and agents at various levels have different information sources and control objects.The smart power grid information management system based on the multiagent system (MAS) is composed of subagents, as shown in Figure3. The multiagent system (MAS) is composed of multiple loosely coupled, coarse-grained agents. While taking the advantages of the single-agent system into consideration, the critical point is that the function-independent agents can accomplish complex distributed tasks and solve the problems through collaboration with each other.In this paper, the star network is adopted as the communication mode to meet the demand of the rapid and accurate interaction of a large amount of information in the smart power grid. The communication module of the upper-level agent in each subagent group also takes the coordination of the communication between the subagents into consideration and functions as the central server of each subagent and the transfer station for information flow. The network address, geographic location, electrical properties, and other pieces of information of each subagent are stored in the database. The system design is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in"
"subagent and the transfer station for information flow. The network address, geographic location, electrical properties, and other pieces of information of each subagent are stored in the database. The system design is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointDesign diagram of the multiagent system structure.In Figure4,Astands for the total system agent (agent),Aistands for the subsystem (substation) and equipment subagent at the highest voltage level in the system, andAijstands for the subsystem (substation) and equipment subagent at the subvoltage level in the system. The two-way connection line between the agents stands for the communication connection existing between the agents, and the solid line stands for the static connection (the connection has been fixed from the system startup to the shutdown and will not be released). The dotted line stands for dynamic connection (it is required to obtain the address of the other party from the server for information interaction, establish a two-way connection, and release the connection after the interaction to save the system resources).In the implementation of the system, the communication information between the agents is formatted based on the unified FIPA standard. The interaction between the agents is reflected in two aspects: (1) Information sharing: the basic operating status and monitoring information of the power grid by the agents, as well as the analysis result information, can be acquired by other"
"standard. The interaction between the agents is reflected in two aspects: (1) Information sharing: the basic operating status and monitoring information of the power grid by the agents, as well as the analysis result information, can be acquired by other agents that have been granted authority. ② Collaborate and coordinate to accomplish the tasks: the regulation and operation in the power grid are not independent. Instead, they are interrelated and mutually affected. Hence, the agents will send task assistance requests to the other agents based on the requirements of the tasks and request the operation of the automated electrical components or equipment of other agents. The other agents are required to determine and process the received requests and send back the processing results. The requester determines the actions in the next step based on the request processing results. The aforesaid two major types of information are subdivided into more specific information. Each type of information has a different tag. The analysis module will call different algorithms to process the information based on its tag.3. Simulation Implementation3.1. Establishment of the Multiagent SystemThe multiagent system is composed of single agents, and the specific workflow chart of the single agents is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointWorkflow chart of a single agent.When the agent is idle, it is set to a standby state to reduce power consumption.

"and the specific workflow chart of the single agents is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointWorkflow chart of a single agent.When the agent is idle, it is set to a standby state to reduce power consumption. As shown in Figure5, there are two types of wake-up: active wake-up and passive wake-up:①Active wake-up: the agent evaluates and regulates itself and the environment on a regular basis. The steps are described as follows:(a)The agent actively sends measurement commands to each measurement unit at a regular interval, acquires the monitoring data from the database in real time, sends information sharing requests to other agents when necessary, and remotely obtains data from other agents.(b)After the data preparation is completed, the agent analyzes and evaluates the system based on the data, stores the results in the work log, and reports the results to the superior agent.(c)With the evaluation results as the basis, the system conducts decision-making analysis and deploys the targeted strategic tasks.(d)Determine whether the task can be completed independently. If the task is completed, the activity is recorded in the log and reported to the superior agent, and then the process is ended. If not, proceed to Step (e).(e)Request assistance from the corresponding other agents to complete the task together. If a positive reply is obtained, proceed to Step (d) to complete the task to be completed by itself, and the process is ended. Otherwise, the situation is"
"to Step (e).(e)Request assistance from the corresponding other agents to complete the task together. If a positive reply is obtained, proceed to Step (d) to complete the task to be completed by itself, and the process is ended. Otherwise, the situation is reported to the superior agent, waiting for the comprehensive control of the superior agent, and then the process is ended.②Passive wake-up: in the standby state, the agent will receive information from the external environment. After it has received the requests from other agents, the system begins to analyze and evaluate the aforesaid requests, determine whether to execute the requests, and give the response accordingly. If it agrees to perform the task requested by the other party, it will wait for the specific task instructions from the other party after sending the message and reply to the other party regarding the completion status of the specific task after the task is completed. If the request is rejected, the process ends after the rejection message is sent, and the agent reenters the standby state, waiting for the next message.After the behavioral rules for system analysis, communication, collaboration, and other aspects of the single agent are designed, the operation mode of the multiagent system will be essentially determined as well.After the agent is started, its first action is to initialize the communication module, send registration information to the communication management agent of the agent group that"
"mode of the multiagent system will be essentially determined as well.After the agent is started, its first action is to initialize the communication module, send registration information to the communication management agent of the agent group that acts as a server, and register its related information, including name, location, category, working method, and communication IP address. After the registration is completed, the communication management agent stores the information of the registration agent in the communication database and adds the agent to the online agent list, which indicates that the agent is in a communicable state.The multiagents have two communication modes, vertical and horizontal, as shown in Figure6. In the horizontal communication mode, the address of the other party is obtained by sending an address request to the server, then a two-way connection for communication alone is established, and the link is released after the communication is completed. In the vertical communication mode, as the connection between the upper-level agent and the lower-level one has been maintained, messages can be sent directly to implement one-to-one or one-to-many communication with online agents. The accuracy and safety of information transmission are taken into consideration, and TCP/IP protocol is used for communication in normal circumstances. The connectionless UDP protocol communication is taken as a backup communication method for special moments.Figure 6Open in"
"of information transmission are taken into consideration, and TCP/IP protocol is used for communication in normal circumstances. The connectionless UDP protocol communication is taken as a backup communication method for special moments.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the communication mode.The communication process between agents is described as follows:①Action process of the agent of the sender:(a)The analysis and decision-making module transmits the original information to be sent to the coordination module. The information shall include the information type label and the specific contents.(b)The coordination module determines the priority of the message based on the type and content of the information and adds it to the information content.(c)The communication module formats and packages the information according to the FIPA standards, adds attributes such as sender, time, and information ID, and places the original information into the content item (content). The protocol of the language used in the original information is encapsulated into the language item (language). After the encapsulation is completed, the communication module sends the information packet to the receiving agent according to the TCP/IP protocol.②Action flow of the receiving agent:(a)The communication module unpacks the received information, acquires the information attributes and contents, and transmits them to the coordination module.(b)The coordination module"
"according to the TCP/IP protocol.②Action flow of the receiving agent:(a)The communication module unpacks the received information, acquires the information attributes and contents, and transmits them to the coordination module.(b)The coordination module consolidates the time, sender priority, and other indexes to determine the priority of the message, insert the information into the corresponding position of the message buffer area in the coordination module based on the determination result, and wait for processing.(c)After the processing is completed, the analysis module starts to process the information. The analysis module calls the corresponding algorithm based on the type of message to carry out the analysis. If it is information sharing information, proceed to Step (d). If it is task request information, proceed to Step (e).(d)Firstly, determine whether the reply message is sent by the system. If so, return to the process of sending the message in the analysis module and proceed to the next step. If not, call the information sharing information processing algorithm to analyze and process the information, acquire the information from the corresponding database or algorithm, and reply to the sender agent.(e)Firstly, determine whether the reply message is sent by the system. If so, return to the process of sending the message in the analysis module and proceed to the next step. If not, call the task request information processing algorithm to analyze the information, and"
"whether the reply message is sent by the system. If so, return to the process of sending the message in the analysis module and proceed to the next step. If not, call the task request information processing algorithm to analyze the information, and finally reply to the processing method of the aforesaid request to the sender agent.3.2. Design of the DatabaseNo. 1 main transformer of a substation is taken as an example to illustrate the specific working mode of the system, such as the temperature measurement and evaluation. The data include the temperature, electric field strength, the state of the cooling device, and the gas content in the oil as environmental measurement variables, as well as fixed data such as transformer parameters. For compliance with the comprehensive requirement of the algorithm, there is also some shared information from other devices; the measurement data are prestored in the database, and the actual situation is simulated for the reading sequence.Based on the information that indicates the operating status of the transformer and the external environment acquired based on the wireless sensor network, the agent evaluates the health status of the transformer by calling the analysis algorithm in the analysis module. In this case, the evaluation result is that the transformer is in a seriously aging state, which is determined to have a high failure probability.The agent can acquire the information on the evaluation results of other agents at the same"
"analysis module. In this case, the evaluation result is that the transformer is in a seriously aging state, which is determined to have a high failure probability.The agent can acquire the information on the evaluation results of other agents at the same level (transformer 2, transformer 3, and transmission line 2) as a reference, combined with the evaluation results of its own health status, and call the fault diagnosis and fault prediction algorithm to analyze the transformer. In this case, the primary consideration is that the transformer may have a relatively high probability of low energy discharge (44.8%), low energy discharge and overheating (32.61%), and other types of faults based on the results of DGA fault diagnosis according to the prediction. The corresponding decision and control strategy are made according to the analysis situation, and the analysis conclusion is drawn to perform electric isolation of the transformer. In addition, the maintenance personnel are warned to carry out overhaul and replacement accordingly.After the execution module receives the task for electrical isolation of the transformer from the decision-making, it determines the specific operation plan based on the specific grid situation: disconnect the circuit breakers 3311, 3310, 3312, 3501, and 1101 that are connected to the transformer. Among them, circuit breaker 1101 is connected to the equipment-level agent in transmission line 2. The agent sends a message to request the cooperation"
"disconnect the circuit breakers 3311, 3310, 3312, 3501, and 1101 that are connected to the transformer. Among them, circuit breaker 1101 is connected to the equipment-level agent in transmission line 2. The agent sends a message to request the cooperation of the transmission line agent to disconnect circuit breaker 1101. After the overall operation is completed, the execution result is fed back and recorded in the log.The above analysis and control results are reported to the upper-level system agent. After the upper-level system agent receives the notification on the application for the maintenance of No. 1 transformer, it reschedules the grid operation mode when the transformer is disconnected. The load of main transformer 1 is transferred and shared by transformers 2 and 3, and the specific operation is completed through the execution module. This case has briefly explained the functions of the smart grid information management system based on the multiagent technology.(1)Management and coordination agent: it coordinates and manages the relationship between multiple agents in the system and develops a series of decision-making plans for the choice of dispatchers based on the auxiliary decision-making information acquired from the qualitative and quantitative analysis provided by other agents in the system using the corresponding decision-making methods and knowledge.(2)System monitoring agent: it monitors the operation of multiple application systems and collects online"

During the regular operation, it continuously provides information about the overall economic efficiency, network loss, and thermal efficiency of the system that occur and put forward suggestions and solutions on how to reduce the loss and improve the efficiency (Figure7).(5)Safety analysis agent: the corresponding models and algorithms are applied in real time (such as the calculation of power flow, state estimation, real-time network analysis, scheduling of safety constraint, analysis of voltage stability, and analysis of predictive failure) and in support of safety assessments of the system. During the regular operation of the system, it can issue an early alert of distress to inform the weaknesses of the system in real time. At the same time, it can also offer suggestions and provide strategies to improve safety and stability so that the power system can always maintain a normal operating state.(6)Human-computer interaction agent: the interfaces of various application systems are integrated and unified to implement a centralized virtual console for regional power grid dispatchers.

The aforesaid professions include dispatchers, monitors, mode personnel, and load personnel at various levels. The training content not only includes the simulation operation of the power grid but also has integrated the various systems used by the dispatching professionals in practice, including the dispatching management system, the image monitoring system, the power site management system, and the trading system of the power market. The training of functions is completed, such as power grid dispatching, filling of the operation ticket, load forecasting, method arrangement, power market transaction, handling of system accidents, and prediction of accidents.(8)Electric power market agent: the scheme for power market operation is developed by collecting and consolidating information on grid operation, users, environment, policies, and other aspects, including the estimated load, planning, analysis, and statistics, to ensure that the regional power supply bureau can secure the most economic transactions in the electric"

"AbstractWith the increase in the number of college students, the problem of family poverty among college students has also attracted the attention of colleges and universities. There are still many problems to be solved in the link of university funding. This article takes college students as the management object and designs a set of college funding information management system to complete the information management of college funding information for college students. The system adopts distributed and modular design ideas, divided into two parts, software and hardware, and uses MySQL as the back-end database to research and design a set of B/S university funding information management system. The system not only improves work efficiency but also ensures the safety and accuracy of data. We first tested the pressure performance of the system, and the final result shows that the system has good robustness. Then, we investigated the attitudes of impoverished students from 120 colleges and universities towards the information management system of college funding from 2016 to 2021. Combining with the data obtained from the survey and sorting and analyzing the data, the survey results show that at least 83.54% of poor students believe that this system has a greater effect on the information management of poor students.

With the widespread application of information technology, which has promoted the rapid development of all walks of life, how to improve the level of accurate funding for students through information management has become a concern of many universities. This article briefly discusses and analyzes the information management of precision funding for college students, hoping to play a leading role in improving the efficiency and ability of precision funding. The rapid development of digital networks has made information management systems a powerful means of managing college students. Relying on various information management systems, colleges and universities have achieved remarkable results in poverty alleviation.

"and performance evaluation. This urgently needs to broaden the functional connotation of the funding information management system and overcome platform obstacles, closely integrating funding work with talent training elements to improve students' learning, practice, and entrepreneurial innovation capabilities. Through public welfare services to poor students, cultivate the concept of contributing to society, serving society, and giving back to society.There have been a lot of researches on wireless communication and information management. Chen et al. researched the sources (RM) of hybrid wireless communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure, where radio frequency and electrical communication seem to be intertwined. An MRI algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem and the simulation results confirm the efficient operation of the Chen algorithm [1]. Boussadi et al. proposed a new multicore architecture specifically for embedded video and image processing applications. They proposed a flexible multicore approach with two architectures. One is implemented using CMOS65nm technology containing 16 open-source blocks, and the other is implemented using CMOSFD-SOI28nm technology containing 64 open-source blocks. Each block of these architectures can select its communication link based on the overall parallel scheme most relevant to the target application. Both chips have complete functions in simulation [2].

"Each block of these architectures can select its communication link based on the overall parallel scheme most relevant to the target application. Both chips have complete functions in simulation [2]. Chen and Qin designed an embedded application system based on iris recognition technology to realize the functions of iris information collection, input, registration, and recognition. The iris sensor is used to collect iris information and complete the software development on the embedded operating system Windows CE. The system can be used for company access control systems, airport customs security, criminal identification, etc. [3]. Hwang et al. investigated the deep-routing- (MADRL) based resource allocation method for the multicore wireless communication network (WPCN), where most hybrid access points (H-APs) transmit in wireless mode to users with limited power to retrieve data from them. Hwang et al. designed a distributed stability training system in which H-AP independently determined time and power distribution variables. The digital results show that the proposed method can achieve the same functionality as the central algorithm [4]. The data results of these studies are not accurate, and there is a certain degree of contingency in the research, which leads to the research results not being adopted by the public [5,6].The hardware part of the college funding information management system designed by the institute has the advantages of small size, low cost, low power"

The software part has the advantages of easy upgrade and real-time performance [7]. A good system can provide good services to poor students in colleges and universities. At the same time, in response to the problems and countermeasures of university funding information management, this study provides a multifaceted reference, which is more conducive to university information management [8].2. University Funding Information Management SystemThe college funding information management system is mainly divided into two parts: software and hardware [9]. The hardware system includes a wireless communication module, and the software system includes an operating system and a database [10]. The hardware part is the foundation and the carrier of the software part, and the software part makes the hardware part have use value. The two complement each other and are indispensable.

One is to support multicenter data communication in terms of communication, the other is to support the collection of required data in terms of collection, and the third is to support remote management of data in terms of remote management [12,13]. The main feature of the wireless communication module is that it is suitable for outdoor harsh environments. It supports transparent data transmission and domain name resolution function and supports various configuration software and user-developed software systems [14]. The wireless communication module has the advantages of low cost, good adaptability, good scalability, and convenient equipment maintenance in terms of data transmission [15].

Software System Design2.2.1. Operate SystemThe software development part of the system is realized based on the operating system. Development based on the operating system has the advantages of reduced development difficulty, real-time number, and easy portability [16]. The mainstream embedded operating systems now include Linux, UCOS, NuttX, VxWorks, and Windows CE. The specific performance analysis of these operating systems is shown in Table2[17].2.Embedded operating system performance analysis.NameMaximum number of tasks supportedTask scheduling methodsOpen source or notLinuxNot limitedGrabby/time pieceYesUCOS64PreemptiveYesNuttXNot limitedGrabby/time pieceYesVxWorks256PreemptiveNoWindows CE256PreemptiveNoCombined with the performance of the operating system and the system design requirements, the Linux system is selected as the operating system for this design.

"to information management.Whether it is the Microsoft .NET concept or the SUN SUN ONE concept, it is the integration of basic operating systems and software applications, which will be the development direction of the computer industry [18]. Aiming at the trend of B/S mode control information, a development platform model has been proposed [19]. There is no doubt that the information management development system based on the B/S model will become the main structure of the information management system [20].Compared with C/S, B/S has the following main advantages:(1)In the use of the system, it reduces the installation of client software. It is simple and easy to use, making the system easier to use [21](2)For the future development of the system, it places high demands on developers, especially the system version and compatibility that need to be considered and save time by directly using existing browsers(3)From the perspective of system maintenance, only the server needs to be updated; it will not cause any client problems and can reduce maintenance costsIn the future, the development of an information management system based on the B/S model will become the main structure of the information management system.The main characteristics of the B/S structure are strong distribution, easy maintenance, easy development, strong sharing, and common ownership.

"characteristics of the B/S structure are strong distribution, easy maintenance, easy development, strong sharing, and common ownership. It is very cheap, easy to implement a crossplatform layout, and easy to coordinate local area networks and wide area networks. It is particularly suitable for information distribution software [22].This design is based on the B/S framework, so it is necessary to understand the working principle of the B/S framework. B/S architecture is implemented in two ways: browser request and server response. Each web server can connect to the database server in several ways. The structure of the specific B/S architecture is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.2.2. DatabaseThe database system exists independently and provides users with a unified data request interface. Different software can issue data processing requests through a unified database language, and the specific data operations are all done by the database system itself. This data independence and sharing feature saves a lot of costs for software developers, which allows a substantial breakthrough in the functions of computer software. This truly realizes that a piece of software provides a unified service for a large number of users at the same time [23].The process of storing data in the database: call the stored procedure, and pass in the user name and password parameters.The database serves as the data storage center.

Choosing a database suitable for the system is very helpful for data processing such as data call and query. Combining system design requirements and comparing database functions, MySQL was finally selected as the back-end database for this design. The MySQL database is open source and cost-effective and has better performance than databases such as MsSqlserver and Oracle. The structure diagram of MySQL is shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointSimply put, MySQL database has the following three advantages:(1)The number of users accessing the database at the same time will not be limited(2)Save up to 50 million records(3)It is the fastest database system currently in useThe server-side processing flow is shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe full name of MVC is Model View Controller. It is the abbreviation of Model-View-Controller. It is a framework pattern used to separate business logic and data display logic, which is different from design patterns.

Algorithms Used by the SystemThis time the system uses the EM algorithm; the EM algorithm acts as an iterative optimisation in the session of data storage optimisation, which will facilitate real-time data updates. Since the samples in series A are independent and distributed as points, only type B samples can be plotted to calculate vector C. Assume that the known pattern is defined as(1)For the likelihood function, the joint probability density functionq(R|δ) is called the likelihood function of {x1,x2, ⋯,xN} relative toδ.(2)Ifis theδvalue that increases the maximum probability of thej(δ) function in the parameter domain, thenshould be the \"most\" parameter value; then,is the maximum probability calculation ofδ.

Problems and Countermeasures of Information Management of University FundingHow to achieve fair, just, and open poverty alleviation has always been a problem that needs to be solved in the process of poverty alleviation. In the process of university funding information management, there are still deficiencies and problems that need to be resolved from different aspects. The problems existing in the current university funding information management are sorted out and summarized by means of interviews and investigations, and corresponding countermeasures are given. The following is an explanation of the problems and solutions presented in the four aspects.3.1. Identification of Poor Students Based on Information ManagementThe steps for identifying poor students in colleges and universities are as follows: first, students submit applications based on their own situation, and then, class organizers conduct democratic voting and report the results to the college. Then, the college organizes teachers to conduct democratic evaluation and publicity based on the student's family situation and then report it to the school. Finally, the school arranges personnel to review the poor student list based on factors such as student performance and family economic conditions, to determine"
"and publicity based on the student's family situation and then report it to the school. Finally, the school arranges personnel to review the poor student list based on factors such as student performance and family economic conditions, to determine candidates for poor students and establish a bank of poor students. The process before entering the library is to work on-site manually and organize student information in the form of paper materials. This may be due to some factors such as interpersonal relationships and poor understanding of the situation, which caused the students who should have been selected as the poor student list to not be selected, and some students with good family financial status were selected into the poor student bank.In fact, to solve the problems listed, we can proceed from the following aspects. First of all, the school's system platform realizes data sharing, so that you can better and faster understand the personal situation of students. In addition, the identification of poor students should be considered from many aspects. It should not be judged solely based on the family's economic status. It should be combined with student behavior, consumption information, loan status, etc. as the criteria for identification of poor students. Only in this way can we achieve fairness and justice and realize true \"precise poverty alleviation.\"3.2. The Improvement of Academic and Professional Ability Based on Information ManagementThe real purpose of college"
"for identification of poor students. Only in this way can we achieve fairness and justice and realize true \"precise poverty alleviation.\"3.2. The Improvement of Academic and Professional Ability Based on Information ManagementThe real purpose of college funding is to provide poor students with the guarantee that they can complete their studies safely. The ultimate manifestation lies in whether the students' personal abilities have improved and they can adapt well to the social environment. However, poor students generally need to be improved in terms of practical ability and communication ability, and their social adaptability is poor. Therefore, the problem that needs to be solved is to improve the ability of students through university funding.The school can first help students to clarify a development direction for future employment. Secondly, analyze the shortcomings of students based on their performance in all aspects, so as to make some changes and work towards a better direction. In addition, some activities are carried out to assist students in achieving self-management and self-learning ability improvement.In addition, colleges and universities can provide students with some internship opportunities, such as work-study programs and innovation and entrepreneurship bases. At the same time, certain requirements are made for students during the internship, so as to ensure that students can get as much improvement as possible during the internship.3.3. Volunteer Service"
"programs and innovation and entrepreneurship bases. At the same time, certain requirements are made for students during the internship, so as to ensure that students can get as much improvement as possible during the internship.3.3. Volunteer Service Based on Information ManagementAlthough it is advisable for students to provide part-time work-study and volunteer services, it is difficult to guarantee the quality and efficiency of student services if the two are not integrated with the university funding management platform. The service quality of students cannot be judged and assessed based on data. Volunteers are short of funds for organizing activities and often seek sponsorships. There is also a volunteer service that goes through the scene and organizes a group to consume some materials, which leads to bad habits for the students. All these indicate that voluntary service lacks good information management.In this regard, there are the following solutions: first of all, a standard should be formulated regarding service quality, combining the standard with the system platform to form a complete system. Whether it is judging the service quality of volunteers or rewarding and punishing volunteers, they are all implemented in strict accordance with the system. Then, the various expenses of volunteer activities must be reviewed and reported and other procedures are used to strictly control the use and flow of funds. Finally, as much as possible, allow volunteers to carry out"
"in strict accordance with the system. Then, the various expenses of volunteer activities must be reviewed and reported and other procedures are used to strictly control the use and flow of funds. Finally, as much as possible, allow volunteers to carry out professional-related volunteer service positions, which can better improve students' professional skills.3.4. Low Information Entry EfficiencyThe inputting efficiency of university funding management information is low, and the information cannot be input into the system in time, and the real-time transmission of information cannot be realized. Information entry generally has two methods: students self-filling in and the class unified entry. This leads to situations such as missed recording, wrong recording, and nonstandard format of information. Moreover, the basic personal information of students is entered and quoted by the admission office, so there are situations that need to be reviewed and the information needs to be changed. Therefore, the efficiency of information entry is not high.For these situations, the system can be upgraded first, using recognition technology for automatic information entry. For nonstandard or missing information, errors can be reported automatically, and then, the school administrator can correct these errors. In addition, for the basic information part, it is necessary to realize the unification of the data of each school system, so that inconsistent information can be avoided.3.5."
"automatically, and then, the school administrator can correct these errors. In addition, for the basic information part, it is necessary to realize the unification of the data of each school system, so that inconsistent information can be avoided.3.5. Experiment ResultPerform data processing tests on the system's database. It includes three test items: empty table insertion, data selection, and data deletion. The test method of empty table insertion is to select student information data and insert 100,000 records, and the test consumes time. The test method of data selection is to select 1000 records from a 2000-record table, and the test consumes time. The test method of data deletion is to delete 1000 records from a 2000-record table, and the test consumes time. Test items are tested multiple times to reduce accidental errors. The specific test results are shown in Table3.3.Stress test table.Test itemsTest methodsTest resultsEmpty table insertSelect student information data, insert 100,000 records40.781 secondsData selectionSelect 1000 records for a table with 2000 records0.01 secondsData deletionDelete 1000 records from the 2000-record table0.07 secondsAccording to the test results, the following conclusions are drawn:(1)In the conventional large-capacity and large-recording environment, the performance can be maintained at a high level(2)Performing an empty table insertion operation has a greater impact on the performance of the system(3)The database server used in this"

In addition, it also shows that the system design needs to improve the performance of the system as much as possible, so that there is no delay in the data, which brings a bad interactive experience to the user.The number of browser connections will vary depending on the number of users. The specific changes are shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFigure6(a)shows the number of connections generated by the browser under different numbers of users.

"the number of connections generated by the browser under different numbers of users. Figure6(b)shows the number of stable connections of the browser under different numbers of users. It can be found that when the number of users exceeds a certain value, the number of stable connections in the browser will decrease, which also shows that the number of users still has a certain impact on the operation of the system.The browser's connection hit rate and the number of simultaneous requests vary with the number of users. The specific changes are shown in Figure7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFigure7(a)is a stress test of the connection hit rate, and Figure7(b)is a stress test of the number of simultaneous requests. The test results of the two performance graphs show that as the number of users increases, the number of connections and simultaneous requests of the system decreases. At the same time, it shows that the increase in the number of users will also cause the system to face tremendous pressure. We can find the balance of system performance by observing these changes. This balance point will determine the maximum number of users that the system can access at the same time.120 colleges and universities were selected to investigate the situation of poor students from 2016 to 2021, as shown in Figure8.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFigure8(a)shows the number of poor students in colleges and universities from 2016"

On the whole, poor students are quite satisfied with the information management system for university funding.4.

"system, it is constantly changing with the change of demand and cannot be changed again after the software system is formed. During the development and maintenance of database application software systems using B/S architecture and component systems, developers can update them as required. Adjust the corresponding layers and their components through different software levels and their components to realize the transition from the old system to the new software system, so that it can adapt to changing needs. In the past, system maintenance can only cost a lot of money, sacrificing a lot of time to redevelop the system or modifying the original system a lot.The university funding information management system adopts the B/S architecture model. According to the modeling theory, it uses Microsoft Visio modeling analysis and uses mature architecture and technology to construct. The background is MySQL database platform. The system can not only meet the requirements of college student funding work and complete the funding work accurately and efficiently but also realize student funding informatization, networking, and efficiency. It has strong practicability and popularization. The system has played a good role in assisting information management, but with the discovery of problems, the system still needs to be updated in real time, so it will consume more manpower and material resources.The original intention of the university funding information management system is to better"
"management, but with the discovery of problems, the system still needs to be updated in real time, so it will consume more manpower and material resources.The original intention of the university funding information management system is to better achieve fair and just \"precise poverty alleviation.\" The system designed this time has indeed brought great help to impoverished college students. Both in terms of satisfaction with the experience of poor students in colleges and universities and in terms of management efficiency, tremendous improvements have been made. At the same time, when studying the issue of university funding informatization management, a survey was used to summarize the discussions of poor college students on the problems of university funding informatization. This not only allows a more comprehensive understanding of the essence of the matter but also allows us to look at the problem from the essence, so as to draw the countermeasures we need to solve the problem. This can help research to be more detailed and accurate.5. ConclusionIn short, just like teaching activities, student funding is also part of university education and training. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, there are still many problems that need to be resolved in the process of funding information management.

"are still many problems that need to be resolved in the process of funding information management. It is very necessary to actively explore the problems in the development process of college student financial aid information management and find effective countermeasures. In the development process, make full use of the advantages of computer network technology, provide sufficient resources for students' study and life, and help every student to benefit from high-quality learning conditions. The financial information management of colleges and universities should target poor college students, so as to promote the process of identifying poor students, sharing data, and providing specific assistance, at the same time, developing the function of the information platform, incorporating voluntary services into the information management and evaluation system, and cultivating students' sense of responsibility, social identity, and gratitude. Through the improvement of students' professional skills, practical skills, and professional skills, the psychological and economic dual poverty can be finally achieved. Taking poor students as the main performance appraisal subject, listen to the opinions of aid recipients to ensure the effectiveness of the policy.Conflicts of InterestThe authors state that this article has no conflict of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.References1Chen"

"AbstractThe resource management platform based on the resource library has different structures, which brings a lot of inconvenience to the sharing of educational resources. However, the scale of the school is constantly expanding, the number of campuses and departments within the school increases, and the number of teachers and students increases. These new circumstances need the development of an open, secure, and effective school administration system that can operate online at any time and from any location. The \"plan norm model\" of educational management decision-making goals controls the decision-making dynamic structure. Whether the decision-making object is an \"economic man\" or a \"social man,\" its dynamic structure is built on a top-down control sequence, with the only variation being the control mechanisms used. In colleges and universities, educational administration management is an essential aspect of educational management. It is a work with strong timeliness, heavy workload, and high accuracy requirements, affecting the overall situation of teaching. This paper proposes an information integration platform based on SOA, which integrates various enterprise application systems into a unified platform by using a loose coupling structure, realizes information sharing among application systems, and meets the needs of cross-departmental enterprise business. As a new architecture idea, service-oriented architecture can package existing assets and reuse existing assets."
"coupling structure, realizes information sharing among application systems, and meets the needs of cross-departmental enterprise business. As a new architecture idea, service-oriented architecture can package existing assets and reuse existing assets. It can also minimize the impact of demand changes because its implementation is loosely coupled. When users need to add or modify a function, they only need to make a few modifications in the presentation layer or business process layer.1. IntroductionWith the increasing size of schools and the increasing number of students and teachers, the work of school administration has become more and more confusing [1]. It is mainly manifested in the lack of smooth administration, lack of information, lack of data sharing, lack of easy access to data, duplication of work, low work efficiency, and parents and students not being informed of their school situation in a timely manner [2]. Generally speaking, educational management decision-making goals should be consistent with the overall goals of educational organizations, and this consistency can be used as a specific criterion to measure the performance of actual decision-making [3]. With the introduction of computers at all levels of educational management in China and their application to some extent, they have played a positive role in improving the office level of educational management [4]. Nowadays, more and more schools have established their own educational resource libraries and"
