"and cultures (Doyle & Brubaker,2023). Cross-population issues ofequityhave also been largely unexplored, like those of race (Sutherland,2023) and access to services, education, and technology (Nemer,2015; Scheerder et al.,2017). Such issues apply no less to death- and legacy-related matters of information than any other aspect of it. In other words, there is not only a so-called digital divide, but adigital death divide, which must be addressed in both the contents and conduct of future research. That is, it should not only be addressed by targeted research questions, but also improved by a wider perspective and (e.g.) inclusive research collaborations. The reviewed literature also recognizes that online environments can bring together practices across communities and cultures, but that they mayconflict(Gach et al.,2017). Clear moral and ethical norms and legal regulations are expected to exist in such environments to help individuals, families, community groups, and the death industry to minimize harm and maximize well-being and support. However, the literature reveals many gaps in this area, especially around legal enforcement and responsibility.Further omissions of equity topics in the literature surround gender and sexuality, which have been recently identified as important factors in PIM (Cushing & Kerrigan,2022) and which likely also extend to information and death. Queer people have unique experiences and challenges managing their identity online (Fox & Ralston,2016;"
"which have been recently identified as important factors in PIM (Cushing & Kerrigan,2022) and which likely also extend to information and death. Queer people have unique experiences and challenges managing their identity online (Fox & Ralston,2016; McInroy & Craig,2015) and extending that management across death and legacy (online or offline) may be similarly unique, for example when managing identity-related data like deadnames and pre-transition images. Death studies scholars have proposed queer death studies (Radomska et al.,2020); we suggest the study of death and information must likewise consider the intersection of equity and identity.Technology is an enabling factor on all three levels, from individuals, through families, to society broadly. Information is created, shared, experienced and reused through technology, creating technology-augmented death practices. Literature focuses, in particular, on the design features and what they do for the dying and bereaved (Massimi & Charise,2009). There is a need however, for deeper interdisciplinary exploration of whether technology enables or hinders the grieving process and in what ways proactive design or more informed use of technology can help manage death experience. Today's generations are the first ever to inherit digital collections, and while this has changed what information about the dead is available in the future (Pitsillides,2016), inter-generational preservation is not yet well-supported by end-user systems"
"Today's generations are the first ever to inherit digital collections, and while this has changed what information about the dead is available in the future (Pitsillides,2016), inter-generational preservation is not yet well-supported by end-user systems (Doyle & Brubaker,2023). Also, although examinations of the role of AI have begun, there are numerous unanswered questions about thanatosensitive AI design and of incorporation of AI in the death industry. A question remains whether all technology and online spaces should be, by default, thanatosensitive.Philosophical and ethical issues of digital immortality and resurrection of data, although not the explicit focus of this review, have nonetheless emerged in many studies, and are the sole focus of a growing number of further works. What remains of a human, what does the digital afterlife mean for humankind, and what is sacred online? Notably, discussions about the obligations to preserve the data of the deceased tend to focus on social media platforms, but similar obligations may apply to families and public information institutions (likewise memory or heritage institutions, etc.), and remain to be examined. What must we do, what must we not do (e.g. with inherited information), and what are the limitations of our duties in cases of burdensome last wishes or neglected collections? These questions weave back to the decision-making one should consider in life- and death-related experiences. It is not just a question"
"information), and what are the limitations of our duties in cases of burdensome last wishes or neglected collections? These questions weave back to the decision-making one should consider in life- and death-related experiences. It is not just a question ofcanandshoulddigital afterlife exist, but also what responsibility we have toward sustainability. Literature warns against the unconscious and unending accumulation of digital data. How can we, and should we, delete data to prevent accidental accumulation and resource-intensive management of personal data? Perspectives that seem promising for helping to address these questions are information ethics (e.g. Floridi,2013), which we noted has been used to analyze digital immortality and second death, and ethics of care, which was recently proposed as a theoretical foundation for PIM (Cushing,2023).Finally, through addressing information management issues with lifeanddeath in mind, information science can promote death positivity in and to the benefit of society, help people prepare and have agency over how they and their data continue to exist in memory (of humans and technology), what legal implications their digital production may have, what remains as heritage. Important privacy issues can be dealt with proactively, such as preventing identity theft, cyber-attacks, and the creation and distribution of harmful content.

"privacy issues can be dealt with proactively, such as preventing identity theft, cyber-attacks, and the creation and distribution of harmful content. Death, like life, is an information phenomenon. Too complex of an issue to be solved just through one perspective, the death-and-information intersection reveals the need and potential for interdisciplinary collaboration of all affected and interested stakeholders.5 CONCLUSIONLike information and technology, death is an unavoidable and powerfully determining aspect of human lives. Aiming to understand research on death and information management, we conducted an extensive literature search and review of 293 scholarly publications, which we hope will serve as a helpful starting point for information scholars approaching this important conceptual intersection.We identified seven topics in the research, and reviewed each. The first covered works on information as a legacy, addressing practices and challenges in creating and inheriting digital legacies and the consideration of the value of such legacies for individuals, families and society. The following topic addressed information needs and information behaviors of the dying and bereaved and pointed out not just what needs people may have in this situation but also less explored aspects of information avoidance and the need to promote death positivity. The third topic explored intersections of information and data on the Internet in the context of death, especially how death is"
"may have in this situation but also less explored aspects of information avoidance and the need to promote death positivity. The third topic explored intersections of information and data on the Internet in the context of death, especially how death is becoming increasingly a social phenomenon and how social media and the Internet enable the resurgence of collective grieving, which differs from prevailing Western practices ofsequestration(Graham et al.,2015). Closely connected to changing practices online is the thanatosensitive design of technologies, presented in the fourth topic, that enhance death rituals, support the grieving process and enable people to prepare for their own death. Inevitably, ever-persisting data (intentional or not) poses the question of digital immortality and the digital afterlife of personal data and profiles. This issue was presented in the fifth topic. We concluded the review with two topics delving into ethical and legal dimensions of managing information and data after death and in the context of bereavement. Findings in these sections point to many still-existing uncertainties and a lack of clear policies to guide changing norms and behavior. In summary, our synthesis showed that information created and managed during someone's life has implications in several domains:How information represents the deceased individual, whether as a self-directed form of self-representation or as a portrayal through accidentally amassed information.How that"
"created and managed during someone's life has implications in several domains:How information represents the deceased individual, whether as a self-directed form of self-representation or as a portrayal through accidentally amassed information.How that information is used by the bereaved close contacts, legal inheritors, and other parties with commercial or societal interest in preserving and reusing personal data.How that information persists online (e.g. through footprints, memorials, or bots), creating digital afterlives and posing questions of immortality and resurrection.What is the responsibility of each interested stakeholder interacting with information in the context of death and how they approach, ethically use, legally define, sensitively design, culturally understand and manage information in a way that enhances the well-being of individuals and families and shapes future societal death rituals and grieving norms and behaviors.Understanding these perspectives was invaluable in showing that while there is growing awareness of the value and power information has, that awareness does not transpire at the individual level, and society is currently under-prepared for many emerging issues. Information essentially underpins the right to be remembered as well as the right to be forgotten, and this right extends from individuals to communities.

"underpins the right to be remembered as well as the right to be forgotten, and this right extends from individuals to communities. Information science has a lot of potential to contribute to this topic, but doing so requires more systematic and holistic research on information management, and the design of information services with death as well as life in mind is needed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors thank Helen Bubinger and Angel McNamara for their help collecting and organizing literature and Jed Brubaker and anonymous peer reviewers for their useful feedback.

"AbstractThis research reports on qualitative interviews with 31 participants who are Irish parents, identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer (LGBQ), and who expressed difficulty in the process of obtaining birth certificates for their children. Our aim was to use personal information management (PIM) and personal digital archiving (PDA) as a lens to explore the invisible work that the Irish government requires of a sexual minority parent group to obtain \"equal\" treatment in the birth registration and birth certificate process. Our findings suggest overlap with existing information behavior research (IB) that explore invisible information work, IB as a burden, information marginalization, information vulnerability, and information overload, and the everyday in IB. We propose a new framework: personal information burden (PIM-B) which is characterized by additional PIM activities, negative affect, lack of identity self extension to the personal information, and additional information seeking. We propose that a PIM-B may be used as an indicator of inequality in future research.1 INTRODUCTIONWhile the concept of personal information management (PIM) activities has largely been developed to improve tools and systems, there is less research and little theory to date that addresses PIM in general, especially outside of the work context (Dinneen & Julien,2020).

"less research and little theory to date that addresses PIM in general, especially outside of the work context (Dinneen & Julien,2020). As personal data and information continue to structure individuality and social systems, the need to manage this becomes more pertinent. Considering these issues, how can PIM be explored in a nonwork context in social systems, and how can findings be structured to support future investigations? We attempted to explore this through a study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer (LGBQ) parents' attempts to obtain birth certificates and/or other identity documents for their children in the Republic of Ireland.We aim to understand how PIM activities play a role in how LGBQ parents in Ireland experience inequality and discrimination via the additional personal information they are required to manage. Through exploring a sexual minority, a marginalized population, the authors attempt to stretch the context of previous PIM research. These parents associate with the gender binary but also represent a sexual minority. LGBQ are the dominant identity terms used in this article, as that is how the participants identified. None of these terms presuppose the existence of a clear group or identity, but they refer to some widely used discourses and categorizations. LGBQ is also used within the article to signal its common use as a term for sexual and gender minorities, while also not attempting to presume the sexual and gender intersection of anyone's identity"
"to some widely used discourses and categorizations. LGBQ is also used within the article to signal its common use as a term for sexual and gender minorities, while also not attempting to presume the sexual and gender intersection of anyone's identity (Dhoest et al.,2017).From the findings gathered through our research, we have developed a personal information management burden (PIM-B) as a conceptual tool that utilizes PIM to provide frameworks for understanding inequalities that occur when marginalized groups are burdened with disproportionate PIM activities in order to obtain and/or engage with necessary personal information due to government regulations. Additionally, we maintain that PIM-B can be generalizable as conceptual scaffolding and apparatus in understanding a host of additional PIM tasks in which a plethora of marginalized communities must engage when compared with mainstream, normative society.2 BACKGROUNDIn 2015, the Republic of Ireland voted by referendum for legal recognition of same sex marriage. Yet, the marriage equality referendum was limited to registration of marriage and did not extend recognition to same sex couples as parents. According to Dunne (2017) and Tobin (2016), this was largely a strategic choice to avoid discussion of LGBTQ intimacy in the debate about marriage equality.Ireland has attempted to update the birth registration and birth certificate process by developing additional pathways to parental recognition for some same sex couples,"
"choice to avoid discussion of LGBTQ intimacy in the debate about marriage equality.Ireland has attempted to update the birth registration and birth certificate process by developing additional pathways to parental recognition for some same sex couples, but as a result, these additional pathways change the PIM requirements for birth registration due to additional documentation required by the 2015 Parent and Child Relationship act (2015).The birth registration process largely rests on the ways in which the Irish State defines parentage. At the current time, the Irish Health Department (HSE) which issues birth certificates adopts the definition that the birth mother identifies as female, and is a biological female who gives birth to the child, regardless of genetic ties. The \"father\" identifies as male and is the biological male that is married to the \"mother.\" This leaves many parents in a state of limbo, particularly in cases of surrogacy, families consisting of two mother and/or two fathers, and nonbinary parents. Legal scholars debate whether this is an accurate reading of the law and there are court cases pending to challenge the HSE's definitions (Tobin,2017).While gender plays an important role in problems resulting from the Irish birth certificate, the focus of this study is the impact of the Irish birth certificate and birth registration process on LGBQ parents and how this leads to the exclusion of these parents on the Irish birth certificate. In 2020, the Irish"
"from the Irish birth certificate, the focus of this study is the impact of the Irish birth certificate and birth registration process on LGBQ parents and how this leads to the exclusion of these parents on the Irish birth certificate. In 2020, the Irish government began offering a pathway for families consisting of two females identifying as mothers, if the family met specific evidence requirements: conception as a result of ART in an Irish clinic after a specific date, evidence of maternity, evidence of cohabitation and/or marriage; and application to change the birth certificate fields after a \"standard\" (listing the fields of mother and father) birth certificate had been issued.The information fields on the current birth certificate registration form (https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/births-deaths-marriages/birth-registration-application-form.pdf) are listed as \"mother\" and \"father\" only; there is no allowance made for more than one mother, more than one father, more than two parents, or a parent that does not identify as a mother or a father (Department of Social Protection,2020). Additional pathways have been developed for children conceived from donor assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedure taking place after May 4, 2020 (the date when the 2015 Child and Family Relationship Act became law): same sex female couples must present consent forms and certificates from DAHR facilities to prove the serious nature of their relationship, as well as conception, and other"
"May 4, 2020 (the date when the 2015 Child and Family Relationship Act became law): same sex female couples must present consent forms and certificates from DAHR facilities to prove the serious nature of their relationship, as well as conception, and other declarations from the General Registration Office (the administrative unit that sits above a local Registry office). Irish law does not govern surrogacy and there is no provision made for two fathers in the 2015 Child and Family Relationships Act, or same sex female couples who conceive abroad which is common, due to high costs of ART in Ireland.3 LITERATURE REVIEW3.1Concepts of birth certificates and their structureBlyth et al. (2009) explored the historical intent of the birth certificate. The authors point out that a birth certificate is a single document that is asked to provide many functions: (1) provide details of the event of birth, (2) support an understanding of identity to the child, (3) act as a legally recognized identity document for the child, (4) list genetic information of the child, (5) act as evidence of legal parental rights that the parents hold, (6) provide evidence of citizenship and access to government entitlements and services, and (7) protect property rights and inheritance. It is also a document that contains personal information and should be protected by privacy laws and regulations.

"property rights and inheritance. It is also a document that contains personal information and should be protected by privacy laws and regulations. Noting this, the authors surmise that a new birth reporting format consisting of multiple certificates to address the many functions required might be useful in modern society, such as a \"certificate of parentage\" as well as a \"certificate of birth\" which separate the information to allow for different categories of parentage such as legal parentage, genetic parentage, and biological parentage. A version of this revised reporting format was also supported by Samuels (2018), Bainham (2008) and Quinn (2018). Maier (2019) has suggested a dynamic birth certificate format in which as many parents as necessary can select their own titles.Research about birth certificates tends to focus on the impact of the changes after the document is created, for example, Bainham's (2008) reference to the perceived lack of identity among donor conceived children. However, there is less known about the context of the birth certificatebeforethe document is created, such as the documentation requirements and information management that must happen before a State creates a birth certificate.3.2Personal information management and personal digital archivingBarreau (1995) defined a PIMsystemas \"an information system developed by or created for an individual for personal use in a work environment\" (p. 327).

"management and personal digital archivingBarreau (1995) defined a PIMsystemas \"an information system developed by or created for an individual for personal use in a work environment\" (p. 327). More recently, Jones,2008explained that information can be personal when it is \"owned by, about, directed toward, sent by, experienced by, or relevant to me\" (p. 33). Early PIM research included studies on how to improve office function (Lansdale,1988; Malone,1983). The research has largely been explored by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research and positioned as a lens to aid efforts to improve personal computing tools and systems.PIM is defined by the main activities of finding, keeping, mapping between need and information, and within that context are the \"meta level\" activities of organizing, maintaining, managing privacy, measuring, and evaluating, and making sense (Jones (2008).Naumer and Fisher (2007) state that \"Naturalistic inquiry may be used to study PIM in terms of everyday life behavior, thus broadening the scope of inquiry beyond workplace boundaries and toward understanding people's PIM behavior in the context of the entirety of their lives\" (p. 76).Bergman and Whittaker (2016) succinctly defined PIM as \"an activity in which an individual stores personal information items in order to retrieve them later.\" They differentiate PIM from other types of information management that involve engagement with public data, stating that PIM rests on the concept of personal"
"in which an individual stores personal information items in order to retrieve them later.\" They differentiate PIM from other types of information management that involve engagement with public data, stating that PIM rests on the concept of personal information curation, where an individual's concept of themselves plays a central role-this is how collection is made personal. They offer several examples that suggest that PIM exists in nonwork contexts and argue that personal information is distinct from \"public\" information, calling for a new field to focus on the unique nature of personal information in personal collections.Recent work has explored the more affective elements of PIM in contexts outside of professional paid work. Alon and Nachmias (2020) proposed a framework for affective interactions with personal information. In a review of existing literature, they identified seven affective aspects of PIM: anxiety, efficacy, frustration, desperation, belonging, dependence, and loss of control.Feng and Agosto (2019) recently explored the foundations of PIM in their exploration of personal activity tracking technology. The authors position the data produced by activity trackers as personal information, in efforts to update PIM theories. The authors position PIM as a subset of everyday life IB, linking the work with Savolainen's (1995,2007) ELIS theory, as well as Hartel (2010) and other's work on serious leisure.

"PIM theories. The authors position PIM as a subset of everyday life IB, linking the work with Savolainen's (1995,2007) ELIS theory, as well as Hartel (2010) and other's work on serious leisure. The authors found that Jones' (2008) six PIM activities still held true, but in the case of activity tracking technology, meta-level PIM activities were more important for users.Personal digital archiving (PDA) expands the PIM metalevel activity of maintaining (Cushing,2012,2013; Marshall,2008a,2008b; Marshall et al.,2006). In their systematic review of file management literature, Dinneen and Julien (2020) describe the relationship between PIM and PDA as having \"promising but so far largely implicit overlap\" (p. E18). Bass (2013) and Cushing (2010a,2010b) have also pointed out overlap between PIM and PDA. PDA focuses on user behavior with personal digital collections maintained over time and related factors of the maintaining behavior. It includes the characteristics of struggling to manage long-term access via distributed storage, benign neglect of personal digital collections, communicating with oneself (Marshall,2008a); providing evidence about the individual; representing one's identity via digital possessions, and a sense of \"bounded control\" over the collections (Cushing,2013).PIM and PDA tends to diverge in the relationship between research and tool and system development: PIM aligns more closely with the focus on systems, services, and tools as solutions, while PDA tends to"
"control\" over the collections (Cushing,2013).PIM and PDA tends to diverge in the relationship between research and tool and system development: PIM aligns more closely with the focus on systems, services, and tools as solutions, while PDA tends to focus more on information concepts, frameworks, and models, which aligns it with the aims of IB research. PDA can be viewed as a subarea of PIM research that attempts to stretch PIM to address conceptual aims often addressed in the realm of IB research.3.3Information behaviorSavolainen (1995,2007) introduced the concept that people search for information in informal, day to day contexts. Savolainen states that individuals engage in ELIS to obtain \"mastery of life,\" which is also described as \"a way of keeping things in order\" (Savolainen,1995, p. 259). This is very similar to Jones' (2008) definition of PIM. One cannot ignore similarities between the way that Savolainen positions the need to explore nonwork information seeking as everyday life information seeking, with how Bergman and Whittaker describe the need for a focus on behavior associated with the preservation and curation of personal information: both authors reflect on the plethora of existing research related to either work related studies (Savolainen) or public information behavior (Bergman and Whittaker) to paint a gap for the need to focus on PIM in nonwork environments.Examples of everyday life has been further explored in IB research including but not limited to"
"work related studies (Savolainen) or public information behavior (Bergman and Whittaker) to paint a gap for the need to focus on PIM in nonwork environments.Examples of everyday life has been further explored in IB research including but not limited to mothers pregnant with twins (McKenzie,2002), to immigrants (Caidi et al.,2010), urban teenagers (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell,2006), young parents seeking health information (Greyson (2017), and genealogists (Yakel,2004). According to Ocepek (2017) much of the IB research that explores the everyday lacks theoretical grounding and justification, resulting in research that is difficult to apply in contexts outside of the specific cases under investigation. Ocepek states that everyday IB is a rich environment to explore traditionally overlooked information issues and events by removing the boundaries between work and nonwork and urges researchers to seek theories outside of traditional IB to support investigations of the everyday life (p. 73).Of everyday IB explorations cited above, Greyson's (2017) exploration of young parents seeking health information stands out as particularly relevant to exploration of LGBQ parents' attempts to obtain birth certificates for their children in Ireland. Greyson (2017) situated young parents as a socially marginalized population because teenage pregnancy and parenting is considered \"risky\" and \"negative\" in contemporary Canadian culture.

"Greyson (2017) situated young parents as a socially marginalized population because teenage pregnancy and parenting is considered \"risky\" and \"negative\" in contemporary Canadian culture. In a context in which \"intensive mothering/parenting\" practices are valued and used as a measuring stick to assess fitness to parent, young parents were at a disadvantage due to their struggle to engage with the intensive mothering/parenting ideals. According to Greyson, this created a \"heavy load of information work placed on new parents by the ideology of intensive parenting\" (p. 794). Greyson also cited Chatman's (1996) concept of information poverty, linking information poverty with an everyday investigation. This \"heavy load\" of information is partially what was under investigation in the current study.Chatman's (1996) ethnographic work describes the difficulties that marginalized populations can experience when they engage in information behavior in their day to day lives. Chatman defines information poverty with the context of information world insiders and outsiders. Outsiders IB includes deception, risk taking, secrecy and situational relevance in the context of insiders and outsiders. In recognizing that one's information behavior can be related to one's association with a marginalized group, Chatman draws attention to the nature of the inequality between the information behavior of a marginalized social group, which was explored in this study. Chatman's theory of information"
"can be related to one's association with a marginalized group, Chatman draws attention to the nature of the inequality between the information behavior of a marginalized social group, which was explored in this study. Chatman's theory of information poverty has also been explored in many situations with examples including but not limited to the information world of female prisoners (Chatman,1999), the information world of the homeless (Hersberger,2002/2003), young men who have sex with other men (Veinot et al.,2013), and health information practices of the queer community (Wagner & Kitzie,2021). Haider and Bawden (2007) used discourse analysis to gain an understanding of how the concept of information poverty is described in LIS research. The authors found that research that utilizes the concept of information poverty was linked with economic determinism, interest in the digital divide and lack of information literacy, professional responsibility and moral obligations of LIS practitioners, and the roots of the public library in spreading literacy. The authors found that much of the discussion about information poverty suggests that information poverty is constructed based on \"lack\" which implies that there is a \"right kind as well as a right amount of information\" (p. 535).

"as well as a right amount of information\" (p. 535). This is further extended by Potnis and Winberry's (2021) concept of information vulnerability, which is defined as \"the lack of access to accurate, affordable, complete, relevant, and timely information or the inability to use such information, which can place individuals, communities or societies at disadvantage or hurt them\" (p. 1).Gibson and Martin (2019) are critical of Chatman's (1996) information poverty, pointing out that the work is heavily focused on the individual experiencing information poverty and their behaviors, and ignores the institutions that create the information poverty. They also point out that Chatman's work fails to address markers of identity that can contribute to information poverty, such as race and disability (Gibson & Martin,2019). Floegel and Costello (2019) also echo this criticism of Chatman (1996), finding that queer individuals can also experience information poverty based on their marginalized status.Gibson and Martin (2019) studied information poverty among a group of 24 mothers of individuals with down syndrome and ultimately proposed a theory of information marginalization, that describes \"the systematic, interactive socio-technical process that can push and hold certain groups of people at social margins where their needs are persistently ignored or overlooked\" (p. 476).

"process that can push and hold certain groups of people at social margins where their needs are persistently ignored or overlooked\" (p. 476). From their findings the participants experienced a burden in seeking, using, and obtaining information related to their marginalization. In contrast with Chatman's (1996) focus on \"the behavior of the marginalized\" the authors draw attention to \"the vehicles of marginalization\" (p. 477). The authors conclude by suggesting future work that examines \"the range of typical responses exhibited by people experiencing marginalization.\"Gibson and Martin (2019) found that within the information marginalization that their participants experienced, information overload was a specific issue that participants experienced at transition stages. The theory of information overload in information behavior is one of the most relevant in positioning information as a burden that individuals can experience, due to the state of feeling overwhelmed by information (Bawden et al.,1999). Bawden et al. (1999) found that information overload is also more likely to occur in institutions that involve a person faced with a diversity of information, but also the nature and amount of information required. In their study of information overload in telecom workplaces, Allan and Wilson (2003) defined information overload as:a perception on the part of the individuals (or observers of that person) that the flows of information associated with work tasks is greater than can"
"of information overload in telecom workplaces, Allan and Wilson (2003) defined information overload as:a perception on the part of the individuals (or observers of that person) that the flows of information associated with work tasks is greater than can be managed effectively, and a perception that overload in this sense creates a degree of stress for which his or her coping strategies are ineffective (p. 34).They found that shifts in role and increased task complexity was more likely to lead to feelings of information overload. Interestingly, they label the root cause of information overload as stress--the stress caused by modern management practices leads to defensive behavior and triggers feelings of overload.Goulding (2001) linked information poverty with information overload, suggesting that the impacts on individuals share the inability to act, which she describes as \"paralysis\" leading to \"information fatigue syndrome\" (p. 109). Savolainen (2007) describes information overload as being associated with feelings of \"being overwhelmed\" and insufficient time. Repeatedly, information overload is discussed as a problem associated with IB.Health information research specifically draws connections between the concept of a burden, stress, and IB. In her study of information work done by family caregivers of adults living with dementia, Dalmer (2020) contextualized how IB can be a burden: she found that in the review of existing literature, \"authors framed caregivers as being"
"stress, and IB. In her study of information work done by family caregivers of adults living with dementia, Dalmer (2020) contextualized how IB can be a burden: she found that in the review of existing literature, \"authors framed caregivers as being burdened due to lack of information\" (p. 681). Nursing research has also described information seeking as a burden for caregivers managing the chronic illnesses of loved ones (Kim,2020). In their study of the personal health information management of people managing chronic illnesses, Ancker et al. (2015) state that managing personal health information should be recognized as a burden that managing these illnesses places upon patients. In their findings, patients frequently describe the task of managing this information as invisible and a day-to-day struggle.Dalmer and Huvila (2019) echo this sentiment in their investigation of information work and the finding that this work is often invisible because it is commonplace. They call on information scholars to use information work as a lens to investigate the everyday, as focusing on information work can shed light on \"the invisibility of particular information activities and their constituents\" (p. 101). This is like Ocepek's (2017) call to remove the boundaries between work and nonwork to shed light on the everyday.3.4Gender, sexuality, and informationGender and sexuality have been a focus of research to some extent within IB, ELIS and broader information science research.

"call to remove the boundaries between work and nonwork to shed light on the everyday.3.4Gender, sexuality, and informationGender and sexuality have been a focus of research to some extent within IB, ELIS and broader information science research. ELIS has been noted as central in numerous contexts for the exploration of gender identities, such as: how ELIS can help inform an individual's formation and understanding of their gender identity (Levitt & Ippolito,2014, p. 8) and how social, cultural and formal gatekeepers affect the information seeking processes, particularly nonbinary and genderqueer people seeking information pertaining to their gender identity (Lu,2007, p. 115). Extending from gender, sexual minorities similarly have been a focus of much research, with an emphasis on information seeking practices around areas such sexual health (Bond et al.,2009; Flanders et al.,2017), sexual development (Hamer,2003; Nikkelen et al.,2019) and managing uncertainty on dating applications (Corriero & Tong,2015). IB research around sexual minorities has also been a focus, for LGBQ health information professionals (Morris & Roberto,2016).The ways in which information is transferred between LGBQ individuals and communities has also been a focus of research.

"been a focus of research. Cait McKinney's (2020) work on information activism examines how sexual minorities with precarious access to control over information create their own innovative resources for sharing knowledge within minority communities and beyond. Additionally, research has focused on discovering and exploring sexual identity through finding and seeking out individuals from the LGBQ community, which serves as a crucial mode of information transference for sexual minorities (Hardy,2019; Kerrigan & O'Brien,2020). The use of other LGBQ people as key information sources aligns with the concept of queer kinship, which is defined by Judith Butler as affective social structures that \"emerge to address fundamental forms of human dependency\" (Butler,2002, p. 15). Often, queer kinship occurs within the LGBQ community, since they are often at odds and in opposition to broader mainstream, heterosexual society. While the literature demonstrates some research pertaining to sexual minorities and information, there is minimal research pertaining to PIM. It is to this gap which the research speaks.4 METHODOur initial aim was to gather data from the lived experiences of a marginalized population (the sexual minority of LGBQ parents in Ireland) having trouble obtaining birth certificates for their children, to understand the PIM involved in these experiences.

In doing so, we wanted to explore Jones' (2008) PIM activities and Marshall's (2008a) and Cushing's (2013) PDA characteristics with the pre and post birth certificate context experienced by LGBQ parents in Ireland.Interviews were conducted via Zoom during April-May 2020. One author completed each interview, using the same list of questions. The calendar was split between the authors, with each author completing approximately half of the individual one on one interviews. After each interview was conducted, both authors met to discuss whether questions needed reframing. Participants were recruited using a purposive snowball sample of people who self-identified as LGBQ, who are currently in a same-sex relationship and who currently have children. Per our ethics approval, participants were not required to specifically explain their status as a member of the LGBQ group or to state their gender. The sample was collated initially through preliminary interviews with informants who were personal contacts and who openly identified as LGBQ. Thereafter, other potential participants were suggested by respondents, and these were subsequently pursued for further interviews.

"by respondents, and these were subsequently pursued for further interviews. While our initial sample included parents residing in Ireland, participant suggestions led us further afield, as we discovered many LGBQ parents, particularly gay men, had left Ireland purposely to have children outside of the State due to the restrictive legislation about birth certificates. As such, our participants included Irish citizens who were living abroad.This study utilizes a small sample and is limited to those identifying as LGBQ, a specific sexual minority that identifies with the gender binary. It should not be assumed that the participants in this study are representative of all LGBQ parents, and that findings can be transferred to other settings. Rather the study provides an example of PIM and IB in a specific context. Every effort was made to recruit an equal number of participants who identified as mothers and who identified as fathers, but it is estimated that far fewer gay fathers live in Ireland. The participants' lived experiences in this study are very much culturally centered in their experiences living in Ireland, and in Irish history and culture.A series of questions were designed for an interview schedule based on a preparatory literature review.

"literature review. Our literature review focused on how PIM/PDA has been used in nonwork contexts, information behavior research in nonwork context as well as for marginalized populations, the history of birth certificates and birth registration in Ireland and the UK, and how the birth certificate has been problematized in other contexts such as adoption and donor conception. The coauthors also brought their knowledge of previous research on sexual minorities in the Irish context (Kerrigan,2021; Kerrigan & O'Brien,2018,2020) and information seeking of donor conceived individuals (Clemens & Cushing,2010; Cushing,2010a,2010b). Both authors developed the interview schedule, which included questions designed to probe the experience of the participant in obtaining a birth certificate or citizenship for their child from Ireland, as well as the participant's understanding of the purpose the birth certificate and the information it should contain. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and de-identified. Confidentiality was assured, with any details that might reveal the identities of the participants changed. Interviews were conducted until saturation was observed.The interview data was analyzed using NVivo 12.

"between authors, the PI created a codebook for analysis initially from the interview guide for the first round of coding (deductive), and then added categories that emerged from interview data in round two of coding (inductive). The codebook was developed from the interview guide and preparatory literature review.Traditionally, PIM research has focused on empirical investigations to improve systems and tool development (Boardman & Sasse,2004). With our data analysis, our goal was to use the birth certificate as a gateway to understand the context in which the PIM and PDA is performed by a marginalized group (LGBQ parents in Ireland) in the context of this document. This includes the understanding that PDA includes the PIM meta-level activity of maintaining as Jones (2008) describes it: maintaining for now, maintaining for later, and maintaining for our lives and beyond-which bridges PIM and PDA. As Naumer and Fisher (2007) suggest, we sought to decouple our exploration of PIM from seeking user behavior to improve a system or tool, and instead focus on the \"factors determining the behavior\" as Dinneen and Julien (2020) describe in their study of file management and PIM.While the status of LGBQ parents in Ireland as a sexual minority and marginalized group associated this study with IB research, specifically theories of information poverty and everyday life IB, our analysis was exploratory and did not seek to assess specific theories of information behavior. However, as the"
"minority and marginalized group associated this study with IB research, specifically theories of information poverty and everyday life IB, our analysis was exploratory and did not seek to assess specific theories of information behavior. However, as the literature review demonstrates, several concepts within the umbrella of ELIS and information poverty were particularly relevant including the concepts of invisible work and information as a burden, information overload, and information marginalization, which we further elaborate on in findings Table2.During the axial coding process, the first author used memoing to sort through thoughts and ideas. It is within memos that the first author first identified the concept of a PIM burden. The initial NVivo memo detailed the potential for an \"information seeking burden\" in comparison with the way that participants in Cushing (2010a,2010b) described the affective features of their search for information about their anonymous sperm donors genetic fathers. Upon refining, it was clear that the burden was not so much related to seeking information but organizing and providing documentation as a means to justify recognition of the LGBQ individuals' status as parents and the rights that accompany that status via the birth certificate.5 FINDINGSIn total, 31 people participated in an interview (see Table1).

It's actually that easy to put a man on the birth certificate and there's no need to prove it, there's no DNA test, there's nothing.

The idea of going to register the birth of your child is one of the things you will always remember, besides the actual birth. But the day of going to register the birth, is usually such a special day. Obviously in our case and in the case of most LGBQ parents, it's really a devastating day because you have to go and register as a single parent. (Participant 1)... I'm the only parent, because on the other side [...] of the birth certificate is blank [...] Even just looking at that visual, I remember the day I got it and I just found it, it was gut-wrenching [...] And some people might say it was only a piece of paper, but it isn't [...] it feels a lot more than that, especially"

So, like even though, and I think what I've learned now is like, your birth certificate means a lot, but then it doesn't mean much at all because our kids have a birth certificate where both of us are identified as our children's parents, but when we move home [to Ireland] I will no longer be recognized as a parent to my children. (Participant 17)When I had to go and get [the birth certificate] for [our son] and I had to register him, it changed quite a bit because I had to deny my current status completely.

This work included finding information required to obtain a birth certificate, making sense of the procedure and rules as well as the laws in different jurisdictions, weighing their options for the birth to take place in different jurisdictions, maintaining information about conception, and managing interactions with government officials.

"information about conception, and managing interactions with government officials. In their view, the birth certificate is a government entitlement which heterosexual families were able to access with ease-they simply did not have to think about these issues.Additional information management work was needed \"post-birth certificate\" which was centered around the passport and social welfare benefits, among gay fathers (in Ireland, a birth certificate is required for access to a passport and social welfare). In one case, a gay father described his experience of attempting to obtain a birth certificate as so difficult, he and his husband drove their surrogate over the Irish border to Northern Ireland, so their child would be born in the UK and subject to UK jurisdiction for obtaining a birth certificate.Many of the participants also explained their experiences of dealing with the birth certificate as \"jumping through hoops,\" which compounded the recognition of engagement in additional PIM tasks. This demonstrates that the participants engaged in Jones (2008) PIM tasks such as finding, keeping, organizing, and mapping between information and need, but also maintaining in the long-term using distributed systems (PDA), which acted like a burden.

"like a burden. Documents were maintained, organized, collected, and shared with different parties to evidence marriage, cohabitation, conception, and identity. In contrast, a heterosexual couple need only to supply documents to evidence identity. In some cases, gay fathers had to supply evidence of paternity via document detailing an official DNA test and write letters to different government officials to petition for child benefit. In contrast, mothers simply apply for child benefit allowance using an online portal.Participants described the information management, and experiences with government officials during the information management as unfair, as invisible work, and as a heavy burden. These feelings are like those found by IB researchers who have explored personal health information management (Ancker et al.,2015) invisible work (Dalmer & Huvila,2019), the lack of information as a burden (Dalmer,2020), and IB of marginalized groups (Floegel & Costello 2019; Gibson & Martin,2019; Greyson,2017). While information about conception can be considered health information, the addition of identity documents such as a marriage certificate, as well as a passport or driver's license to evidence identity, and informal documents to evidence cohabitation add complexity to the PIM, by requiring different types of information.

(1999) who link information overload in cases where there is increasing diversity of information. In the case of parents caring for children with autism and down syndrome, Gibson and Martin (2019) found information overload to occur during transitions. In contrast, our participants' discussion of feeling burdened and overloaded was more likely to occur during interactions with officials at the ART clinic or government departments.The PIM work felt invisible for participants because it required more labor than was required for heterosexual couples, it was government mandated, and there was a sense that the general public had no understanding of the additional work taking place. Participants reported that when explaining their plight to family and friends, most people thought that the 2015 Marriage Referendum addressed all issues relating to LGBQ inequality in Ireland, when in fact, it only addressed marriage equality. In discussing government delivery of digital health information, Dalmer and Huvila (2019) describe the \"good patient\" discourse which requires patients to engage in \"complex, emotional, and time-consuming work\" to manage health information (p. 101). For LGBQ parents, the invisible work required by the Irish government to avail of \"equality\" for their children (in the form of a birth certificate that recognizes two mothers) is"
