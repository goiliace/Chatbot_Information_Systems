"the maturity concerns for the selected Nigerian MDAs. The issues that affect MIS maturity in Nigerian MDAs are related to: (1) integration of MIS initiatives, creating MIS vision, implementation of MIS management policies and the development of supportive MIS objectives which influence MIS maturity, (2) robust MIS objectives and robust MIS management that influences service delivery.1 INTRODUCTIONNigerian Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are referred to as the Public Business Organizations (PBOs) and it can improve their efficiency by implementing Management Information System (MIS) technology, which can be classed as rudimentary, moderate, or advanced (Agboola,2014; Oladele,2008). Every PBO's MIS has a significant impact on its essential functions and activities. Installing and implementing simple MIS technology is usually less expensive than installing and implementing more advanced MIS devices. As a result, the type of MIS technology employed by PBOs can have a significant impact on operating costs (human capital, training, development, and security), as well as the output quality (i.e., effective and efficient service delivery), as well as the number of people and the time it takes to complete the PBO's administrative and service duties (Agboola,2014; Khudhur,2017; Munirat et al.,2014).The scientific reassessment of communication and information causes a wide-ranging change in life and business, affecting how governments deliver services to their citizens."
"and service duties (Agboola,2014; Khudhur,2017; Munirat et al.,2014).The scientific reassessment of communication and information causes a wide-ranging change in life and business, affecting how governments deliver services to their citizens. Which also has an impact on the nations' future? Governments are moving to electronic governments as new technology helps to decrease managerial and human costs while also making work more accurate and faster. The goal of a MIS is to manage data, organize information, and retrieve it so that the firm may provide services faster and market more accurately and easily, which affects the degree of performance (Al-Gharaibeh & Malkawi,2013; Aramide et al.,2020; Ominunu,2015).In Nigeria, the function of MIS has expanded over time to become a vital element of its commercial processes. Information systems (IS) have become more widely used in the previous 20 years, not just by businesses, but also by individuals and governments. The creation of competitive digital enterprises was aided by technological breakthroughs, including advancements in telecommunications such as the internet, globalization that created a global unrestricted marketplace, significant growth for the information economy, and the use of ISs. All of these have shifted the focus of ISs from data processing to decision support, laying the groundwork for the new business environment (Ijeoma,2018; Mishra et al.,2015; Munirat et al.,2014).The biggest obstacles associated with the"
"the use of ISs. All of these have shifted the focus of ISs from data processing to decision support, laying the groundwork for the new business environment (Ijeoma,2018; Mishra et al.,2015; Munirat et al.,2014).The biggest obstacles associated with the implementation of MIS, according to Helo et al. (2008) and Seo (2013), are not technically related issues such as complexity, high settings, and compatibility. Most issues arise from within the organization and are human in nature (e.g., fighting change, management decisions, project mishandling and others). Many variables, including some of the issues raised during the deployment of MIS, make it difficult for Nigerian Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to reach the required levels of maturity that similar institutions in other developing nations have achieved. According to Otukoya (2014), the largest difficulty facing MDAs in Nigeria is the country's low level of development. Some of these issues could be linked to a lack of information in technology advancement, which has been described as a global economic engine (Gakuubi,2018; Obasan & Soyebo,2012; Oladele,2008; Olanrewaju,2016).Gwang (2011) emphasized the importance of providing library and MIS services in a company. As a result, the ability of Nigerian government personnel to access and use MIS is critical, as it would enable the country to maintain its position as Africa's giant and, ultimately, contribute to Nigeria's national objective of being among the"
"company. As a result, the ability of Nigerian government personnel to access and use MIS is critical, as it would enable the country to maintain its position as Africa's giant and, ultimately, contribute to Nigeria's national objective of being among the 20-principal world financial powers by 2025. Several research, such as Boudreau et al. (2008) and Elliot (2011), have begun to investigate the field of Sustainability Supply Chain Management Information System (SSCMIS), and, in the process, initiating debates about MIS/critical IT's role in the deployment of SSCMIS apps and projects. There appears to be a general lack of understanding of the existence of a MIS maturity framework that is specifically designed for exhibiting MIS operations of firms and aligning them with SSCMIS application (Dike,2007; Ogunsola,2005; Peng et al.,2021).The quest of existence, worldwide relevance, maintaining existing market share, and sustainable development has had a significant impact on the multiple benefits of IT, which would be of tremendous benefit to Nigerian MDAs if advanced automated equipment were used. MDAs have recently made attempts to create the necessary MIS Software to improve sustainability within its organizations. Though, research efforts focused on this specific component are scarce. However, the researcher's goal in this study is to assess MDAs' reactions to this new movement by examining the extent to which MDAs have used MIS novel technologies in their operations and the"
"efforts focused on this specific component are scarce. However, the researcher's goal in this study is to assess MDAs' reactions to this new movement by examining the extent to which MDAs have used MIS novel technologies in their operations and the impact that these technologies have had. The aim of this research is to investigate the MIS maturity concerns for technology advancement in Nigerian PBOs, and a maturity model for Nigerian MDAs was recommended based on the outcomes of the study, which included varied perspectives from respondents on MIS maturity problems.2 LITERATURE REVIEWIT has brought about significant changes, changing how Public Business Organizations (PBOs) are established and enterprises are handled on daily basis. Information technology is constantly evolving, breaking down new barriers, opening new possibilities, and defining new dimensions of human existence. Information technology can also be defined as a systematic set of tools, procedures, and configurations for creating, collecting, storing, processing, controlling, and manipulating information and data. During the 1950s and 1960s, commercial data was managed using perforated card equipment, electronic secretarial machines, and massive mainframe computers with much lower capabilities than today's computers (Laudon & Laudon,2015). The electronic data processing (EDP) department oversaw information processing at the time. The 1970s saw the birth of the first multi-user networks, when stations were"
"computers with much lower capabilities than today's computers (Laudon & Laudon,2015). The electronic data processing (EDP) department oversaw information processing at the time. The 1970s saw the birth of the first multi-user networks, when stations were linked to enormous mainframe computers (Laudon & Laudon,2015). The private enterprises (banking, insurance, and investment organizations) of the 21st century operate in a diverse and highly dynamic business environment characterized by changes brought about by technological advancements and extraordinarily turbulent financial weather. IT, on the other hand, is at the heart of this global transformation agenda. Managers cannot afford to overlook IS because it is so important in today's business organizations (Liu & Arnett,2000; Zhang et al.,2005).2.1 Management information system (MIS) and information technology (IT)Daneshvar Kakhki and Gargeya (2019) described MIS and IT as two critical tools for the successful operation of PBOs, and despite their distinct functions, both ideas are intertwined. To support Palvia et al. (2015) claim, IT is essentially the gathering, storage, operation, and transfer of information. This can be defined as the computerization of numerous operations, as well as the alteration and production of information using computer software and ancillary equipment like as credit cards and automated teller machines (ATM).

"as well as the alteration and production of information using computer software and ancillary equipment like as credit cards and automated teller machines (ATM). IT is a term that refers to the application of electronic technology in all aspects of our lives. IT refers to the outcomes, inventions, approaches, and standards employed in the creation of information (Benitez et al.,2018).As defined by Daneshvar Kakhki and Gargeya (2019), information processing is the preparation, collection, conveyance, recovery, storage, admission, appearance, and revolution of information in all of its forms (text, picture, voice, video, and graphics). Data exchange can occur between humans, between humans and machines, and/or between technology. Information management ensures that IT assets are collected, distributed, managed, operated, preserved, and progressed in accordance with company goals and objectives. The term IT refers to the outcomes, methodologies, discoveries, and ideals that are used to create data, whereas MIS refers to the IT infrastructure, its application systems, and the personnel who service IT to provide data and communication services for business processing and PBO management (Elpez & Fink,2006; Ijeoma,2018).Kornkaew (2012) described MIS as a collection of components that interact to produce information, including hardware, software, data, procedures, and people.

"(2012) described MIS as a collection of components that interact to produce information, including hardware, software, data, procedures, and people. Supercomputers, keyboards, memory disks, and communication devices are examples of hardware, whereas word-processing programs are examples of software. Texts, sentences, words, and graphic information are all examples of data. The processes are referred to as the way in which the package and its sophisticated functionalities are utilized. Meanwhile, the last factor on the list is people. The most important function of all is that MIS involves not only the visible supercomputers, packages, and messaging devices, but also the assembly of the hardware, installation of software, data, procedures, and people. IT hardware and software play an important role in MIS. However, IT has recently emerged as an emerging key aspect in PBO strategic planning. Furthermore, IT acts as a resource upon which PBOs policies in MIS are formed (Daneshvar Kakhki & Gargeya,2019). Based on the findings of Liu and Arnett (2000) the primary job of IT is to be an enabler, a creator, and a facilitator. An inventor's primary goal in an IT setting is to initiate a new method or introduce an IT variation. A gadget that aids in the management of work is referred to as an IT facilitator (i.e., work done with ease). An IT enabler gives the ability or adequate support to achieve PBO goals.2.2 Management information systems and PBO aims and purposesThe three main"
"gadget that aids in the management of work is referred to as an IT facilitator (i.e., work done with ease). An IT enabler gives the ability or adequate support to achieve PBO goals.2.2 Management information systems and PBO aims and purposesThe three main components of the MIS are growth and utilization, information systems, and business goals and objectives. Zhang et al. (2005) define MIS as a computer-based organizational information system. The aspects of MIS that are considered crucial determinants for its effectiveness are to report static and standard information and to produce reports. MIS installation requires MIS people, which comprise analysts and computer scientists from organizations, to receive official requests from users and to supply arranged and necessary outputs. Ada and Ghaffarzadeh (2015) stated that MIS also makes use of external data that the organization does not collect in the system. Asemi et al. (2011), on the other hand, claim that the roles of MIS are a beneficial instrument for public business decisions through information gathering from the MIS system. The notion is primarily focused with converting information into data in order to make appropriate decisions. Al-Okaily et al. (2020) focused on private corporate organizations, advocating that MIS analyses performance based on the economic efficiency of hardware and software.According to Beaumaster (2002) and cited by Benitez et al. (2018), PBOs assess cost efficiency of goods in decision making"
"private corporate organizations, advocating that MIS analyses performance based on the economic efficiency of hardware and software.According to Beaumaster (2002) and cited by Benitez et al. (2018), PBOs assess cost efficiency of goods in decision making but must also meet other equally essential hard norms such as procedural equity. The management information system (MIS) is focused on the computerization of numerous corporate activities with the purpose of offering improved ways of preparation, writing, and process control. According to Hashim (2010), MIS is sometimes referred to as an IS that provides strategies to manage problems and issues related to all aspects of information management in PBOs. Finally, MIS serves as a facilitator for PBOs, which aid in organizational actions. MIS implementation is expensive due to expensive assets; project execution necessitates comprehensive planning of its strategy, implementation, and operational processes; specifically, its obstacles and implications for maturity concerns in Nigerian MDAs. To address the maturity concerns of the Nigerian MDAs, there is need to propose a model that will support MIS maturity sustainability.2.3 IT maturity modelWhen utilized in an organizational setting, the maturity model is always measured in terms of progress.

"the maturity model is always measured in terms of progress. The model presented here claims that an organization will progress through numerous distinct and sequential stages. Each level represents a distinct state of maturity in the organization's use and management of MIS. The Maturity model is an effective tool for distinguishing between MIS operations and management in MDAs. According to Carcary (2013), the literature describes numerous MIS risk management strategies, procedures, and frameworks. The previous review demonstrates some development in thought around the most effective risk management approaches. Siponen (2002) developed the term \"software maturity criteria\" to describe how maturity standards represent progress in information security management in PBOs. Whereas Becker et al. (2010) proposed that maturity models are theoretical frameworks that indicate usual, rational, predicted, and desired progress paths toward maturity, Rosemann and De Bruin (2005) believe that maturity is a degree of evaluating PBO competencies in a specific area. Despite this, numerous novel maturity concepts have been developed in recent years. As previously reported by Luftman (2003), Rosemann and De Bruin (2005), and Khaiata and Zualkernan (2009), the majority of the new maturity concepts are aimed at illuminating MIS maturity in: MIS/IS/IT/business configuration; business process management; and business intelligence (Hewlett Packard,2007); project management (Crawford,2006); data"
"(2009), the majority of the new maturity concepts are aimed at illuminating MIS maturity in: MIS/IS/IT/business configuration; business process management; and business intelligence (Hewlett Packard,2007); project management (Crawford,2006); data lifecycle management (Gmelin & Seuring,2014); digital government (Gottschalk,2009); inter-organizational systems adoption (Kurnia et al.,2019); and enterprise resource planning system use (Holland & Light,2001). This study would explore the challenges of MIS maturity in Nigerian MDAs. Factors contributing to the MDAs maturity level will be measured in terms of vision and plan, process, people, and Infrastructure. Furthermore, the model will contain empirical piloting, testing, and validation of the model, as well as advancement of various enhancing methods, outcomes, and metrics to advance the maturity level.3 METHODOLOGY3.1 Study designThe study's statistical approach and techniques used are the foundation for carrying out quantitative research. The empirical portion of this study aims to look at MIS maturity problems among Nigerian MDAs. For the SSCMIS model in Nigerian MDAs, the researcher wants to report on the maturity problems of the MIS maturity framework and technological improvement.

"The MIS maturity concept is based on past Software Capability Maturity (SCM) and MIS/IS/IT governance/planning assessments, and it will be specially tailored for the SSCMIS concept based on related perspectives from earlier interviews done with various public business enterprises. Questionnaire was the primary tool utilized to collect data for this study. The survey was divided into two sections; section 1 includes questions related to personal details of respondents such as age, gender, qualification, managerial level, and years of experience in the MDA, while the second section include questions related to other variables in the theoretical model. Each of the indicators is measured using a Likert scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least and 5 being the highest. The instrument used in this study is included in theAppendix A. Five Nigerian MDAs were chosen at a purposive sampling from a total of twenty-five (25) departments at the federal government. Neuman (2006) recommendations were followed in making study design decisions. The sample size is restricted to senior MIS/IT managers and functional managers of Nigerian MDAs to have a better understanding of the research topic from the perspective of practitioners and the reasons for adopting such a viewpoint. One hundred and twenty (120) questionnaires were sent out, with a total of one hundred and nine (109) responses.

"reasons for adopting such a viewpoint. One hundred and twenty (120) questionnaires were sent out, with a total of one hundred and nine (109) responses. The intended sample size was 120, which was calculated by selecting the minimum acceptable size of a demographic subgroup with a 5% margin of error and a 95% confidence level (Israel,1992). PBOs in the federal capital territory at Abuja were included in the survey. Purposive (judgmental) sampling was used to acquire the data, which is appropriate when individuals with particular attributes are desired (Neuman,2006).3.2 Statistical analysisThe survey data was entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which was then exported to IBM SPSS (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences) version 24 for analysis. The data was organized using descriptive statistics and inferential numbers. All constructs exhibited reliabilities greater than 0.8, which, according to Manerikar and Manerikar (2015), is considered satisfactory. The instrument had an overall reliability of 0.959, which means that the acceptable level is \"good,\" implying that the instrument is trustworthy. To limit the data to a smaller set that is all connected to each other, a factor analysis was used. Finally, the data was subjected to inferential statistical analysis, which included independent T-tests, analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation coefficients.

"data was subjected to inferential statistical analysis, which included independent T-tests, analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation coefficients. The model proposed in this study is discussed in the section below.3.3 Development of a proposed MIS maturity modelThe suggested MIS Maturity model was based on an existing maturity framework; however, it was tailored to the implementation of SSCMIS in Nigerian MDAs. A systemic approach was used, as well as design science. The model's objective and target group were determined while it was being developed. A comparison with the existing model was made to see where the parallels were and how a new method could be used to develop a strategy. The model's goal is to assist Nigerian MDAs in reaching a sustainable level of ICT adoption. The model is designed to track the progress of MIS development so that SSCMIS practices may be implemented. The Maturity Model presented in this document is intended for a specific audience, such as IT managers and other department heads. In order for the Nigerian MDAs to accept this model, it will be evaluated by more than one individual for reliability, validity, and generality (Peng et al.,2021; Rahim et al.,2014).3.4 Dimensions of the proposed MIS maturity modelThe four primary dimensions of the MIS maturity model for Nigerian MDAs are MIS vision and plan, MIS process, MIS people, and MIS infrastructure.

"MIS maturity modelThe four primary dimensions of the MIS maturity model for Nigerian MDAs are MIS vision and plan, MIS process, MIS people, and MIS infrastructure. These elements are based on two existing studies: supply chain management and IT strategy and governance by Rahim et al. (2014). Four distinct MIS Maturity Stages are explained using MIS techniques. The dimensions and their relationships are shown in FigureB1(Appendix B).The model resembles a triangular pyramid with a base that meets at a position above the base, as shown in FigureB1(Appendix B). (i.e., the apex). The apex (D1) is the central point of the triangle, where all the pillars meet. The D1 (MIS Vision and Plan) initiates and enhances the actions of the three dimensions being specified by the pointers.3.5 The proposed MIS maturity model for the implementation of SSCMIS in Nigerian MDAsAs stated in TableB1(Appendix B), the suggested MIS maturity model is intended as an SSCMIS framework for use in Nigerian MDAs. The proposed approach is intended to help improve the configuration between the company's MIS activities and its sustainability functions, which oversee SSCMIS practices and objectives. The researcher recommends that PBOs take measures toward achieving MIS maturity for successful implementation and services of each SSCMIS idea and observation for efficient and resourceful service delivery when discussing the model.The TableB1(Appendix B) shows the various measuring factors for the maturity model."
"MIS maturity for successful implementation and services of each SSCMIS idea and observation for efficient and resourceful service delivery when discussing the model.The TableB1(Appendix B) shows the various measuring factors for the maturity model. The MIS vision and plan dimension has four (4) indicators, MIS process has three (3) indicators, MIS people dimension has six (6) indicators while the MIS Infrastructure has four indicators too.3.6 Exploratory factor analysisThe study employed covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling to investigate the fitness of the model and the correlations between the variables based on answers from 109 MDAs. Sample size affects parameter estimations and chi-square tests of fit. As a result, Structural Equation Modeling is a method for large samples according to Kline (2015). In exploratory factor analysis models, Velicer and Fava (1998) and MacCallum et al. (2001) discovered that the magnitude of the factor loadings, the number of variables, and the size of the sample were critical factors in obtaining a decent factor model (Ullman & Bentler,2012). The validity of the instrument was assessed using exploratory factor analysis with a principal component approach and a varimax rotation. The goal of the factor analysis was to see if the constructions on instructions on management information system maturity concern evaluation could be loaded on four different factors (i.e., vision and plan, process, people and infrastructure and"
"rotation. The goal of the factor analysis was to see if the constructions on instructions on management information system maturity concern evaluation could be loaded on four different factors (i.e., vision and plan, process, people and infrastructure and applications). In addition, a factor analysis was performed to see if the management information system maturity concern for service delivery could be divided into two variables (technology maturity and maturity service), as shown in TableB2(Appendix B).The eigenvalue of the first factor was found to be 2.744, accounting for 8.30 percent of the overall variance. This factor consists of two infrastructure and application-related components and three people-related items. The factors involving the use of MIS applications to support initiatives, the existence of formality in regulating interactions between MIS managers and SSCMIS managers, internal integration between MIS practices that are designed to suit SSCMIS initiatives, providing opportunities for MIS managers to understand the sustainability requirements of SSCMIS managers, and MIS manager training. The element was given a name \"Integration of MIS initiatives.\"The eigenvalue of the second factor was 2.1158, and it accounted for 14.39% of the overall discrepancy.

The element was given a name \"Creating MIS vision.\"With an eigenvalue of 2.111, the third factor accounted for 14.07 percent of the overall variation. There were two remarks about infrastructure and applications and two factors were mentioned about people in it. TableB2(Appendix B) stated that the infrastructures used for MIS applications have an appropriate maintenance monitoring system in place, with regular update checks on the infrastructure that support SSCMIS initiatives are in place, MIS people are officially assigned to specific MIS procedures for assisting SSCMIS, and that the relationship between MIS managers and SSCMIS managers in the sector is constructive. The factor was named \"Implementation of MIS Management policies.\"The fourth component, which included three of the vision and strategy items, had an eigen-value of 2.086, accounting for 13.91 percent of the variation.

The factor was named \"Development of Supportive MIS objectives.\"3.6.1 Assessing validity on management information system maturity concern for service deliveryThe KMO was 0.819, indicating that the correlations were suitable for factor analysis because they were more than 0.5. The null hypothesis of a lack of sufficient correlations was rejected by the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity, which had a chi-square value of 333.071 and a p-value of less than 0.001. Most communalities were more than 0.5, resulting in a two-factor solution, as shown in TableB3(Appendix B).With an eigenvalue of 3.794, the first factor accounted for 37.94 percent of the total variation. It included most of the five technology maturity elements, as well as three maturity service statements, including regular training for maturing MIS and for service delivery, as well as adequate procedures for external integration between departments to enable service delivery. Finally, methods for developing internal MIS integration for optimal service delivery are in place.

"Finally, methods for developing internal MIS integration for optimal service delivery are in place. The element was given a name \"Robust MIS Objectives.\"The eigenvalue of the second factor was 1.515, and it accounted for 15.15 percent of the total variance. The factor was made up of the two remaining items on the maturity service, namely the necessity for a system upgrade to increase service delivery and how database application advancement has impacted service delivery in each department. The element was given a name \"Robust MIS Management.\"4 RESULT AND DISCUSSIONFor many decades, the issue of connecting IS/IT with business divisions has been recognized (Luftman & Kempaiah,2007; Ravichandran et al.,2005; Sabherwal & Chan,2001). Many organizations have established a separate section to deal with sustainability issues as they have recognized the necessity of sustainability measures. The four constructs, which were used to measure MIS maturity concerns in this study are: MIS maturity concerns on vision and plan; MIS maturity concerns on process; MIS maturity concerns on people; and MIS maturity concerns on infrastructure and applications.4.1 Descriptive statistics on instruction on MIS maturity concernsIt can be shown that many respondents agreed with the MIS maturity concern on all the criteria stated on vision and plan.All the claims about MIS processes are agreed upon by respondents, apart from the statement about MIS process adoption being influenced by management, which"
"respondents agreed with the MIS maturity concern on all the criteria stated on vision and plan.All the claims about MIS processes are agreed upon by respondents, apart from the statement about MIS process adoption being influenced by management, which is undetermined. Respondents are unsure about the quality metrics that should be used in MIS procedures for Nigerian MDAs.The responses reveal that Nigerian MDAs have personnel who work well together as MIS and SSCMIS managers in their respective areas. Procedures to govern connections between MIS and SSCMIS managers, on the other hand, are yet to be defined.Most respondents believe that infrastructure and application statements are a MIS maturity concern. Most respondents agree with the emotions conveyed in this paper that the descriptions of infrastructure and application in use raise concerns.4.2 Descriptive statistics on management information system maturity for service deliveryThe effects of MIS maturity concern of technology advancement (i.e., computer and office automation) and MIS maturity concern of how information systems were used to gauge management information system maturity for service delivery.

"deliver better results. However, external integration between inter-sectoral MIS technology devices that increase government employee service delivery must be improved.The MIS maturity of Nigerian MDAs is impacted significantly by MIS maturity and service delivery. Integration of MIS projects, creation of MIS vision, execution of MIS management policies, and establishment of supportive MIS objectives are all elements that significantly influence MIS maturity which also have overall impact on the Nigerian MDAs MIS maturity. Robust MIS objectives and MIS management practices have substantial impact on service delivery and then the MIS Maturity of MDAs are affected by the impact of service delivery. Thus, the stated factors significantly result in the overall MIS maturity of the Nigerian MDAs. The model's graphical representation is given in FigureB2(Appendix B) by the correlation of the constructs.Some of the factors that affect the maturity of Nigerian public sectors have surfaced because of this study's examination (i.e., vision and plan, process, people, and infrastructure). The MIS maturity is influenced by the creation of a MIS vision, the formulation of supportive MIS objectives, the integration of MIS projects, and the application of MIS management policies, according to exploratory factor analysis.

"application of MIS management policies, according to exploratory factor analysis. In the graphic above, MIS maturity concerns in the Nigerian public sector are examined. Through their vision, process, people, and infrastructure, this report was able to uncover MIS maturity concerns in the Nigerian public sector. Moreover, Robust MIS objectives and Robust MIS Management also significantly influenced the service delivery in Nigerian public sectors. Therefore, the novelty of this study is to help in identifying factors influencing MIS maturity. This study will help IT managers and policymakers in public organizations to identify the maturity level of each organization and steps to take in advancing the maturity level of each organization. The MIS vision and plan, MIS process, MIS people and MIS infrastructure must align for the maturity of the MIS maturity in all public organizations.Despite the value of the IT Maturity Model for MDAs, we acknowledge some management problems that organizations may face if they follow the roadmap outlined in our model. The first challenge is a lack of strategic sponsorship. The senior corporate management being hesitant to support the adoption of the strategy described in this study. This might happen when management pursues only superficial compliance with SSCMIS methods and concepts in their supply chain operations. As a result, management is oblivious to the necessity to change their current IT preparedness and strategy for the SSCMIS"
"might happen when management pursues only superficial compliance with SSCMIS methods and concepts in their supply chain operations. As a result, management is oblivious to the necessity to change their current IT preparedness and strategy for the SSCMIS context.Challenge 2 is the Lack of Managerial Understanding of MIS: Many managers are unaware of the potential benefits, as well as the socio-political and legal obligations of their organizations to implement sustainability practices in general, and the application of those practices within their supply chain operations. As a result, they frequently display less interest in fine-tuning their corporate IT vision and strategy to assist MIS projects. Managers may be more ready to allocate their IT resources and investment to other business priorities than to accept the model's proposals. This situation may worsen if senior management fails to recognize the strategic value of sustainable initiatives.Challenge 3 is the Interactions gap: IT managers and business managers that are implementing sustainable practices with their supply chain partners frequently utilize jargons (technical/business) that are common in their respective fields. IT managers are less familiar with sustainability ideas, while sustainability managers may lack a clear understanding of how IT may be leveraged more effectively to support their MIS maturity. This may lead to misunderstandings, which may impede the incorporation of the concepts presented in our"
"ideas, while sustainability managers may lack a clear understanding of how IT may be leveraged more effectively to support their MIS maturity. This may lead to misunderstandings, which may impede the incorporation of the concepts presented in our proposed maturity model into organizational environments. A strong executive support, on the other hand, would encourage both the IT and sustainability teams to work closely together to help adopt SSCMIS principles; this may occur when senior corporate leadership establishes and openly supports their organizations' sustainability ambitions.Challenge 4 is the Lack of proper ICT infrastructure: Some organizations' current ICT infrastructure may not be adequate to assist IT management in implementing MIS procedures. It is possible that further cash will be required. Securing funds and pooling collaborative resources from supply chain partners to help implement MIS initiatives is a politically delicate issue that is far from simple.5 CONCLUSIONThis paper discovered that there is a lack of theoretical understanding and statistics on the economic impact of MIS maturity on Nigerian MDAs and the private sector on the Nigerian economy. Based on responses collected from 109 MDA managers in Nigeria, the study used covariance-based SEM to explore the fitness of the model and the relationships between the variables.

As a result, policymakers in the Nigerian MDA face a conundrum in determining which MIS maturity problems have the greatest potential to lead to the country's long-term economic success. The potential economic benefit of MIS maturity in Nigerian MDAs cannot be realized without a comprehensive knowledge of these concerns. Although we provide no empirical data to support the proposed model's application, we believe our conceptual work offers a small contribution. First, despite acknowledging the relevance of IT in MIS operations, neither sustainability nor IS/IT literature has explicitly presented any IT maturity models specifically suited for the SSCMIS context (to the best of our knowledge). As a result, our strategy is the first known attempt to expressly connect corporate IT with SSCMIS programs. Second, many IT maturity models focus solely on process components. Unlike others, our study integrates four-dimensional influences into a single model. Third, we believe that, once convinced of the huge financial ramifications of sustainability practices within their organizations, senior corporate executives, risk managers, and IT Managers will adopt them. Finally, from the findings of the literature research and surveys, Nigerian MDAs' technological advancement and service delivery are a primary cause for implementing the Maturity Model in MIS. One"
"risk managers, and IT Managers will adopt them. Finally, from the findings of the literature research and surveys, Nigerian MDAs' technological advancement and service delivery are a primary cause for implementing the Maturity Model in MIS. One gets the impression that most of Nigeria's MDA is dependent on, or reactive to, technology innovation in other parts of the world; this management strategy may result in Nigerian MDAs never reaching their full potential, or worse, not being able to compete with international ICT enterprises.ACKNOWLEDGMENTOur acknowledgement goes to all who have helped in contributing to the success of this manuscript, through data gathering, analysis, and editing the manuscript.FUNDING INFORMATIONThe research paper received no internal or external funding.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors of this publication declare there is no conflict of ideas and interest.APPENDIX A: RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRENota Bene (Note well):IS: Information SystemIT: Information TechnologyMIS: Management Information SystemSSCM: Sustainability Supply Chain ManagementSSCMIS: Sustainability Supply Chain Management Information SystemMDAs: Ministries, Department & Agencies(A) General information about the department and the respondentQ1Please state your managerial role in your department:☐ Financial☐ Maintenance☐ Functional☐ IT☐ RiskOthers (specify)Q2Please indicate the level of education that you have obtained.

"AbstractAfter the preliminary design of university management information system is completed, the related systems are optimized through IOT and intelligent computing. The data of the system is monitored and trained through IOT. Through the training data, it can be seen that the maximum difference between the actual output and the predicted output data of the Internet of Things is about 4. By calculating the error percentage of the predicted and actual output values, it is found that the maximum error percentage is about 0.0632, and less than 0.1 is a normal error. The IIA model is compared with MQT model, HAMT model, and SAR model in four different function states. Through the analysis of iteration times, it is found that the best value of IIA model is 12 and the average value is 14. Compared with the other three models, the convergence degree is higher, the calculation time is shorter, and the calculation results are more accurate.

The concept that the Internet of Things is a belated communication world view is obtained [5]. Through the research and analysis of intelligent computing, we can see that it plays an important role in medical planning, diagnosis, and treatment. Combining ICM algorithm with GA, ANN, FL, and other algorithms, a study illustrates the role of intelligent computing in the medical field.

"of years. These two types of fuels have played a role as main energy sources for decades. Currently, they are still the primary energy sources for residential lighting, cooking, and heating to transportation and industrial manufacturing. This phenomenon will remain for a long time; in [1], it concludes that the total energy consumption trend will still continue to grow before 2040. However, a fact which sometimes is ignored is that oil and gas companies are intensive energy-consumption companies and are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions as well [2]. Recently, with the arrival of the \"double carbon\" era, the energy-intensive production of oil and gas has drawn a lot of criticism from environmentalist, company managers, investors, and stakeholders as well. Thus, the petroleum industry must pay more efforts on reducing carbon emissions.Currently, the big data technology as well as the Internet of things (IoT) is developing at a rapid pace, and the metering infrastructure technology also shows a huge advancement; oil and gas enterprises have invested a lot of efforts on digital software development and hardware construction for the aim of reducing the oil production cost via the emerging information technologies; outcomes show that these investments are beneficial for improving the energy efficiency and lowing the production cost.

For example, the WSN has become a widely-used technology in oil and gas fields among the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors for monitoring the important production processes and controlling the vital operations [3-5]. In [6], it explicitly discussed the advantages of digital technologies of gas production from a different viewpoint, and these promising advantages are included in the case of some special gas wells; with these advanced digital gas exploitation tools, the terms of cost-effective exploitation are most likely to be extended from decreasing production stage, and finally it would contribute to increased labor productivity.Though, these information technologies bring a lot of benefits for the oil and gas production, and large quantity of data are collected by these devices as well as from thousands of other sensors and systems to help managers make decisions about the operations, often in near-real time. However, due to the different development standards, like data entry name, acquisition frequency, and so on, there is a data barrier between these systems which discounts the usage and analysis of these rich data resources.

"part of this work is designed as follows: Section2describes the related work from the literature review, and the proposed system and its details are discussed in Section3. Section4elaborates the application of the proposed intelligent system, and the conclusion is drawn at the end.2. Literature ReviewIn the literature, some intelligent energy management systems based on machine learning methods have been researched; in this section, the related research efforts in this regard are discussed.Regarding the intelligent energy consumption prediction, various efforts have been done so far. Zhang et al. [7] had introduced an intelligent solar energy system which is able to accurately predict day-ahead power for small-scale solar photovoltaic electricity generators; two commonly-used methods are discussed with good performance and high accuracy. The Rao designed models over the time series for one day-ahead solar power calculation and the best consequence with 9.28% error [8] are presented. In the building area, Guo et al. explored some popular machine learning techniques to forecast total energy consumption over the indoor heating system [9]. In addition, some efforts are made via directly using the regression method to predict the total energy demand; finally, it turned out that the simple regression method like weighted support vector regression and multilinear regression [10-12] are able to achieve promising performance.In the oil and gas domain, some impressive research work"
"the total energy demand; finally, it turned out that the simple regression method like weighted support vector regression and multilinear regression [10-12] are able to achieve promising performance.In the oil and gas domain, some impressive research work about the intelligent energy management system with digital technologies have been published in [14]; it is concluded that the digital methods have the ability to find the significant opportunities to reform the production condition and enhance the production performance; then, finally, the energy efficiency of oil exploration is improved. And the other related literatures [15-18] also proved that the digital methods are able to offer good chances for the energy reduction over the oil exploration by cutting production cost.In [13], the author discussed the energy consumption prediction with the commonly-used machine learning algorithms in the oil and gas domain; the results of the experiments show that these intelligent algorithms are able to calculate high prediction result for energy consumption, but the hybrid model of those algorithms would present the better performance; the flow chart of this proposed method is shown in Figure1. And the proposed method is applied in the energy management system of one oil petroleum company to calculate the total energy consumption amount, and it turns out it has improved the efficiency.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe flow chart of the proposed model in [13].In summary, all"

Thus, in this paper, we invested the intelligent energy management system with three main functions and four commonly-used algorithms, and a real case of the proposed system was summarized in case of total energy consumption prediction.3. Proposed System3.1. The System ArchitectureThe discussed intelligent energy management system configuration consists of three models: (1) data lake, (2) data analyzing, and (3) data visualization. The data lake module presents the data pipe from independent operating systems to the data lake, and then all the data are stored and classified at the data lake level. The data analyzing module describes the data analytics engine with intelligence; four machine learning methods are installed in this engine, and the data from the data lake can use these algorithms directly.

"with intelligence; four machine learning methods are installed in this engine, and the data from the data lake can use these algorithms directly. The data visualization module shows the data directly with ECharts; in this dashboard the patterns, the trends, and the anomalies are easily identified. The overall architecture is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe architecture of the proposed system.3.2. Energy Consumption Data Lake in Oil and Gas FieldCurrently, the terms of data lake are described as a tool to accumulate meta data from the other heterogenous data sources. Basically, data lake plays a role of data respiratory in a company, and all kinds of data with different types, format, and structures are stored in it, regardless of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data [19]. As compared with data warehouse, data lakes are more suitable to store and retrieve various formats of data from the data repository than to play the role of domain specific [20]. Thus, data lakes were built to store all the energy consumption data from the heterogenous data sources, for example, the various system and the related documents of meeting records and training contents.Guided by the details presented in [20], we proposed an energy consumption data lake system to collect data from heterogenous data sources of all related systems in oil and gas fields. The proposed data lake architecture is implemented with Hadoop, which offer the ability to replicate data"
"[20], we proposed an energy consumption data lake system to collect data from heterogenous data sources of all related systems in oil and gas fields. The proposed data lake architecture is implemented with Hadoop, which offer the ability to replicate data without high performance calculation and process the data with MapReduce. The proposed data lake system contains four virtual machines which consist of two virtual cores, 32 GB RAM, 500GB disk space.When the data lake was built, some data technologies to collect data from diverse data source are needed. In the terms of the structured data that are stored in the other related information systems, the Apache Flume tool is mainly considered. This tool has three main components, including, source, sink, and channel, and the work flow is briefly drawn in Figure3. The source is responsible for collecting the data from the other systems, and then delivers them to the sink for ingestion to the HDFS by the channel. For the other format data, like the data embedded in the HTML pages or PDF documents, some costumed scripts are required, and some related work over this issue has been made, like Beautiful Soup 4 (BS4) [21], Selenium [22], and Pandas [23].Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe work flow of Apache Flume.We use these tools together to extract the related information from the webpages and the PDF documents of meeting records and training contents.On the ground of data availability, the manual and automated methods are"
"work flow of Apache Flume.We use these tools together to extract the related information from the webpages and the PDF documents of meeting records and training contents.On the ground of data availability, the manual and automated methods are discussed in our process. For the data which is not often used or updated rarely, like annual reports, we ingested these data manually from the data source into the systems with HDFS commands directly. For the data which is collected every hour, daily or monthly, some scripts are designed to load these data automatically, and in case of the real-time data, a push-based technology with a custom source in the Flume agent configuration is used to inject the data to the HDFS and to secure reliability; the file channel also which is designed for cached data is considered to handle instances of failure.3.3. Energy Consumption Data Analytics with Machine LearningWe also develop data processing and analyzing function for the energy management system, and there are various tools available for that, such as Apache Solr and Apache Spark. Apache Spark is popular over data analysis since it offers many APIs to developers for general programming languages, like, Java and Python, and has been widely used in many cases [24]. Moreover, they developed the Spark's machine learning library which includes the generally-used machine learning algorithms and allow the system users to analyze these data in a fast manner. In addition, they also provide the"
"used in many cases [24]. Moreover, they developed the Spark's machine learning library which includes the generally-used machine learning algorithms and allow the system users to analyze these data in a fast manner. In addition, they also provide the stream processing functions for real-time processing.Based on the data lake, four commonly-used machine learning methods are installed on the proposed system, so called, support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), extreme learning machine (ELM), and artificial neural network (ANN), and the related work from Section2has discuss their ability for prediction. They are developed with the Spark's machine learning library, so that these algorithms are easily configured and designed in our system.The current implementation of data analyzing with these methods are designed for two cases in our system: (1) predicting the oil and gas production and (2) predicting the total energy consumption. The flow chart for data analyzing with these methods is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe flow chart of data analytics with machine learning.For the case of predicting the oil and gas production, first we choose the data from the data lake; the data include the history oil and gas production data; then, we put these history data into these algorithms as training data; when the training procedure is finished, the model with the highest accuracy will be chosen and saved as the final model.Finally, the final model"
"history oil and gas production data; then, we put these history data into these algorithms as training data; when the training procedure is finished, the model with the highest accuracy will be chosen and saved as the final model.Finally, the final model would be used in practice to help the system users to predict the following days' oil and gas production.For the case of predicting the total energy consumption, the crude oil output and natural gas output as the feature vector to predict total process-production energy consumption, so the training dataset is represented by tripe (x,y, andz), wherexmeans the monthly crude oil output,ydenotes monthly natural gas output, andzdenotes the monthly total process-production energy consumption. Then, the training data is put into these algorithms for training. When the training process is finished, we mark and save the final model for usage in practice.3.4. Energy Consumption Data Visualization by EChartsThe data analyzing has presented some insights of data from data lake, but for more insight and details from the data, the data visualization turns out to be a powerful tool for that, and it can easily be developed through web-interface or the Java-based and python-based library, which allows developers to design bar graph, pie charts, and the other dynamic dashboards with graphics very quickly.In our study, the most widely-used tool ECharts [25] is discussed.

"which allows developers to design bar graph, pie charts, and the other dynamic dashboards with graphics very quickly.In our study, the most widely-used tool ECharts [25] is discussed. The ECharts does supply almost all the basic graphs and charts that the users needed for data visualization, like, line charts, bar charts, scatter charts, and so on. What is more interesting is that developers are able to develop charts and graphs with ECharts very easily and quickly without too much software developing knowledge. In addition, ECharts can display the visualization of tons of data with extremely large volume, and it would not discount the ability of scaling and transforming of data. Concerning the friendly interface and the geographic data, ECharts offers eye-catching visual effects for the line data and point data visualization. And it turns out to be a very declarative framework for rapid construction of web-based visualization. The samples of data visualization are shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe samples of data visualization by ECharts.4. Use Case of our SystemIn this part, we will use the dataset collected from one oil and gas company's energy management system to validate the performance of our proposed system. The flow process consists of three main steps, including, dataset, model design, and prediction result.4.1.

"of our proposed system. The flow process consists of three main steps, including, dataset, model design, and prediction result.4.1. DatasetIn our work, we collected the data from the company's energy management system; according to the requirements of the system management, the energy related data are collected once every month. Thus, we considered a ten-year dataset which consist of 120 observations in total. Part of the data samples is shown in Figure6, and there is strong complexity and weak time relation between these data samples. Thus, the time-related parameters are not considered in our paper and the tripe (x,y, andz) is designed; wherexmeans the monthly crude oil output,ydenotes monthly natural gas output, andzdenotes the monthly total process-production energy consumption. These 120 data samples are divided into training dataset and test dataset, and the training dataset have 90 data samples and the rest of data belongs to the test dataset.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointPart of energy production and consumption data sample.4.2. Model DesignIn our intelligent energy management systems, there are four machine learning algorithms installed which included SVM, LR, ELM, and ANN.For the LR model, concerning the dimension of the input, there are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression; in our work, the input vector has two dimensions, namely, crude oil output and natural gas output, so the multiple linear regression model with equation (1) is"
"the dimension of the input, there are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression; in our work, the input vector has two dimensions, namely, crude oil output and natural gas output, so the multiple linear regression model with equation (1) is discussed:(1)WhereYdenotes the prediction result,X1andX2mean the monthly crude oil output and monthly gas production, andβ0,β1, andβ2are the coefficient of the multiple linear regression model. For the ANN, due to the limitation of the dataset size, a three-layer artificial neural network is built in the system to forecast the monthly energy consumption, and the first layer has 2 neurons, the hidden layer has 3, respectively, and the final layer has of 1 neuron for the total energy consumption prediction result. The sigmoid is chosen as the active function between these layers. Compared with ANN, the ELM just contains one hidden layer, so, therefore, highly reduces the computational cost. Regarding the energy prediction, a lot of research work has been done with this model; in this paper, we build the ELM model which consists of 4 neurons in the middle layer to forecast the energy consumption. Finally, the SVM also is considered to validate the predicting performance of the monthly energy consumption prediction, and we choose polynomial kernel function from the model to construct the SVM model. All the design and training procedure are finished through the intelligent energy management system.4.3. Prediction ResultThis part"

Prediction ResultThis part would discuss the prediction result of the installed four machine learning methods. We chose the RMSE as the metric to evaluate the prediction performance of these models:(2)whereNmeans the size of data set,videnotes the label value, andmeans the calculated value. Usually, the better method prediction performance is presented with smaller value of RMSE. Table1shows the RMSE result of four methods over training and test dataset.Table  1.The RMSE result of four models over training and test dataset.ModelTest datasetTraining datasetSupport vector machine4.233.32Linear regression6.732.24Extreme learning machine0.780.37Artificial neural network0.630.42These experiment results show that the four methods are able to calculate the prediction results with good accuracy. However, the LR method achieved prediction results with the lowest accuracy, and it revealed that there is no strong linear correlation between the oil production and energy consumption. The ELM algorithm and the ANN predicted the energy consumption with highest accuracy, and it revealed that these two models can be used to forecast monthly total energy consumption in a company and demonstrated the feasibility of the management system for the case of monthly total"
"ANN predicted the energy consumption with highest accuracy, and it revealed that these two models can be used to forecast monthly total energy consumption in a company and demonstrated the feasibility of the management system for the case of monthly total energy consumption calculation in oil and gas sector.5. ConclusionMany oil and gas companies have collected a lot of data and these data are lacking future analyzation. Thus, in this paper, we discussed the intelligent energy management system in the oil and gas industry. First, the innovation over breaking the \"data barrier\" among each system was introduced; we discussed the methodology of \"data lake\". Then, aimed at enhancing data analytics and making most of these data, four different machine learning algorithms, SVM, LR, SVM, and ELM, are installed in the proposed system with the \"data lake\" for predicting the oil and gas production and total energy consumption; the system offers the whole process of model design, training, and calculation. The system can make use of such models directly without any code work.

"the proposed system into one oil and gas company to validate the feasibility of this system, and it suggests that this system is able to calculate the prediction results with good accuracy, but due to no strong linear correlation between these data, the artificial neural network achieves the best result.In future, the primary task is to improve the system's performance security, scalability, accuracy, standardization, automation, and some other aspects. To achieve this goal, we will try to use more data from other oil and gas companies to validate the systems' performance and robustness, and more intelligent methods would be considered to be installed in this system. What is more, combining the proposed system with the other big data and advanced new IT technologies to develop more intelligent energy management information system is our main upcoming work as well.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityAll dataset used during the study has appeared in the submitted article.References12019,https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporat%20e/energyeconomics/energy-%20outlook/introduction/overvie%20w.html.Google Scholar2Saadawi H.,Application of renewable energy in the oil and gas industry,SPE Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference, 2019, Manama, Bahrain,https://doi.org/10.2118/194972-MS.10.2118/194972-MSGoogle Scholar3Savazzi S.,Spagnolini U.,Goratti L.,Molteni D.,Latva-aho M., andNicoli M.,Ultra-wide band"

"AbstractWith the improvement of people's living standards, the traditional hotel management model has been unable to meet the needs of customers. The traditional hotel management model also has the defects of low efficiency. The hotel management model is also gradually developing towards the direction of intelligence. The combination of artificial intelligence technology and hotel management can not only improve the operation efficiency of the hotel but also solve the operation cost of the hotel. For customers, artificial intelligence technology can bring smarter and more comfortable accommodation conditions to customers. This study uses the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) technology in artificial intelligence technology to conduct related research on the in-store mode, entertainment mode, sleep mode, and out-of-store mode in hotel management. CNN is used to extract the spatial features of hotel management, and LSTM is used to extract the temporal features of hotel management. The research results show that CNN and LSTM technology can help hotel management achieve intelligent management and optimization. CNN and LSTM techniques can better predict related factors in-store entry mode, entertainment mode, and sleep mode. For the correlated predictions of these four modes, the maximum prediction error is only 2.81%. The linear correlation coefficient also reached above 0.96. The relevant parameters of artificial intelligence technology are"
"mode, and sleep mode. For the correlated predictions of these four modes, the maximum prediction error is only 2.81%. The linear correlation coefficient also reached above 0.96. The relevant parameters of artificial intelligence technology are also suitable for the optimization and design of hotel information systems.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of computer performance, information systems have been widely used in hotel management. Compared with traditional manual methods, information systems can have better efficiency in hotel management. In today's society, people begin to pursue a higher level of quality of life [1,2]. Whether it is in the process of business trip or tourism, they not only need the level of accommodation, but they are also constantly pursuing a higher level of hotel service. This puts forward higher requirements for the management level of the hotel. Hotel management is not only limited to the management of the hotel front desk, but it also needs to achieve a higher level of management of the hotel rooms. The management of the hotel front desk needs to achieve higher efficiency and more accurate management, which will save many manpower and material resources of the hotel front desk [3]. At the same time, efficient hotel front desk management will save more time for the occupants, and it will also provide more convenience for the occupants. The provision of hotel management level will provide occupants with a more comfortable and warmer"
