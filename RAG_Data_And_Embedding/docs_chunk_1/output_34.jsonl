"materials\" is therefore considered very important in each phase of a claim. Furthermore, \"tracking down evidentiary materials\" requires much effort and resources; in this process, the documented information related to the claim that was generated during the course of the construction is collected.Despite the fact that managing documented materials is very important as they can be used as evidentiary materials for a claim, current construction site management often overlooks the importance of document management in the context of raising or defending against claims, and document management often faces difficulties due to the urgent situations that arise at sites and due to overall construction management [24]. In order to collect the documents that may serve as evidentiary materials for a claim, it is necessary to collect information from the documents archived at the site or to collect the necessary documents by tracking down the person who was in charge of the documents. However, collecting claim-related documents from site-archived documents often faces the difficulty of having to invest much effort and resources in verifying and reviewing the numerous document files kept at the site. Also, trying to collect claim-related documented materials by tracking down the person in charge also often meets with difficulty because the personnel deployed to a project are often deployed to another project after the project is finished, which leads to the dispersion of documented"
"documented materials by tracking down the person in charge also often meets with difficulty because the personnel deployed to a project are often deployed to another project after the project is finished, which leads to the dispersion of documented information related to the claim.However, the information management database proposed in this study allows for the convenient collection of claim-related documents through its system of categorization and the storage of electronic replicas of the documents generated by sites, which may precede physical review of the actual documents archived at the site, thus decreasing the possibility of failing at collecting claim-related evidentiary materials. Furthermore, during the process of collecting information, the query and search system built into the database enables the expedient collection of information, while one may also confirm and review related information by selecting an Object in the linked BIM model. Figure11is a diagram depicting the claim material collection process under the current system and the collection process using the construction information database system.Figure 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of claim materials' collection processes.According to an interview with an official in charge of handling claims at General Construction Company, while differences do exist across sites, sites with an insufficient document management system required about 3∼4 hours for collecting claim-related evidentiary"
"to an interview with an official in charge of handling claims at General Construction Company, while differences do exist across sites, sites with an insufficient document management system required about 3∼4 hours for collecting claim-related evidentiary materials, while in about 5% of cases, the collection of evidentiary materials was difficult due to the loss of materials. As such, if document management is conducted by continuously inputting information into a construction information database during the course of construction, the time and resources needed to collect documented information regarding claims will be decreased, while the success rate for collecting such materials will in turn increase, enabling more expedient and accurate claim processing. This process can be implemented as shown in Figure12.Figure 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointDatabase search screen for the collection of claim-related materials.The parameters that link the construction information database with the BIM model are inserted as elementary characteristics of the Object, and these inserted Parameters are composed as database access addresses that are linked to the construction information database (Part A of Figure12).

"information database linked to the BIM model, its user interface was composed with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), and this user interface was composed so that the SBS and the electronic documents linked to the SBS would show the parts related to the IBS. When one searches the space-based categorization system pertinent to the framework in which the defect arose as in Part B of Figure12, the information concerning the documents related to the relevant space-based categorization system is categorized based on the information categorization system and become available for verification as shown in Part C of Figure12. In the case depicted in Figure12, the electronic documents linked to the relevant framework are such that the specifications and construction journals were mutually linked, and therefore only the electronic documents relevant to said information appear.The related construction documents are stored in the database through these linkages to the space-based categorization system of the pertinent framework using the BIM model; this enables the convenient review and confirmation of needed materials in cases of claims and other circumstances where the collection of documents on completed construction projects is needed, and it is expected that more systematic management of construction-related information will become possible through gathering related construction information into a construction information database using such information categorization systems.6."
"and it is expected that more systematic management of construction-related information will become possible through gathering related construction information into a construction information database using such information categorization systems.6. Conclusion and the Limits of the StudyThe construction industry is becoming increasingly complex, while the scale and number of participants in a project continue to grow, leading to the generation of large amounts of data as well as the need to manage such information. In particular, the construction phase is the phase in which the building itself is formed based on the blueprints and generates various types of data that need management. Since much of information during the construction phase is generated as documents, at present it is difficult to effectively gather the generated information.In response, this study sought to propose a database system designed for data gathering and connections between structural and nonstructural information for the effective accumulation of construction information using BIM. For this purpose, a database system for information management based on a categorization system for documented information was proposed, and a proposal was also made to link structural and nonstructural information. In addition, the possibility of implementing such a database system was assessed through scenarios.

"structural and nonstructural information. In addition, the possibility of implementing such a database system was assessed through scenarios. The assessment showed that documented information could be extracted from the documents that were generated at construction sites and could form a database, while related documents could be extracted through the use of the gathered data.It is believed that the results of this study will enable the formation of a system for gathering construction information by linking structural and nonstructural information, and it is also believed that the use of accumulated information for follow-up projects will aid in accumulation of know-how by construction companies.However, while the BIM-based construction information database proposed in this study was formed based on the information generated by construction sites and through categorization systems for site-generated information, its viability was assessed through the use of scenarios rather than through direct application at actual construction sites and the attendant quantitative analysis of such direct application. As such, in order to further verify the anticipated effects of the model proposed in this study, it will be necessary to conduct an analysis through direct application at actual construction sites.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThe research was supported by a grant (17RERP-B082173-04) from Residential Environment"

"AbstractIn recent years, China has focused on the development of sports and adopted modern, scientific, and standardized management of referees. Global sports events are becoming increasingly fierce. One of the main links is to manage the referee group and ensure the fairness and impartiality of sports competitions. In sports competition, referees implement sports rules, so the quality of referees directly determines whether sports events are fair and just. Cheerleading operation was introduced into China as a new sports event and spread rapidly in major universities and primary and secondary schools. With the increase of the number of cheerleading athletes, the number of referees also continues to increase. Referees' information management has become the main problem. Therefore, this paper uses data mining technology to design and develop cheerleading referee information management system, uses the system to manage the basic information of cheerleading referees, and analyzes the sanction ability and strength of cheerleading referees. This paper first introduces the basic concept and operational process of data mining algorithm, and C4.5 decision tree algorithm, and support vector machine algorithm. Based on this algorithm, a cheerleading referee information management system is established. Then, we analyze the system structure and demand analysis and design the main structure of the system.

"a cheerleading referee information management system is established. Then, we analyze the system structure and demand analysis and design the main structure of the system. Finally, the number of cheerleading referees is analyzed. The highest proportion of referees is 29.5%, the number of referees is 3 to 5 times, and the highest proportion of referees with more than 10 times per year is 59.24%. Using this system to analyze the strength of cheerleading referees, the most influential factor is the lack of on-the-spot experience, accounting for 38.83%.1.

These analyses or examinations are utilized to assist an individual in solving a particular business challenge at hand. Enterprises can be enabled to forecast future trends and make better educated and informed business decisions. These are becoming possible due to the extensive qualities of the data mining techniques and technologies which are developed in order to carry out these task in an effective way.

"almost every era of the business especially in those scenarios where evaluation or extensive analysis is needed.Cheer-up has a strong sense of rhythm, uniqueness, and fitness. It can highlight the energetic and positive spirit of young people, and it has become one of the most favorite sports of colleges and students. Cheer-up is mainly carried out in colleges and universities. It can attract a large number of students to become check-up athletes or referees and build a complete check-up team. At the same time, the integration of physical education content in cheer-up can stimulate students' learning initiative [1].Chinese cheer-up referees' information management is still kept on paper, which makes it hard to discover and has less content. As a result, it cannot satisfy the involved parties' fundamental demands for the referees' information management. In order to address this issue and increase the effectiveness of information management, a cheer-up referees' information management system is set up using a data mining algorithm, and data mining technology is used to precisely, scientifically, and safely manage the cheer-up referees' information [2].The main innovations in this research process are as follows.

Related WorkNowadays, people's quality of life is improving day by day. The value of cheerleading in fitness, medical treatment, health care, entertainment, and bodybuilding is sought after by people. However, there is less research on the information management of cheerleading referees. Kim et al. pointed out that the most common types of cheerleading are skill cheerleading and dance cheerleading and further subdivided them into street dance, flower ball, free dance, and jazz dance [4]. Jing studied the cheerleading training in Shandong Province and analyzed the coaches' ability, training, and athletes' quality, which restrict the cheerleading training [5]. In order to increase the quantity and quality of cheerleading coaches and support the school curriculum system in establishing a cheerleading club, Qin analyzed the participation of college cheerleading teams, the current situation of cheerleading athletes, and the team of coaches and analyzed the"
"of cheerleading coaches and support the school curriculum system in establishing a cheerleading club, Qin analyzed the participation of college cheerleading teams, the current situation of cheerleading athletes, and the team of coaches and analyzed the future development trend of cheerleading in combination with the unique culture of different regions [6]. Zhang created an industrialized system by researching American cheering. It supports the tremendous growth of American cheerleading as the core component of the American sports business [7]. Based on the United States' strong cheerleading history, cheerleading competitions, training methods, and management strategies are used to advance development rights and interests. According to the current situation of cheerleading referee management, the main problems of referee management are uneven level, single physique, lack of scientific research ability, etc. corresponding management measures shall be taken to solve those problems [8]. Li studied the development status of Chinese dance referees from the micro and macro-perspectives, constructed the referees' information management database, and introduced the benign mechanism [9].

Overview of Data Mining AlgorithmsInitially, a brief but thorough and rigorous review of the data mining approach is presented below but starting with its definition and then describing its steps one by one.3.1. Concept and Process of Data MiningData mining is a process of analyzing and finding datasets.

"Data mining can find the internal rules and relationships of data and predict the future development trend based on the current data [14]. Data mining can be applied to data warehouse, relational database, advanced database system, and transaction database. Its generation mode is efficient, understandable, potentially valuable, and effective. Generally, the information obtained by data mining reflects three characteristics, namely, effectiveness, predictability, and practicability.Data mining techniques are being updated and enhanced as information technology advances quickly. Data mining aims to uncover hidden laws or patterns in data in order to provide decision makers a solid data foundation. Data mining is a multi-step, repetitive process. Prior to beginning data mining, it is important to define the mining object, acquire the necessary technology and skills, and advance our understanding of the data and company.

The information gain essence of attributeAis the unconditional direct values of classCin datasetS. The unconditional direct values of classCis divided according to attributeA, which is shown below:(1)The following are the unconditional direct values of classCattribute:(2)Assuming that attributeAhasVvalue types, the conditional direct values ofCcan be calculated by dividing the dataset based on this:(3)Since describing attributes improves the categorization ability of attribute classes, the information gain value is positive, and the split information is introduced into the C4 algorithm to adjust the information gain. The following are the basic formulas for calculating attributeAsplit information values:(4)Finally, the following information gain rates are obtained:(5)In order to improve the uniformity and breadth of attribute division data, denominator with information gain rate can increase the number of attribute values, increase the amount of split information, decrease the rate of return, and also significantly remove the drawbacks of the number of attribute values.3.3.

Its classification goal is to divide instances into any type of probability according to the value of self-confession energy. In this paper,X= (X1,X2,X3, ...,Xk) vector moisturizing data are used to describe the set of attributes,Yrepresents the attribute of data category,P(X) is the probability thatYoccurs relative toX, and the following is the definition function:(6)Nonlinear relationships among attributes are represented byP(X), andf(X) is a linear model based on linear regression theory, as follows:(7)Logarithms of the above formulas are obtained:(8)The logistic regression model can reflect the impact of eachXchange on the classification prediction probability results, the sound value is the maximum solution on the logarithmic likelihood function of the predicted category attribute value vector, and the following is the logarithmic likelihood function expression:(9)3.4. Support Vector Machine AlgorithmsA classification technique based on class distinctions is the support vector machine (SVM). For data instances with p unique properties, it may be seen as a p-dimensional vector. Choosing whether to divide the instances using a p-1-dimensional hyperplane is the transformation problem.

With the help of this approach, we can separate two maximum edge hyperplanes. The support vector machine approach is best suited for problems involving binary classification. The datasetDis represented by the following formula, assuming that theYclass attributes have values between −1 and 1, where the attributes are given asXvectors in the P-1 dimension:(10)Within a data space composed of datasets, the decision boundary edge superplane is represented by the following formulas:(11)Add the following constraints to allow data points to fall outside the edge line:(12)So, the equivalent linear support vector machine maximizes the edge to minimize the objective function, which is calculated using the Lagrange multiplier formula:(13)In order to soften the constraints for linear inseparable problems, the optimal segmentation plane can be obtained by adding a smallξirelaxation factor to all data instances in the above formula. By measuring the loss penalty factorCgenerated by the ignored outliers, the relaxation factor can be minimized.

Cheerleading Referee Information Management System Based on Data MiningData mining is the process of examining and locating datasets. Data mining can identify the inherent patterns and connections in data as well as forecast future development trends using the data already available [14]. Data warehouses, relational databases, sophisticated database systems, and transaction databases may all benefit from data mining. Its generating process is efficient, clear, possibly beneficial, and effective. In general, data mining information reveals three qualities: efficacy, predictability, and practicability.4.1. Information Management System StructureBased on the data mining algorithm, this paper establishes the cheerleading referee information management system, in which the information management system (MIS) focuses on people, collects data by using software, computer hardware, office equipment and network communication, and realizes data transmission, storage, maintenance, and update, so as to comprehensively improve the operation efficiency and benefit of the information system and integrate the middle-level control.

"and middle-level operation of enterprises have become a unified man-machine system [16].One component corresponds to many frames when the management information system is separated into several different sections, and the mathematical index is utilized to forecast the structural quantity of the constituent system. Conceptual structure refers to the fundamental organization of management information systems. The MIS system is conceptually examined. Information processor, information source, information manager, and information consumer are some of its constituent parts. The major information comes from the information source. In order to give information managers and users, the information processor carries out the activities of information transmission, processing, and storage, converting the data into information or processed information. Managers are randomly selected as information users. Based on different information decision-making data on MIS, information managers analyze, design, develop, and coordinate different parts of the system, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation management system structure.4.2.

"establishes a cheerleading referee information management system based on data mining. Its technical module components include background framework, front-end components, and database [17]. Figure3shows the basic sequence of system processing during user operation. The user submits the operation application on the system and uses the front-end data to verify and transmit the collected data. After verifying the data, complete the preprocessing based on the business logic, such as converting the digital format to generate statistical data, and complete the data assembly based on the business requirements. Multiple formats are defined in the database and background framework to realize the effective communication between the server and the client. When establishing information, the client program should send data to the server. After receiving the message sent by the client, the server will analyze the information and then further generate new data to return to the client.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointUser operation sequence diagram.The responsibility of the front-end component module is to realize the mutual communication between the customer and the system.

"various operations on the page. After that, the front-end component sends operation information to the background server to realize the mutual interaction with the background database. The most important part of react front-end is component, which can be split into multiple reusable and independent modules to develop front-end components. The background service, which receives the request and data information given by the foreground users, completes the preprocessing operation in accordance with the logical request established in advance and then sends the processed results back to the foreground, which is the logical centre of the system. The system calls the background to carry out the business after converting the JSON-type data given by the react foreground to Java Bean using the CXF framework. Data created on the system are saved and persistently stored using the database module. The system uses the Hibernate framework to do object relationship mapping and translates background service module execution into database operation to access database information.4.3.

"referees include \"referee name,\" \"event name,\" \"team,\" \"event,\" \"effective frequency division rate,\" \"referee score,\" and \"effective frequency division number.\" Since cheerleading is a subjective scoring item, the difference between the referee's evaluation score and the standard score is about 10 points, which are effective points. Therefore, after removing the highest and lowest scores given by the cheerleading referee, other scores are within the effective range.

Analysis of the Number of Cheerleading RefereesThis work develops the cheerleading referee information management system based on the data mining technique. Shaanxi Province is used as an example to examine the number of cheerleading referees when investigating the system's use [19]. It is helpful for Shaanxi Province to develop better strategies to enhance the refereeing ability and quality of cheerleading referees based on the analysis of the plants, the number of referees, and the evaluation data of cheerleading referees in the provincial and international competitions, as well as the comparison of refereeing data between first-class referees and higher-level referees and analysis of the issues.According to each year, there are five types of experience and times of cheerleading referees going out to judge, namely, 0 times, 1-2 times, 3-5 times, 6-10 times, and more than 10 times [20]. The total number of people in this survey is 112. Figure5shows the number of cheerleading referees each year.

Only one person performs 0 times a year, accounting for 0.9% of the total, and 25 cheerleading referees perform 1 to 2 times a year, accounting for 22.3% of the total. The number of referees who perform three to five times a year is 33, accounting for 29.5% of the total. 23 cheerleading referees perform 6 to 10 times a year, accounting for 20.5%. There are 29 cheerleading referees who have performed more than 10 times, accounting for 25.9%. In this statistics, one person did not participate in the enforcement. According to statistics, cheerleading referees participate in the highest proportion of refereeing every year for 3 to 5 games.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointProportion of cheerleading referees.Figure6shows the proportion of the number of first-class cheerleading referees and senior referees. According to the data in Figure6, the proportion varies greatly with different levels of cheerleading referees. The number of senior referees participating in the competition is mostly 3-5 times a year. The number of referees performing more than 10 times a year accounts for 59.24% which is the highest proportion. The first-class referees have a large area, and the number of referees is mostly 1-2 times, 3-5 times, and 6-10 times. The number of referees more than 10 times accounts for 23.64%.

Analysis of the Strength of Cheerleading RefereesWhen analyzing the application effect of cheerleading referee information management system, this paper judges according to the strength of cheerleading referee's on-the-spot judgment ability. The options set mainly include inaccurate grasp of the punishment scale, insufficient understanding of the new rules, lack of on-the-spot experience, audience interference, and others, as shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointAnalysis of the strength of cheerleading referees.The failure to correctly comprehend the referee scale, according to the inquiry and analysis of the data of cheerleading referees in Shaanxi Province, was cited as the primary problem influencing accurate judgment during the on-the-spot execution by 45.6% of the referees. Each referee has unique characteristics, experiences, settings, educational backgrounds, and levels of rule comprehension and is directly influenced by their prior on-the-job refereeing knowledge.

"and is directly influenced by their prior on-the-job refereeing knowledge. He is unable to fully comprehend the regulations and the circumstances on the cheering field during the on-the-spot referee, which leads to disagreements and interruptions in the competition process.Among the referees, 38.83% pointed out that the lack of on-the-spot experience during on-the-spot execution was the main factor leading to wrong judgment. There are many factors causing the lack of on-the-spot experience, such as external factors, self-reasons, and so on. Referees are influenced by their personal work, and the short working hours of referees make them lack on-the-spot experience. 29.56% of the referees pointed out that the factor affecting the accuracy of on-the-spot judgment was the lack of in-depth understanding of the new rules. During the rapid development of cheerleading, the rules of cheerleading will be adjusted accordingly in order to meet the rapid development of cheerleading. Some cheerleading referees cannot effectively understand the adjusted rules, which makes it difficult to flexibly use the experience rules, while senior referees can fully understand the problem, and first-class referees do not fully understand the principle.28.9% of the referees pointed out that the factor affecting the accurate judgment of temporary referees is the interference between athletes and coaches, and coaches and athletes will also directly interfere with the referees' refereeing effect."
"principle.28.9% of the referees pointed out that the factor affecting the accurate judgment of temporary referees is the interference between athletes and coaches, and coaches and athletes will also directly interfere with the referees' refereeing effect. Therefore, referees should better deal with the relationship between cheerleading equipment and personnel and coordinate interpersonal relations, and referees must have very strong adaptability, good expression and communication ability, stable psychological quality, and self-control ability. With all those features, they can deal with the emergencies calmly. 17.9% of the referees pointed out that the audience can also affect the on-the-spot referee's ability, and the audience will also interfere with the referee's correct judgment during the cheerleading competition. Because the referee is not familiar with personal professional ability, he lacks strong psychological quality. 8.12% of the referees were influenced by other factors.6. ConclusionCheerleading is a popular aerobics, which is deeply loved by people. It can not only exercise but also activate the atmosphere. It is an important international competition. An important role in the cheerleading competition is the cheerleading referee, which directly determines the fairness and impartiality of the cheerleading competition and has become a key part of people's attention. However, there is a common problem that the referee information cannot be effectively managed,"
"cheerleading referee, which directly determines the fairness and impartiality of the cheerleading competition and has become a key part of people's attention. However, there is a common problem that the referee information cannot be effectively managed, which is still managed in the traditional paper way, resulting in management confusion. By investigating the demand analysis and system structure of cheerleading referees, the system structure is completed, and the cheerleading referee's information management system is established by using data mining algorithm. The analysis of cheerleading referees information system shows that most referees perform 3-5 times a year, and the percentage of referees who perform more than 10 times a year make up the biggest percentage which reach to 59.24%. The absence of on-the-spot experience, which accounts for 38.83% of the system's analysis of cheerleading referee strength, has the most impact.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by the Sichuan Province Key Research Bases in Philosophy and Social Sciences Project and Tianfu International Sports Events Research Centre Project.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.References1Litsa M.,Bekiari A., andSpanou K.,Social Network Analysis in Physical Education Classes: Attractiveness of Individuals"

"AbstractVaccines can reduce antibiotic use and, consequently, antimicrobial resistance by averting vaccine-preventable and secondary infections. We estimated the associations between private vaccine and antibiotic consumption across Indian states during 2009-2017 using monthly and annual consumption data from IQVIA and employed fixed-effects regression and the Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model for panel data regression, which controlled for income and public sector vaccine use indicators obtained from other sources. In the annual data fixed-effects model, a 1% increase in private vaccine consumption per 1000 under-5 children was associated with a 0.22% increase in antibiotic consumption per 1000 people (P< 0.001). In the annual data GMM model, a 1% increase in private vaccine consumption per 1000 under-5 children was associated with a 0.2% increase in private antibiotic consumption (P< 0.001). In the monthly data GMM model, private vaccine consumption was negatively associated with antibiotic consumption when 32, 34, 35, and 44-47 months had elapsed after vaccine consumption, with a positive association with lags of fewer than 18 months. These results indicate vaccine-induced longer-term reductions in antibiotic use in India, similar to findings of studies from other low- and middle-income countries.IntroductionAlthough most high-income countries (HICs) have greater access to antibiotics and greater consumption of antibiotics per capita than low- and"
"antibiotic use in India, similar to findings of studies from other low- and middle-income countries.IntroductionAlthough most high-income countries (HICs) have greater access to antibiotics and greater consumption of antibiotics per capita than low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),1consumption in LMICs overall increased 56% between 2000 and 2015.1India, which is projected to become the world's most populous country by 2024, had the greatest total consumption of antibiotics of any country in 2015, at 6.5 billion defined daily doses (DDDs), an increase of 103% from 2000.1This is more than half the total of 10.3 billion DDDs consumed by all HICs.1,2Despite this high absolute consumption, India's antibiotic consumption rate of 13.6 DDDs per 1000 people per day is less than the global median of 19.5 and the rate of 25.7 in HICs.1Rising consumption reflects improved access to antibiotics among patients in underserved communities within India, but overuse and misuse of antibiotics in communities with greater access remains a major challenge. A recent study of urban India estimated that more than 70% of children undergoing treatment for acute diarrhea may be inappropriately prescribed antibiotics.3Inappropriate use can lead to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leaving patients with fewer treatment options.4Resistance to antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, has reached over 80% for some bacteria in India.5AMR contributes to increased morbidity and mortality,"
"lead to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leaving patients with fewer treatment options.4Resistance to antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, has reached over 80% for some bacteria in India.5AMR contributes to increased morbidity and mortality, especially among neonates;6-8an estimated 58,000 neonatal sepsis deaths annually in India are attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.9Routine childhood vaccination could substantially reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases and secondary infections, thereby reducing both appropriate and inappropriate use of antimicrobials and, in turn, lowering AMR.10-13Consequently, vaccination is an essential component in national and international strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and AMR.14,15The link between vaccines and reductions in antibiotic use is an emerging research area. In the United States and France, studies have found a reduction in antibiotic use associated with introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).16Similarly, in Finland, a trial of the 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine found that antimicrobial use was 8% lower in the vaccinated group.15A recent study found that a 10 percentage point increase in the influenza vaccination rate was associated with a 6.5% reduction in antibiotic use in the United States.17Another study using household survey data from 77 countries found that the PCV and attenuated rotavirus vaccine were associated with 19.7% and 11.4% fewer"
"vaccination rate was associated with a 6.5% reduction in antibiotic use in the United States.17Another study using household survey data from 77 countries found that the PCV and attenuated rotavirus vaccine were associated with 19.7% and 11.4% fewer antibiotic-treated episodes of acute respiratory infection and diarrhea, respectively.18Studies of the effect of vaccination on antibiotic use in LMICs are few, and results from HICs may not be generalizable to India, where the underlying burden of infectious diseases is higher, vaccination rates are lower, out-of-pocket expenditure on health is high, and access to antibiotics is often unregulated.19-21For example, the effect of common vaccines, such as for measles or typhoid, which have been shown to provide additional nonspecific protection against diseases,22cannot be determined in HICs where these vaccines are already widely available. To improve understanding of the relationship between vaccines and antibiotic use, we examined the associations between consumption of vaccines and antibiotics from 2009 to 2017 in the private health sector in India.Materials and methodsDataWe used data on antibiotic and vaccine consumption from January 2009 to December 2017 obtained from IQVIA India.23IQVIA uses sales surveys of private sector healthcare providers to develop state-level estimates of the total volume of consumption of each antibiotic molecule (or combination of molecules) and vaccine.

"IQVIA India.23IQVIA uses sales surveys of private sector healthcare providers to develop state-level estimates of the total volume of consumption of each antibiotic molecule (or combination of molecules) and vaccine. IQVIA's data collection methods are described in greater detail in the Supplemental Text (online only). Antibiotic consumption was reported for 13 states in India and Delhi, a government territory, for each month in 2009-2012 and for 21 states and Delhi for each month in 2013-2017. Data covered monthly and annual sales of 149 types of antibiotics.Data on antibiotics delivered by public sector healthcare providers were not included in this analysis, as nationwide records were only available for gentamicin and co-trimoxazole,24which constituted a negligible proportion of the market overall.25Nationally, 90% of all antibiotic sales in India are through private sector healthcare providers.26,27This proportion of market share has remained stable over time, as health care consumption has risen in both public and private sectors in India. While antibiotics can also be obtained through government-run or affiliated clinics and hospitals, private providers account for 75% of outpatient and 62% of inpatient visits in India, mainly due to the poor quality and long wait times at public providers.28-30As a result, the vast majority of antibiotic consumption is sourced from private providers.To ensure comparability across formulations and products, antibiotic consumption data"
"mainly due to the poor quality and long wait times at public providers.28-30As a result, the vast majority of antibiotic consumption is sourced from private providers.To ensure comparability across formulations and products, antibiotic consumption data (i.e., grams) were converted to DDDs using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC/DDD, 2016) developed by the Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology of the World Health Organization (WHOCC).31For molecules not included in the ATC/DDD index, particularly fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) that are unique to the Indian market, DDD values were estimated using an average of the constituent ingredients' DDDs or as the average of DDD unit values by class, following previous methods used to compare IQVIA antibiotic consumption data across 76 countries.1While other researchers have excluded FDCs from analysis of antibiotic consumption in India, following such an approach would have excluded a large amount of antibiotic consumption data from our analysis.25Where the data indicated the name of the pack but not its strength, the number of grams in each drug was estimated through supplier descriptions on online marketplaces. Where the amount of active ingredient in a drug could not be directly ascertained, it was approximated through direct comparison with drugs of similar molecular composition and manufacture (Supplemental Text, online only).Private vaccine consumption data were obtained from IQVIA based"
"in a drug could not be directly ascertained, it was approximated through direct comparison with drugs of similar molecular composition and manufacture (Supplemental Text, online only).Private vaccine consumption data were obtained from IQVIA based on surveys of vaccine sales in private pharmacies and facilities, and public vaccine consumption data were obtained from the Government of India Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Health Management Information System (HMIS).24We included only vaccinations intended to protect children against diseases that present with symptoms likely to be mistreated with antibiotics: measles, mumps, rubella, influenza,Haemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib), rotavirus, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis,Streptococcus pneumoniae, typhoid, and meningococcal meningitis. We considered the total number of doses of these vaccines, which were available annually and monthly in both the HMIS and IQVIA data.Private sector vaccines account for an estimated 20% of all vaccines in India, and the remaining vaccines are delivered through the national routine childhood vaccination program known as the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP).32The share of private sector vaccination varies across states; for example, for the oral polio vaccine, it ranges from 0.1% in West Bengal to 82% in Kerala.32Because private sector vaccines are financed through out-of-pocket expenditures, their market shares are higher in wealthier states.32The PCV and rotavirus vaccine were"
"for the oral polio vaccine, it ranges from 0.1% in West Bengal to 82% in Kerala.32Because private sector vaccines are financed through out-of-pocket expenditures, their market shares are higher in wealthier states.32The PCV and rotavirus vaccine were introduced gradually in UIP during 2015-2017 and were not widely available through the public healthcare system during the time period of our analysis.33,34The HMIS did not include data on these vaccines before their introduction, as the vaccines were only available in the private sector.The primary source of state-wise population data was the Indian census population projections.35The census was conducted in 2011 before the creation of the state of Telangana in 2014. To account for the separation of one state (Andhra Pradesh) into two (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), we assumed the proportion of population in each state remained constant before and after the separation. Monthly population estimates were constructed using constant linear growth rates year on year. Because the data preceded the creation of the union territory of Ladakh in 2018, we used population estimates for Jammu and Kashmir that did not account for this separation. Annual state-wise income was obtained from the Reserve Bank of India's Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy and normalized to 2011 constant prices.36For state-wise analysis, annual income values were assigned to January and values for other months were interpolated with the assumption of"
"the Reserve Bank of India's Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy and normalized to 2011 constant prices.36For state-wise analysis, annual income values were assigned to January and values for other months were interpolated with the assumption of constant linear growth in income from one year to the next.Antibiotic consumption per 1000 people of all ages was calculated for each state or territory. Vaccine consumption rates were constructed per 1000 children under the age of 5 years in each state or territory.33Although IQVIA only reported aggregate (all ages) antibiotic and vaccine sales data, analysis of the impact of childhood vaccination on overall antibiotic consumption is appropriate for several reasons. First, the 12 vaccines chosen in our analysis are for diseases that mainly affect under-5 children and are often wrongly treated with antibiotics.37Second, with the exception of tetanus vaccinations provided to pregnant women, vaccination of children over 5 years with booster doses and adult vaccination in India are negligible.38While the full extent of adult vaccination in India is unknown and no national guidelines for adult immunization exist in India, evidence to date suggests very low uptake of adult vaccination.39A 2013 study in Pune, India, found that only 8.3% of respondents were vaccinated against influenza during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010, and a 2015 study of HPV awareness among students in a teaching hospital in south India found that only 6.8% of"
"2013 study in Pune, India, found that only 8.3% of respondents were vaccinated against influenza during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010, and a 2015 study of HPV awareness among students in a teaching hospital in south India found that only 6.8% of students surveyed had received the HPV vaccine.40,41Third, evidence from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom has shown that childhood vaccines may reduce the incidence of rotavirus and community-acquired pneumonia in adult contacts of vaccinated children.42-44Secondary protection provided by childhood vaccinations to other members of the household would reduce overall antibiotic use, and this would likely be greater in India than HICs because of lower overall adult vaccination coverage.Statistical analysisWe used fixed effects panel regression analysis to quantify the association between annual vaccination and antibiotic consumption rates. To capture the effect of socioeconomic status on capacity to access medication through the private sector, we included logged state-wise income per capita. Standard errors were clustered at the state level. Fixed effects analysis was used only for annual data, as covariate data were not available in monthly increments.To account for autocorrelation in antibiotic consumption, we also employed the Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, controlling for income.

We evaluated the relationship between antibiotic consumption per capita and vaccination consumption per 1000 children under 5, allowing the time elapsed between vaccine and antibiotic consumption to vary, as vaccination provides long-lasting protection against disease and existing evidence has suggested a reduction in antibiotic use in children aged 24-59 months due to vaccination.18Analysis with annual data was limited by the number of observations, and we did not test models with more than a 2-year difference between the metrics. Analysis with monthly data included up to 48 months between vaccine and antibiotic consumption. STATA version 16.1 was used for all statistical analyses, and results were considered significant atP< 0.05. Additional details of the model are presented in the Supplemental Text (online only).ResultsComplete data were available for 15 states and Delhi for years 2009-2012 and for 21 states and Delhi for 2013-2017 (TableS1, online only).

An estimated 170,000 deaths of under-5 children in India are caused by treatable infections every year.45However, current patterns of antibiotic use indicate that when available, these drugs are often misused. A 2008 study of antibiotic prescribing practices in Uttar Pradesh found that more than 81% of patients in primary and secondary health care facilities were prescribed antibiotics, although facilities with more qualified staff and better infrastructure had lower prescribing rates.46Antibiotics are widely available across India without physician prescription and often dispensed by pharmacists who lack formal training.47-49A 2012 study in southern India found that half of observed pharmacies agreed to sell antibiotics without a prescription and over 60% of the pharmacists gave incorrect advice regarding antibiotic use.48Although the Indian government banned the sale of 350 FDCs of antibiotics in 201650and requires prescriptions for the purchase of antibiotics through brick-mortar (physical) or online pharmacies,51the widescale purchase of banned antibiotic"
"use.48Although the Indian government banned the sale of 350 FDCs of antibiotics in 201650and requires prescriptions for the purchase of antibiotics through brick-mortar (physical) or online pharmacies,51the widescale purchase of banned antibiotic combinations has continued.23Inappropriate use of antibiotics has been identified as a major driver of AMR.52According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, rates of resistance to certain bacteria exceed 90% in some LMICs.53LMICs are particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR due to limited access to water, sanitation, and hygiene, a high burden of infectious disease, and limited access to newer, more effective antibiotics.Vaccines provide protection against primary and secondary infections from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs), such as pneumonia, meningitis, and measles,54and have been shown to decrease antibiotic use in several settings.11,15,55Studies have found a negative association between vaccination rates and antibiotic use in HICs,15,56and emerging evidence suggests a similar association in LMICs. A 2020 study of antibiotic use in LMICs estimated that vaccination with 10- or 13-valent PCV can avert 23.8 million episodes of antibiotic-treated acute respiratory infection in children and vaccination with rotavirus vaccine can avert 13.6 million of antibiotic-treated episodes of diarrhea annually.18Most childhood vaccines provide long-term or lifelong protection against infections.

"respiratory infection in children and vaccination with rotavirus vaccine can avert 13.6 million of antibiotic-treated episodes of diarrhea annually.18Most childhood vaccines provide long-term or lifelong protection against infections. In an aggregate setting such as this study, the relationship between population-level immunity from vaccines and the volume of antibiotic use may evolve over time. We modeled the prolonged effect by varying the number of months elapsed between vaccination and antibiotic consumption and found a negative association at higher lags. While most literature on the impact of vaccination on antibiotic use addresses this relationship over the course of a year or two, other studies have shown reductions in antibiotic use years later.18,57,58Whether this relationship is causal is difficult to determine with certainty, as increased awareness of inappropriate antibiotic use, changes in clinical guidelines or practice, or consumer preferences in the health care market may also affect antibiotic consumption.Increased levels of private sector antibiotic and vaccine consumption at low numbers of lags are likely driven by increased use of health care in the short term. This is supported by our finding that income exhibits a positive association with antibiotic consumption.

"exhibits a positive association with antibiotic consumption. Cyclical associations between public sector vaccination and antibiotic consumption may reflect the impact of regularly scheduled supplementary immunization activities at various points of the year or intermittent distribution of vaccines from the national to state governments. Additionally, efforts such as Mission Indradhanush--a large-scale supplementary immunization program for underserved areas--shifted resources across states, likely resulting in temporal clustering of public sector vaccine delivery and changes in private antibiotic consumption. The relatively poor quality of public sector vaccination data and delays in reporting vaccine distribution figures to HMIS may also influence this relationship.This analysis is novel in its use of Indian vaccine and antibiotic consumption data, and data availability posed limitations. Vaccine data were only available for 9 years, limiting the number of lagged values, which could be used in the annual Arellano-Bond GMM analysis. Data for antibiotic use in the public sector, which is estimated to represent 10% of overall antibiotic consumption,25were not available for most states. The timing of the effect of childhood vaccination for long-term VPDs on antibiotic consumption has not yet been established, so we varied the number of lags to account for this uncertainty.

"for long-term VPDs on antibiotic consumption has not yet been established, so we varied the number of lags to account for this uncertainty. The nature of vaccine consumption in India presented another challenge, as Indian states spanned various stages of introducing rotavirus, PCV, and inactivated polio vaccine during 2009-2017.Age-disaggregated antibiotic sales were not available in our data. As a result, we could not discern how much of the long-term reduction in antibiotic consumption can be attributed to the prevention of VPDs among children and how much may be due to secondary protection afforded to other adults in the household. Previous research has found a direct effect of vaccination on antibiotic use in children, but the indirect effects on antibiotic consumption in adults are not well established.18,57Additional research is needed to study potential spillover effects of child vaccination on illness and antibiotic consumption of caregivers. Finally, antibiotic sales are an imperfect proxy for actual antibiotic use by patients. Better quality data on antibiotic use are necessary to further study the relationship with vaccines.The potential of vaccination to reduce unnecessary antibiotic consumption relies on large-scale investments in childhood vaccination. A large majority of children from all communities must be vaccinated to achieve the necessary threshold for herd immunity and protect susceptible individuals against these diseases.59,60India has made progress"
"investments in childhood vaccination. A large majority of children from all communities must be vaccinated to achieve the necessary threshold for herd immunity and protect susceptible individuals against these diseases.59,60India has made progress toward this goal, but barriers remain. In 2014, Mission Indradhanush was launched with the goal of vaccinating more than 90% of all pregnant women and all children under 2 years of age in India against seven VPDs by 2020. Progress has been substantial but uneven: full immunization coverage--defined as children aged 12-23 months who received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and measles vaccines and three doses each of polio and pentavalent vaccines--reached 89.1% in Punjab but only 47.1% in the northeastern state of Assam.61Various factors, such as quality of public health facilities, level of education, and infrastructure, contribute to these disparities, with large differences in coverage between urban and rural areas.62,63Although the benefits of vaccination have been widely studied in terms of reductions in morbidity and mortality for patients, there is little research on its effect on antibiotic use in India. Our results indicate a negative relationship between monthly lagged vaccine consumption and monthly antibiotic consumption after a period of 32 months.

"vaccine consumption and monthly antibiotic consumption after a period of 32 months. However, this analysis was exploratory and limited by data availability. Further research, such as cohort-based studies of vaccination and antibiotic use in children and comparisons of antibiotic use after the rollout of new vaccines, should examine long-term secular trends and will further refine our understanding of vaccination as a potential mitigator of antibiotic consumption in India. Furthermore, changing patterns of health care-seeking and the role of vaccines in specific antigens, coverage levels, and population groups must be considered as inappropriate antibiotic use continues. Vaccination must be used in tandem with other approaches, such as stewardship programs, to control infections and lower antibiotic use.Funding statementThis work was supported by the Value of Vaccination Research Network (VoVRN) through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1158136).

"AbstractWith the application of electricity information acquisition system and the gradual improvement of related functions, the management on line-loss in intelligent distribution area operated by power supply enterprises has made great progress. However, due to the influence of the subjective and objective factors, the line-loss management has not reached the expected target, which directly affects the economic benefit of power supply enterprises. This article mainly introduces a new management technique of line-loss in intelligent distribution area based on electricity information acquisition system. The abnormal loss of electric energy in intelligent distribution area caused by the current with unbalanced three-phase and the meter connection mode is mitigated.1 IntroductionThe line-loss management of intelligent distribution area is a management method for the statistical analysis of the electric energy loss in the public distribution power supply range [1,2]. In recent years, it has been carried out along with the promotion of urban power grids, rural power grids, as well as the energy consumption reduction project.At present, the main problems that affect the energy loss in intelligent distribution area have converted to the loss of management, which includes the unclear relationship among users, electricity stealing，the unbalanced three-phase, and the meter connection mode [3,4].The line-loss ratio is a comprehensive core economic indicator for power supply"
"converted to the loss of management, which includes the unclear relationship among users, electricity stealing，the unbalanced three-phase, and the meter connection mode [3,4].The line-loss ratio is a comprehensive core economic indicator for power supply enterprises. Therefore, strengthening the line loss management is a long-term strategic task and systematic project for power supply enterprises [5,6]. With the reformation of electric power system, it becomes more and more important to reduce the line loss. The elaborate line-loss management is a future general trend, and improving the efficiency of line loss management is the most urgent hope for power enterprises [7].Electricity information acquisition system can collect and process users' electricity information with real time monitoring, and it can also achieve automatic acquisition, abnormal measurement monitoring, power-quality monitoring, and other functions [8].2 Influence factors of line loss2.1 Triphase load imbalanceIn power supply system, the unbalanced current in the power grid increases copper loss of electric power lines and transformers, the iron loss of the transformers, but reduces the output of the transformers that even affect the safe operation of the transformers, leading imbalanced three-phase voltage. The unbalanced three-phase power supply does not only lead to the increase of line loss, but also affect the quality of power supply [9].2.2 Incorrect wiring of the ammeterIn low-voltage power"
"of the transformers, leading imbalanced three-phase voltage. The unbalanced three-phase power supply does not only lead to the increase of line loss, but also affect the quality of power supply [9].2.2 Incorrect wiring of the ammeterIn low-voltage power distribution area, there are some issues. For example, the zero curve and live wire of single-phase ammeter are in reverse (L/N in reverse), and the wiring sequence of three-phase meter is wrong (reverse-phase sequence). These problems make the collection system cannot collect the actual power of users, which can increase line loss.2.3 Incorrect user membershipThe user membership errors often appear in the city network platform, especially in the new enabled district. The main reasons are as follows.(i) User data are not maintained effectively. The user membership files in the system have long been neglected in effective maintenance and management.(ii) Carelessness of the staff of business expansion causes the new users to fall into the neighbourhood.(iii) The information between operation-maintenance and marketing is not shared.(iv) The public electricity section of the new enabled district is part of the chaos [10].The above problems result in inaccurate user files in the collection system, which will affect the line loss in the intelligent distribution area and lead to abnormal line loss.2.4 Line leakageIt is very difficult to analyse the main reason of the daily line loss through the acquisition system.

"collection system, which will affect the line loss in the intelligent distribution area and lead to abnormal line loss.2.4 Line leakageIt is very difficult to analyse the main reason of the daily line loss through the acquisition system. After excluding the user's stealing factors, the line operation and maintenance personnel should carefully inspect the route of the station to find out line leakage, which is usually caused by external forces. It is mentioned in the literature [10] that whether there is a leakage phenomenon in the circuit by measuring whether the zero curve is charged. It can be served as a reference. The leakage of the line will result in the power supply of the platform far less than the power supply, which can lead to the high line loss of the intelligent distribution area.2.5 Electric larcenyThis kind of problem generally occurs in the area where the user is more dispersed and the telegraph poles are used for distribution. It is usually a structure change in the measurement circuit to steal electricity. The bogus lead seal is hard to determine the authenticity with the naked eye.The clamp ammeter should be used to measure whether the current value of the incoming line is consistent with the current value shown by the LCD display for judgment.It can also be judged by the opening record of the measuring device recorded in the collection system [11]. Focus on the results, electric larceny can reduce the effective output of electricity, which leads to the"
"shown by the LCD display for judgment.It can also be judged by the opening record of the measuring device recorded in the collection system [11]. Focus on the results, electric larceny can reduce the effective output of electricity, which leads to the high line loss.2.6 User's consumption data collection failedIt is mainly caused by the fault of the meter or the fault of the collection communication module. Due to the failure of user data collection, the data is less than the actual data, which leads to the increase of line loss [11].3 New control measures for line loss3.1 Accurate algorithm for line loss based on unbalanced three-phase loadWhen the three-phase load is unbalanced, there is an electric current on the zero curve which produces zero curve power loss. This makes the total power loss of the three-phase four-wire circuit more than the three-phase four-wire balance power supply line. Assuming thatIA>IB>IC,I0≠0,β1=IB/IA,β2=IC/IA. The values ofβ1,β2reflect the imbalance of the three-phase load current. Assuming that the coefficient of unbalance loss isα, and it represents the multiple of theoretical linear loss value when the three-phase load current in three-phase four-wire system is unbalanced. Theoretical calculations draw the following conclusions:(1)Ifαin (1) is introduced into the theoretical line loss formula of three-phase circuit, the power loss of three-phase four wire system can be expressed as:(2)where ΔPrepresents loss power;Ipjrepresents average load"
