"were also conducted.We purposively selected the Greater Accra and the Upper West regions for the conduct of this study based on the Ghana Statistical Service data that showed that Greater Accra is the most urbanised region in Ghana (90.5% urbanisation) with the lowest aggregate poverty levels (12% poverty prevalence), whereas Upper West is the least urbanised region in Ghana (16.3% urbanisation) with some of the highest aggregate poverty levels (88% poverty prevalence) in the country11,12. The two extremes of rural and urban were chosen to assess the theory that variations in PIH across Ghana may in part be explained by urbanisation and the accompanying lifestyles changes that favour the development of obesity.Within each region, the inclusion criteria for districts in the study were that the district should have a district hospital and the hospital management team should agree to participate in the study. Out of 11 districts in the Upper West Region, eight met the inclusion criteria and formed the sampling frame. Five districts were randomly selected through balloting. Of the 16 districts in the Greater Accra Region, nine met the inclusion criteria and constituted the sampling frame out of which five were randomly selected through balloting. The selection of five districts per region was based on resources available to conduct the study and the need to have a minimum of four units of randomisation (district with a district hospital) in each region.Within each district, the"

The selection of five districts per region was based on resources available to conduct the study and the need to have a minimum of four units of randomisation (district with a district hospital) in each region.Within each district, the inclusion criteria for women in the study were being pregnant, and presenting with normal BP at the district hospital ANC visits before 20 weeks of gestation for a routine antenatal rather than a referred antenatal visit. Pregnant women in the selected districts with pre-existing hypertension or who developed hypertension before 20 weeks of gestation were excluded. The primary outcome measure, PIH, was defined as systolic BP (SBP) of 140 mmHg or more and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mmHg or more on at least two occasions, 4 hours apart, and present for the first time after 20 weeks of pregnancy13.Data on pregnant women who attended the health facility from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012 were extracted from the antenatal and maternity registers and recorded on a checklist. These registers are facility level summary listings of key clinical variables and information on all pregnant women who have used the ANC and delivered at their facility.

"age, fundal height, weight and BP at first and subsequent antenatal visits were obtained from the antenatal register. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the squared height in metres of the woman. Data on mode of delivery, and delivery outcome was obtained from the maternity/delivery register. We also searched the laboratory registers of the hospitals to obtain data on urine testing for protein and the delivery records and nurses notes for data on BP measurements at delivery.Data analysisData were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM Corporation, New York City, USA, 2011). We compared characteristics of pregnant women from the Upper West and Greater Accra regions. Data on categorical variables were presented by frequencies and percentages. Continuous data were presented as means with standard deviation (SD).Student'st-test was used to assess whether there were significant differences in means between the pregnant women in the two regions and reported significant with aP-value of <0.05. The WHO BMI classification of underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5-24.9, overweight 25.0-29.9 and obese ≥30 was used to categorise women in the study14. Chi-squared test was used to assess differences in categorical variables between the two regions.

Analysis of covariance was used to test whether there were differences in BMI, SBP and DBP between districts and the regions after adjusting for gestational age. To estimate the incidence of PIH, the numerator was the number of pregnant women who developed PIH and the denominator was the total number of pregnant women in the study. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between BMI and PIH and expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence interval.Ethical approvalEthical approval for the study was given by the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee and by the hospitals.ResultsRoutine HMIS data availability and completenessKey variables needed to assess the incidence of PIH were collected by all hospitals participating in the study. There was however variation in the completeness of the recordings. Age, parity, BP at ANC, weight and height records were 95-100% complete in the facility-based records. Completeness of data on BP at delivery, fundal height and gestational age at first visit varied across districts. Urine protein was not recorded in most of the hospitals.

There was a significant difference between the mean BMI of women in Upper West [22.4 kg/m2(SD 2.9)] and those in Greater Accra [24.7 kg/m2(SD 4.7)],P< 0.001. About 13.9% (n= 212) of women in Greater Accra were obese compared to 2.2% (n= 24) in the Upper West region (P< 0.001).

The difference in the incidence of PIH between Greater Accra region and Upper West region was statistically significant (P< 0.001) as was the incidence of PIH between all the districts. Because of the incompleteness of data on BP at delivery, incidence of PIH manifesting for the first time at delivery could not be estimated and therefore also overall incidence of PIH - both occurring during pregnancy and at delivery could not be estimated.Table 2.Incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension across districts in the Upper West and Greater Accra regions of GhanaRegionDistrictaType of districtRate of PIH (%)95% Confidence IntervalUpper West--3.23.19-3.21LawraRural4.14.07-4.13JirapaRural0.970.96-0.98Wa WestRural0.650.64-0.66NandomRural6.56.46-6.54Sissala WestRural5.95.87-5.93Greater Accra--6.16.09-6.11Ledzokuku KroworUrban5.65.58-5.63La DadekotoponUrban9.08.96-9.04Ada EastRural4.34.28-4.32Ga WestMostly urban with rural areas5.85.77-5.83Shai Osu DokuMostly rural but urbanising6.66.57-6.63aSource: GHANADISTRICTS.com accessed atwww.ghanadistricts.com/districtson 20 December 2014.Table3shows that"

"women in Greater Accra corresponded with a higher incidence of PIH in Greater Accra. Urbanisation is among the population changes that have been documented to contribute to the development of overweight and obesity in LMICs. Urbanisation is known to be associated with lifestyle changes such as diet and decreased levels of physical activity that put people at increased risk of overweight and obesity15-19. In 2013, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among women in West Africa ranged from 12.4% in Chad to 55.7% in Mauritania. Ghana registered a prevalence of overweight among women of 38.4% and of obesity of 14.0%18. Higher obesity rates among women (up to 37.1%) have been documented in other studies in the urban Greater Accra region20-22. Apart from the mother, the foetus is also put at risk by maternal obesity, since maternal obesity is a known risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes22-24.Although data on local area variations in PIH incidence in sub-Saharan Africa or even between countries are scarce, data from other parts of the world suggest that it is an area of work that should be further explored in sub-Saharan Africa. Kaajaet al.25documented regional differences in the prevalence of pre-eclampsia in Finland. The Northern, Eastern and Southern parts of Finland had rates of 13.9%, 11.1% and 7.9% respectively.

"The Northern, Eastern and Southern parts of Finland had rates of 13.9%, 11.1% and 7.9% respectively. These regional differences remained significant after adjustment for several maternal factors such as age at first birth, current age, parity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and mothers' myocardial infarction. Differences in pre-eclampsia rates were attributed to the risk factors of coronary artery disease among women in Finland.The incompleteness of critical HMIS data such as BP at delivery limits the strength of the study and therefore our ability to be conclusive beyond doubt from the routine HMIS. Several of the gaps in the HMIS data availability could be attributed to the design of the antenatal and delivery registers, which have not made provision for these variables.There were however a few other reasons for data incompleteness. Although staff were aware of existing protocol requirements, routine dipstick test for urine protein was often not done for pregnant women in the Upper West region because of stock out and non-availability of test kits. In the Greater Accra region routine testing of urine protein was done by the midwives at the ANC. Here too, one clinic reported occasional stock out of urine dipsticks. When this happened, pregnant women were asked to test their urine at private laboratories. In both regions the urine protein results were not recorded in the antenatal register again because it is not one of the variables in the register."
"urine dipsticks. When this happened, pregnant women were asked to test their urine at private laboratories. In both regions the urine protein results were not recorded in the antenatal register again because it is not one of the variables in the register. Where the tests had been done at the hospital's laboratory it was sometimes possible to extract the result from the laboratory register. Yet even this had limitations as most of the laboratories did not have good records of the tests done. In instances in the Greater Accra region where the test was done at private laboratories, the option to confirm from the laboratory register was not available.There were several reasons for the low percentage of fundal height recording even though that variable was in the register. In some clinics the fundal height was simply not recorded in the antenatal register. In other clinics the foetal heart rate was recorded rather than fundal height although the register had a footnote explaining the abbreviation 'fht' as fundal height.Not all health facilities recorded the BP of the women at delivery in the delivery/maternity register because there is no column in the form for it. It was however recorded on the delivery sheets and in the nurses' notes. Accessing these documents was difficult because in some facilities the delivery sheets could not be traced.These challenges can be addressed by changing national level requirements, recognising the importance of PIH in maternal outcomes."
"nurses' notes. Accessing these documents was difficult because in some facilities the delivery sheets could not be traced.These challenges can be addressed by changing national level requirements, recognising the importance of PIH in maternal outcomes. Addressing the gaps in the quality of the routine HMIS is likely to be an effective approach to ensure the needed routine monitoring as well as producing the evidence base related to local area variations in PIH incidence. In the study setting the interventions that need to be put in place to enable the use of routine HMIS data for such purposes are fairly simple and inexpensive and likely to be more cost effective than the use of special surveys. Interventions such as expanding the range of variables that are captured in the antenatal and delivery registers can make a major difference in the quality of the evidence available to inform decision making.Addressing stock-outs and non-availability of urine protein testing strips is also a step that can make a difference not only to data quality but also to the health and outcome of pregnant women and newborns. The policy of allowing pregnant women to take their maternal health record books home was to ensure continuity of care in a setting in which women sometimes move from one clinic to another in the course of a pregnancy; and also where patient records storage is poor in facilities.

"a setting in which women sometimes move from one clinic to another in the course of a pregnancy; and also where patient records storage is poor in facilities. Given that this situation has not changed, key information in the book should be extracted and kept in routine HMIS records of the clinic.This study found statistically significant variations of PIH between districts and between the two regions. Maternal health policies and programmes should pay more attention in collecting evidence on local variations in maternal health conditions and take account of these local variations in the planning and delivery of health services.Using a retrospective record review, the study was limited by the information obtained and recorded in the ANC and delivery registers. Hence detailed risk factor information such as family history of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, chronic hypertension, diabetes, twin pregnancies, and personal lifestyle conditions such as smoking, dietary habits and physical activity could not be ascertained.Our data collection was health facility- rather than community-based. However, it is reasonable to assume that the women in the study are representative of women in the community because the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (Table4) showed that more than 95% of Ghanaian women attend antenatal care8,9.Table 4.Antenatal coverage by socio-demographic variables, Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2003, 2008 and 2014VariableGDHS 2003 [ANC coverage (%)]GDHS"

More attention needs to be given to mapping and understanding local area variations in PIH within countries as well as between countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Possible relationships with urbanisation and lifestyle changes that promote obesity should be investigated in detail to provide information to inform maternal and newborn health policy and programme decisions. This can be done with HMIS data, but interventions need to be put in place to improve the data completeness.

Attention also needs to be paid to quality of antenatal and delivery care inputs such as preventing stock out of reagents to test for urine protein. Despite high antenatal care coverage in the study setting (over 95%) and high skilled attendance at delivery, the quality of the service received can limit the impact on outcomes if these issues are not addressed.AcknowledgementsThis work received financial support from Rockefeller Foundation Grant 2011 THS 332 to support policy development and analysis capacity and strengthen the policy analysis unit of the Ministry of Health, Ghana.

"AbstractIntroduction. Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the globe, and it is a serious illness in developing countries. Typhoid fever is prevalent in Ethiopia, and the burden differs with diverse demography, environment, and climate. The study aimed to determine the incidence of typhoid fever cases by person, place, and time.Method. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the five years (2015-2019) of surveillance data of typhoid fever in the Jimma Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia. The data were extracted from the zonal health management information system database from May to June 2020. SPSS version 21 was used to enter and analyze the data. Descriptive analysis was used to assess the distribution of typhoid fever incidence in time, place, and personal groups.Result. A total of 36,641 individuals suffered from typhoid fever during the five years. Among these, 18,972 (51.8%) were females and 17,669 (48.2%) were males. Incidence of typhoid fever was found as follows: 216, 198, 203, 264, and 299 cases per 100,000 persons were reported during 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Typhoid fever cases were increased by 1.4 from 2015-2019. A high incidence of cases was observed at the start of wet months. The majority of the investigated cases were identified in Kersa, 4,476 (12.2%), Gomma, 4,075 (11.1%), and Mana, 3,267 (8.9%), woredas.

"at the start of wet months. The majority of the investigated cases were identified in Kersa, 4,476 (12.2%), Gomma, 4,075 (11.1%), and Mana, 3,267 (8.9%), woredas. Of the total, 151 (0.4%) of the reported cases were admitted for inpatient care. During the five years of surveillance data, death was not reported from all woredas.Conclusion and Recommendation. Typhoid fever was a major public health problem in the Jimma Zone for the last 5 years, and it was increased through the years. Zonal health departments should strengthen the interventions focused on the woredas that had a high burden of typhoid fever at the start of the wet months.1. IntroductionTyphoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the globe, and it is a serious illness in developing countries. Reports that estimate the global burden of typhoid fever indicate that the disease is still a public health issue. Annually in the globe, there are around 14.3 million typhoid fever cases leading to 135.9 thousand deaths and 9.8 million DALYs. In developing countries, around 12.5 million persons are affected by typhoid fever each year [1,2].Typhoid fever is one of the public health significant diseases in low-income countries such as Ethiopia in which the safety of drinking water supply, hygienic condition, and quality of life are poor and below standard. If left untreated, typhoid fever is a lethal disease where 10-30% of cases will end in death, while with intervention, the case fatality rate will be"
"the safety of drinking water supply, hygienic condition, and quality of life are poor and below standard. If left untreated, typhoid fever is a lethal disease where 10-30% of cases will end in death, while with intervention, the case fatality rate will be dropped to 1-4% [3].In Ethiopia, similar to other low-income countries, there was a challenge to evaluate and determine the burden of typhoid fever cases due to inadequate coverage of studies and a dearth of coordinated surveillance systems in the country. Besides, a low report rate of positive cases and the occurrence of other infectious diseases that gets high importance in the surveillance system may make the problem of typhoid fever appear small by comparison and lack concern [4,5].According to the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) report, two percent of males and three percent of females died because of typhoid fever [6]. Among the symptomatic cases of typhoid fever, around 10-40% will have a risk of complication and death if left untreated. Even from typhoid fever patients who had got treatment, two to five percent will have a risk of death. In Ethiopia, typhoid fever is an endemic- and epidemic-prone disease, especially in the area of highlands in which around 10,000 cases are reported each year. People without a home who live in together with poor hygienic conditions are primarily affected by the disease [7].Thus far, the FMOH has established different intervention strategies for the community to improve"
"10,000 cases are reported each year. People without a home who live in together with poor hygienic conditions are primarily affected by the disease [7].Thus far, the FMOH has established different intervention strategies for the community to improve awareness and risk perception of infectious diseases including typhoid fever through health extension workers. However, the burden of typhoid fever has not been reduced to an acceptable rate [6].Bearing in mind, in Ethiopia, typhoid fever is an endemic disease, and the burden and consequence of the disease vary with different ecology, climate, and population groups. So, communicating the latest new information concerning the distribution of typhoid fever in the catchment area will have valuable significance for early and prioritized interventions [8].Typhoid fever is most common among individuals who work in food handling and preparation activities and overcrowding slums and low-economic-status people because of poor hygiene and waste disposal system. Unless protective and control measures are taken appropriately, the occurrence of typhoid fever outbreaks would be higher [9].A continuous investigation of surveillance data is significant for noticing disease outbreaks, judging disease tendencies, and evaluating the efficacy of disease prevention and control programs. In addition, the surveillance data analysis provides indicative information about the appropriate health resource allocation [10]. Despite the presence of collected"
"tendencies, and evaluating the efficacy of disease prevention and control programs. In addition, the surveillance data analysis provides indicative information about the appropriate health resource allocation [10]. Despite the presence of collected data in the zonal health departments, it is not analyzed by considering the epidemiology of disease distribution which it helps to know the at-risk population, trends over time, and the geographical distribution of the diseases, which in turn helps for appropriate intervention [11]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence and mortality rate of typhoid fever by person, place, and time among the five years (2015-2019) of surveillance data in the Jimma Zone.2. Methods2.1. Study AreaThe surveillance data analysis was employed in the Jimma Zone, which is one of the 20 rural zones in the Oromia Region, located in the southwest of Ethiopia with a distance of 352 km from Addis Ababa. The total area of the zone is 199,316.18 km2, accounting for about 17.2% of the total area of the region (Figure1). Climatically, the zone is classified into three agroecological zones, namely, highlands (14.9%), midlands (21.5%), and lowlands (63.5%). The annual rainfall ranges from 900 ml to 1,400 ml. The annual mean temperature of the zone ranges from 10°C to 25°C, with a mean temperature of 17.5°C. Fifty-three percent of the zone is exposed to malaria, which is a febrile illness that shares similar symptomatology and epidemiology to typhoid"
"1,400 ml. The annual mean temperature of the zone ranges from 10°C to 25°C, with a mean temperature of 17.5°C. Fifty-three percent of the zone is exposed to malaria, which is a febrile illness that shares similar symptomatology and epidemiology to typhoid fever. Both share similar social circumstances that require attention for their transmission [12].Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointMap of the Jimma Zone in the Oromia Region, Ethiopia [13].Administratively, the zone is divided into 21 administrative woredas (19 rural woredas and 2 towns) and 566 kebeles. According to the Ethiopian 2011 population and housing census projection, the total population of the zone in July 2019 was estimated to be 3,425,206 with 1,678,351 males and 1,746,855 females. The average household size in the zone is 4.8, with a population density of 32.1, which greatly varies among zones and woredas. Likewise, the Jimma Zone has 5 hospitals, 122 health centers, 566 health posts, 10 private medium clinics, 101 lower clinics, 31 drug stores, and 41 rural drug vendors.2.2. Study PeriodThe study was conducted among the monthly report of 5-year (January 2015-December 2019) typhoid fever surveillance data, and it was extracted from May to June 2020.2.3.

PopulationThe source populations were all people at risk of typhoid fever in the Jimma Zone, Oromia Region. All the population of the Jimma Zone that visits the health institution under surveillance in the zone and diagnosed with typhoid fever during 2015-2019 was the population of the study.2.5. Eligibility CriteriaIndividuals who visit health facilities under surveillance systems in the Jimma Zone during 2015-2019 were included in the study. Individuals suspected of typhoid fever but with no laboratory confirmation or incomplete record of the outcome variable in the database were excluded from the study.3. Study Variable3.1. Incidence of Typhoid Fever3.1.1. Case Definitions of Typhoid FeverSuspected: a person presented with gradual onset of remittent fever or fever rising in a stepladder fashion in the first week and manifested with arthralgia, loss of appetite, headache, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhea. Confirmed: a suspected case with the Widal test, \"O\" titer of 1/160 and more, and very suggestive of recent infection of typhoid fever or a suspected case with positive blood culture at the 1st week or positive stool culture at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th week of illness which is very definitive"

Data Collection MethodData used for the study were based on the records of the health office of the Jimma Zone municipality. All health facilities under surveillance systems in the Jimma Zone were included in the study. Two experienced field epidemiology professionals extracted data on all typhoid fever cases during the five consecutive years from the zonal health office Health Management Information System (HMIS) databases through a document review checklist. The checklist was adapted from the WHO [3], and its elements included the date of report, age, sex, admission hospitalization, laboratory finding, and final case classification. All typhoid fever cases from 2015-2019 were extracted and used for the study.3.1.3.

"EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for data cleaning and analysis. The data were analyzed and interpreted from July-September 2020. Incorrect records and errors were cleaned before analysis. Descriptive analysis was used to determine the distribution of typhoid fever incidence in different times (months and years), woredas, and personal groups (sex and age category). Incidence rate, percent of cases, and report completeness were computed to describe the results. Typhoid fever incidence was calculated by taking the total number of new cases of typhoid fever and dividing that by the sum of the person-time of the at-risk population in the study area from 2015-2019. Report completeness in this study was measured as the number of reports received from facilities (monthly) divided by the expected number of reports from facilities [14,15]. Textual narration, tables, and graphs were used to describe the results. Finally, the findings of our study were reported as frequency, percentage, and rates.4. Result4.1.

DiscussionThis study assessed the incidence of typhoid fever by person, place, and time among the five years (2015-2019) of surveillance data in the Jimma Zone with a good quality of the report.The total incidence of typhoid fever cases in the five years (2015-2019) was 238 per 100,000 persons. The incidence of typhoid fever in each year was investigated as 216 cases in 2015, 198 cases in 2016, 203 cases in 2017, 264 cases in 2018, and 299 cases in 2019 per 100,000 persons. The result suggested that the burden of typhoid fever cases was increased from 2015 to 2019 with a fluctuating trend, even though different interventions have been implemented in the catchment area.

"and 299 cases in 2019 per 100,000 persons. The result suggested that the burden of typhoid fever cases was increased from 2015 to 2019 with a fluctuating trend, even though different interventions have been implemented in the catchment area. The trend is congruent with a study in Lalo Asabi district, West Wollega, Ethiopia, which was increasing in an instable mode [17]. It could be due to the expansion of hospitals and health centers and health service coverage through the consecutive years in the Jimma Zone, which can investigate an increased number of typhoid fever cases.The result of our study was congruent to the national health and health-related indicator report in the Oromia region and at the national level [18], and it was in line with a study conducted in Africa (Malawi and Seralione) [19], while the findings of this study were lower as compared to a study conducted in Shashemene Hospital and Afar District, Ethiopia [8,11]. The discrepancy could be due to study setting, sample size, and target population difference. The attempt of the healthcare providers including health extension workers in the area or the validity of a diagnostic test could contribute to the variations.This result suggested that the magnitude of typhoid fever rises at the start of wet months (end of the dry season) since the highest burden was observed during March.

"of typhoid fever rises at the start of wet months (end of the dry season) since the highest burden was observed during March. In general, September, October, November, March, and June encountered a high number of typhoid fever cases. Even though typhoid fever cases are detected throughout the year, in endemic areas, the high incidence is mostly reported during summer or wet months [20]. In addition, the seasonality of typhoid fever is supported by a scientific report which argued that, during wet months, a preceding peak of rainfall is associated with the high incidence of typhoid fever cases [21]. The change in timing of rainy seasons was experienced in most parts of the country in which mid-March up to June was the main rainy season and the second rainy season shifted to September to mid-December in Southwestern Ethiopia during recent years [4]. In our study area context, the end of the dry season (the starting of wet months) is the time in which the rural water supply is the lowest and people congregate at the source of water. This may be the start of the rain month, and people living in the rural area utilize runoff water or pond water for drinking and cooking food without water treatment. At this time, the rain helps spread already contaminated water supplies [7]. Therefore, the opportunity of contamination of water with pathogenic organisms is high with the aid of poor sanitation practice [5].The result of this study, concerning the distribution of typhoid fever cases"
"already contaminated water supplies [7]. Therefore, the opportunity of contamination of water with pathogenic organisms is high with the aid of poor sanitation practice [5].The result of this study, concerning the distribution of typhoid fever cases in geographical areas or woredas in the Jimma Zone, concluded that the majority of the investigated cases were identified in Kersa, Gomma, Mana, Sigma, Setema, and Deedo woredas. Typhoid fever is more common in areas with poor sanitation practices [3], so unsafe and inadequate water for drinking and handwashing, especially related to the toilet, could be responsible for the increment of cases in the identified sites. This could generate the chance of transmission of the pathogen from one person to another person.In our study, the admission rate in the five consecutive years was 0.4%, and most of the admitted cases were reported in Gumay woreda (39.7%), even though the incidence of typhoid fever cases in this woreda was lower (3.1%) as compared to that in other woredas. The case fatality rate was zero within 5 years. The morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever in the catchment area were minimal. This could be explained through the increasing awareness and health-seeking behavior, early detection of cases, appropriate diagnosis, and treatment that contribute to the minimization of inpatient cases and the absence of death.Concerning the distribution of typhoid fever in sex, the result of this study showed that females accounted for"
"early detection of cases, appropriate diagnosis, and treatment that contribute to the minimization of inpatient cases and the absence of death.Concerning the distribution of typhoid fever in sex, the result of this study showed that females accounted for 51.8% of cases, which is congruent as we compare to a gender-based analysis of the morbidity report of FMOH EFY, 52% of females encountered the cases, and in the Arba Minch Health Center, 52.3% of typhoid fever cases were females [4,22]. Most (60.8%) of the study subjects that have been affected with typhoid fever were in the age category of above 19 years to 59 years, followed by 13-19 years. On the other side, under-five children and elderly (60 years and above) age groups were less affected. Our result is congruent with a study employed in the Arba Minch Health Center, Southern Ethiopia, which showed that study subjects with the age of 5-15 and 16-30 years were highly affected as compared to study subjects of age less than five years [4]. In addition, a study conducted in Jigjiga, Eastern Ethiopia, showed that the age group of 31-45 was more at risk to have typhoid fever [23]. A five-year study in Hohoe Municipality of the Volta Region, Ghana, argued that adults in the age group of 25-29 years were most affected with typhoid fever [24]. This indicated that adults and adolescent age groups were more vulnerable to typhoid fever infection. However, it was different from other studies which argued that children were more"
"age group of 25-29 years were most affected with typhoid fever [24]. This indicated that adults and adolescent age groups were more vulnerable to typhoid fever infection. However, it was different from other studies which argued that children were more vulnerable to typhoid fever cases [25-27]. This could be due to the proportion of study participants in each age group, geographical location, and others.This study examined typhoid fever incidence indicator data reporting completeness in the Jimma zone health management information system between 2015 and 2019, and it was greater than the standards of the national target (80%) [3]. The study concluded that it has good quality to offer an assessment of typhoid fever incidence.5.1. LimitationMost of the private clinics were not included in this surveillance data analysis because they were not in the government reporting system. In addition, there could be individuals who do not visit health facilities to get care. So, this study might not address all possible typhoid fever cases in the study area. The quality of surveillance data, particularly the consistency, could be affected through the fast expansion of health facilities over time. This implied that the increase of cases over time may not truly indicate the more occurrence of new cases over time; rather, there was a probability to be due to the increase of health facilities or increase of reporting sites.6. ConclusionsTyphoid fever has been an important public health issue"
"time may not truly indicate the more occurrence of new cases over time; rather, there was a probability to be due to the increase of health facilities or increase of reporting sites.6. ConclusionsTyphoid fever has been an important public health issue in the Jimma Zone for the last 5 years, and the increment of typhoid fever case incidence throughout the years was reported. In general, the majority of typhoid fever cases were treated at the outpatient department and few cases were treated at the inpatient department. The highest incidence of typhoid fever cases was reported at the start of wet months, particularly in March, and the distribution of cases was positively skewed to Qarsa, Gomma, and Mana woredas among the surveillance areas. Besides, adults were more vulnerable to typhoid fever.6.1. RecommendationThis study aims to show the incidence and distribution of typhoid fever in different woredas of the Jimma Zone during 2015-2019 and offer evidence for the appropriate management and decision on the strategy for concerned bodies, particularly local health system administrators. Communicating the findings of this study to the governmental and other concerned bodies has valuable significance for early and prioritized interventions.

"So, designing appropriate interventions based on this study's findings and other necessary pieces of evidence has a direct impact on the reduction of typhoid fever occurrence and its consequences in the target population.To avert the burden and consequences of the disease, healthcare providers should deliver intensive health promotion programs such as safe hygienic conditions, particularly handwashing related to cooking, eating, and toilet. Zonal health departments should strengthen the interventions focused on the woredas which had a high burden of typhoid fever at the start of wet months. Private health facilities or clinics must be included in the surveillance reporting system.AbbreviationsEFY:Especially for youthFMOH:Federal Ministry of HealthHMIS:Health Management Information SystemIDSR:Integrated Disease Surveillance ReportPHEM:Public Health Emergency ManagementWHO:World Health Organization.Ethical ApprovalThe study was approved by the Jimma University College of Medicine and Public Health ethical review board.

"AbstractIn order to process the blurred image, this study proposes to combine the blurred point functions in the invariant space into multiple blurred images and then restore them through the deconvolution operation. The PSF functions of the fuzzy invariant space are combined to obtain the fuzzy invariant space. Finally, a gradual restoration method is used to perform many blurred image processing steps. The experimental results prove that the method proposed in this study can avoid the noise introduced in the process of multiple deconvolutions, can reduce the calculation error, and can improve the recovery effect. Based on fuzzy image processing, this research studies the nature of human motion and the identification of actions in the Internet of Things, which provides new ideas and methods for recognition research. The Kinect somatosensory camera of the Internet of Things is used to capture deep images, and 20 three-dimensional points of the human skeleton structure are obtained through its SDK. Based on this, the motion characteristics of human joints were studied, and a motion resolution model suitable for the Internet of Things was proposed. The model has low complexity, simple calculation, and sorting characteristics.

"Based on this, this research study also uses software engineering ideas and general methods of system development to design and create sports dance management information systems and uses advanced methods such as computers and the Internet to maintain training management to achieve optimal sports training for sports dance mode and to provide information about the management of sports dance athletes training to improve efficiency and the management level.1. IntroductionAiming at the processing of blurred images, this study proposes a new method for estimating rotation blur parameters. This method first divides the rotated blurred image into different blocks (average and layer-by-layer block), makes each small block have an approximate angle and blur degree according to linear motion, and finally uses the least square method to estimate the rotation center and angle [1]. The experimental results show that due to the error of the actual value, the rotation center and the estimated angle are very small. At the same time, the errors obtained by incorrectly estimating the image from different block methods are also different, and it is necessary to select a suitable block method according to the actual situation [2]. Finally, this study uses two methods of displacement polar coordinates and improving diagonal load to carry out fuzzy image processing experiments and to obtain ideal recovery results.

"this study uses two methods of displacement polar coordinates and improving diagonal load to carry out fuzzy image processing experiments and to obtain ideal recovery results. Based on this, this study designs a system for distinguishing actions of the Internet of Things [3]. The coordinate data of the secondary integration point were retrieved based on Kinect. According to the structure and distribution of the human skeleton, some joints and skeleton points are selected from the upper limbs, lower limbs, and the central connecting part to form about 22 sets of structural vectors [4]. Since the vector structure is not invariant in expansion and translation, the system further processes this basic data to obtain the characteristics of the action. Finally, 20 sets of angles and 4 sets of modulus ratio information are selected to form a 24-dimensional vector to represent the characteristics of one frame [5]. Any action composed ofnframes is a continuous static assumption, so the system can use 24 n-dimensional vectors to design actions. In addition, the design structure of the sports dance training management information system has also been established [6].The purpose of the system is to determine the optimal mode of sports training and complete the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of raw information of athletes in sports dance training, as well as information about coaches, training plans, influence training, and related sports dance training [7]. The system"
"and complete the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of raw information of athletes in sports dance training, as well as information about coaches, training plans, influence training, and related sports dance training [7]. The system can store and retain data about the sports dance training process, can quickly and accurately perform classification and query information, can effectively obtain training information, and can search for training information according to different conditions [8]. Integrating modern information technology into the management of sports dance training can help managers and coaches. Use advanced technologies such as computers and networks to promote training management and information and automatic management of sports dance training, thereby improving efficiency and management levels [9].2. Related WorkThe literature introduces the overall scheme of a knowledge-based exercise-assisted training. The framework has four main modules, namely, domain knowledge, trainees, performance analysis, and management. The domain knowledge module is a digital representation of the exercise content of the sport, improvement instructions, skill indicators, and more known in the sport [10]. The literature introduces some shortcomings of common methods in image restoration algorithms. In view of the shortcomings of the traditional Wiener filtering algorithm, an improved traditional Wiener filtering algorithm was developed [11]. The data entropy function"
"introduces some shortcomings of common methods in image restoration algorithms. In view of the shortcomings of the traditional Wiener filtering algorithm, an improved traditional Wiener filtering algorithm was developed [11]. The data entropy function is introduced to allow secondary filtering of Wiener images, and experiments show that the algorithm can effectively restore unfocused blurred images [12]. The literature introduces the significance and importance of recognizing human actions, analyzes the ability of applying deep images to recognize actions, and provides basic research ideas for this article [13]. The literature introduces the main technology and architecture of action recognition and focuses on the methods of extracting action forms and selecting various technical details of action recognition. The literature introduces the BP neural network, which analyzes the data obtained from the neural network and uses the test data to test the BP classification algorithm. The trained network parameters are then saved and are named as VS [14]. Finally, six different operations were implemented in the VS2010 software environment for classification and identification.3.

"Algorithm Model3.1. Blurred Image Processing TechnologyImage noise may interfere with signal processing, and it is ubiquitous in the field of image acquisition and processing. Therefore, people often use probability statistics to describe it.Noise characteristics: noise is usually a signal of image degradation (grayscale), and specific statistical characteristics (such as mean and variance) are usually used to describe noise characteristics.Noise source: the noise source in the image is very wide. Noise will inevitably be introduced during image capture and transmission. For example, when collecting images, the amount of light and temperature in the CCD will affect the signal-to-noise ratio of the captured image. When transmitting images, factors such as the quality of the transmission equipment and atmospheric interference may also interfere with the images.Noise is generally divided into two types, namely, the additive noise model and the multiplicative noise model.3.1.1. Additive Noise Model(1)The output waveform of the signal affected by additive noise is the superposition state of the input signal and the noise term, and its characteristic is that the magnitude of the noise is not affected by the magnitude of the input signal.3.1.2. Multiplicative Noise Model(2)The noise multiplication will affect the output signal on both sides.

"signal.3.1.2. Multiplicative Noise Model(2)The noise multiplication will affect the output signal on both sides. The first part is the input signal of the additive noise model, and the second part is different from the additive noise model in terms of noise. It is no longer connected to the input signal, but is determined by the size of the input signal. Therefore, the multiplicative noise model has the following characteristics: as the input signal increases, the noise term also increases. This activity is difficult to calculate and analyze. In practical applications, if the input signal does not change much, then the multiplicative noise model is always evaluated as an additional processing noise model.(3)whereziis the gray value of thespixel andp(zi) is the value of the corresponding normalized histogram. The closest PDF can be adjusted according to the shape of the histogram of the auxiliary images, and then, the mean and variance can be used to solve the necessaryaandb.In the spatial domain, the image is usually expressed as the gray value of each position in a simple and clear way. In many practical applications, after transforming complex spatial problems into a frequency domain, they will become simpler. Frequency domain processing not only helps to capture the image shape but also helps to enhance the understanding and analysis of the concept of image information, thereby helping to solve problems.Suppose that the continuous functionf(x) is sampled atNequidistant"

In this case, the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform can be simplified in the following manner:(7)It can be seen from the abovementioned formulas that the discrete two-dimensional Fourier transform is separable. In addition, the two-dimensional Fourier transform also has translation, periodicity, symmetry, rotation, and linearity, which is equal toF(0, 0) of MN or the average value off(x,y) and other characteristics. These properties are very important in the processing and analysis of digital images.3.2.

"and other characteristics. These properties are very important in the processing and analysis of digital images.3.2. Internet of Things Action Recognition TechnologyThe BP algorithm uses the output layer error to estimate other layer errors directly from the output layer and then uses the error to estimate the previous layer error. In this way, the error estimates for all other layers are obtained and become the final result. The displayed error will be slowly transmitted to the input end of the network, and the input direction is opposite to the input signal. Therefore, people abbreviate this algorithm as reverse reproduction algorithm or BP algorithm. It provides training for multilayer networks in a very effective way. Over the years, the algorithm has received a lot of attention, and the BP (back propagation) neural network has become one of the most commonly used neural network models. The BP network can detect many mapping relationships in the input-output model without revealing the mathematical equations that previously designed these mapping relationships.

Practical Application of Fuzzy Image Processing in the Optimal Mode of Sports Dance Sports Training4.1. Mode Structure DesignThe sports dance training management system is a computer software system used for all functions of the sports dance training team, which is used to manage and supervise training activities. According to the functions of different themes, in the design of the system, these themes are divided into five categories, namely, coaches, coaches, athletes, scientific researchers, and managers, that is, five roles trained by system users.4.1.1. Head CoachThe head coach is the director of the sports dance team and manages the team's coaching staff. The head coach is the user with the highest authority among the system users. The main functions of the head coach include creating accounts for coaches, managers, and athletes; creating accounts at the same level as him; submitting annual and weekly training plans; conducting phase tests of training plans and class hours training plans; and making competition plans.4.1.2.

Their main task in the system is to introduce the training plan, training summary, test results, and competition information at the introductory stage. The annual training plan and competition plan are mainly made by the head coach, while the weekly training plan and training plan during class are made by all coaches.4.1.3. AthletesAthletes refer to the athletes of the sports dance team. The athlete's account is created by the head coach or team leader. After identity verification, the athlete completes the information, checks the training plan, and sends a training summary. Athletes must undergo sports training, and the coach, team leader, and scientific research team will perform activation operations. The above operations are based on the user.4.1.4. Research GroupThe researchers set up a research team that collects data on athletes' physiological and biochemical indicators during training activities and introduces them into processing and statistical systems. The right to edit and view the scientific research team is restricted by the scientific research information team.4.1.5.

ManagerTogether with the head of the sports team, the officers, and other members of the management staff, they are responsible for the management of sports training. They can review the team's training status through the system and play a leading role in managing the training of athletes. The manager is also responsible for managing the center personnel of the project management, senior team leaders, and other personnel who have the authority to supervise and receive the training process of the sports team. Their role is as important as the manager's. The program allows viewing of training plans, training records, competition history, and athletes' technical files in this system. They can also submit game plans, determine game goals, and edit game information.Five different users use different permissions, perform duties, collaborate with each other, and use the sports dance management information system as a means of managing sports training to achieve more accurate and effective information transmission, thereby helping users prepare for management decisions.4.2.

Basic user information should record the user's name, age, ethnicity, and other basic information, as well as historical records such as sports experience, educational experience, and teaching experience. As the main body of system management, information about athlete users should be more detailed, and the main body of athlete information is also an important main body of the main body information management organization. The user's role is the user's authority to use the system. Managers, coaches, and athletes, in the training management process, play different roles in different activities. If they use this management information system, they can also use the information they access and the modules available.

The entire training plan can develop an overall plan for the athlete's career to improve their ability. The entire annual training plan should include a basic preparation phase, a special improvement phase, the most competitive phase, and a competitive continuation phase. Each stage has different training tasks and training loads, and different training goals must be achieved. The multiyear training plan needs to be adjusted and improved according to the actual training situation of the athletes and the needs of the competition. Therefore, the system should be able to manage annual training plans, weekly training plans, and class hours training plans and understand different training plans for different objects. For example, to prepare the same training plan for the entire team and to prepare a unique training plan for a certain athlete, the system can view and update each training plan at any time. It is also necessary to understand the control of training and exercise load and be able to accurately record training tasks and exercise load, and it can supervise the athlete's ability to exercise, so as to rationally perfect the athlete's training tasks and exercise tasks.After exercise, one need to evaluate the effect of"
"load and be able to accurately record training tasks and exercise load, and it can supervise the athlete's ability to exercise, so as to rationally perfect the athlete's training tasks and exercise tasks.After exercise, one need to evaluate the effect of exercise. Whether the effect of training meets expectations is an important feedback indicator for improving the training plan. Evaluation of the impact of training should include all aspects of physical exercise, such as physical exercise, technology, psychology, and sports intelligence. Impact assessment methods can be divided into objective assessment and subjective assessment. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the evaluation stiffness index and use clearer data or annotations to check the effectiveness of the athlete's training. For example, under the method of judging sports dance, the flexibility of sports dance quality can obtain obvious value through endurance and technical exercise level. Tests can be organized regularly to verify the training results of athletes at a specific stage and to evaluate objective indicators of training effects. Subjective evaluation includes coach review and athlete self-evaluation. Coaches can evaluate the subject and write training abstracts, including course abstracts and stage abstracts, depending on the athlete's condition during the training process, the execution of the training plan, and the time required to reach the training goal. Athletes can also write abstracts"
"training abstracts, including course abstracts and stage abstracts, depending on the athlete's condition during the training process, the execution of the training plan, and the time required to reach the training goal. Athletes can also write abstracts and describe the subjects' feelings, evaluate their training, and conduct more detailed self-assessments. In short, the training impact assessment module in the sports dance management information system should allow coaches and athletes to compile training abstracts, compile and review test results, and use training impact assessment methods to develop and modify exercise methods and plans.The purpose and results of the training competition are convincing reasons. Sports training and competition are two influential and closely related relationships. Therefore, the training management information system must integrate information transmission into all aspects of sports training and regard competitive information management as an important part. Information about the athlete's game is also an important part of the athlete's file. The main point of athletes' sports competitions is to record, organize and analyze athletes' competition information, so as to summarize experience and lessons, research and improve training methods, and improve technical levels.4.3.

"and help administrators and coaches use advanced technologies such as computers and networks to promote training management and improve efficiency and management levels. By combining the needs of analysis stage ,we divided the sports dance management information system into six modules, namely, user management module, team management module, training plan management module, result management module training, information management module, and research management module. The frame diagram of the system structure is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointFramework diagram of the management information system for sports dance training.The sports dance training management information system is a comprehensive management system for multilevel users. There are high requirements for the relevance and real-time creation of each link. The design of the computer network system adopts the most popular centralized and distributed processing management system today, and the software in the management information system is stored on the server and the client. The client mainly has a user interface, a local database, and basic tools for data requests. The server function basically stores many data sources, manages data, and shares data.

Data AcquisitionThe information sources in the system are provided by different roles in the process of managing sports dance training, as well as different information related to the training management of different branches. Due to the limited research capabilities of individuals, they can only focus on the selection of key statistical training information. After consulting many documents, conducting research and practice, and discussing with sports dance experts, the data contained in the system was finally identified as basic user information, sports team building, training plans (including annual exercises, weekly plans, and hour plans), phase plan, training summary, test phase plan, test phase results, competition plan, competition results, and data in the research index.

The data flow diagram illustrates the data flow and system processing process, links the entire process together, and accurately shows the connection mechanism between different topics. According to the management process, the data flowchart of the system is divided into the following parts (each data processing node performs data storage during data processing, so the storage legend is omitted), as shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem data flowchart.If the user is in the actual field of view of Kinect, he can actively detect and locate the positions of 20 joint points and display the position information in the form of three-dimensional coordinates (x,y, andz). Kinect can identify the positions of 20 joints on the human body, and their names are shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointNode location and name.Unlike the depth of space, the unit of the bone space coordinate system is meters.

These structure vectors are divided into upper limb structure vector (4), lower limb structure vector (4), trunk structure vector (7), and connection structure vector (7). According to the rules of defining mathematical vectors, the structure of the human body is named according to the principle that the starting point is at the front end and the endpoint is at the back end. The structure of the human body vector is marked with the right elbow⟶right hand in Chinese to facilitate intuitive understanding, where \"⟶\" indicates the direction of the vector. There are 4 sets of vectors in the upper limbs, composed of the arms of two people.

ConclusionImage restoration is widely used in research fields such as remote sensing, military, and medicine. In the process of image receiving and sending, due to various factors (for example, the relative movement of the scene and the camera and the focal length of the lens), the image quality may be degraded.

"length of the lens), the image quality may be degraded. However, in many practical applications, there is a high demand for clear images, which requires the use of image restoration techniques to obtain images that best meet the requirements of practical applications.Based on the analysis of fuzzy image reproduction theory, related technologies such as linear fusion, focus fusion, uniform rotation motion fusion, and multi-image fusion were discussed, and in-depth research and discussion were carried out. Based on this model, this article uses software engineering ideas and general system methods to design and develop an information system for managing sports dance training. The system can effectively store and retrieve data in the process of sports dance training, can quickly and accurately perform classification and query information, and can effectively input training information and retrieve information. Modern information technology has also been fully integrated into the management of sports dance training, which can help managers, coaches, and other personnel use advanced technologies such as computers and networks to promote training management, information, and automated management of sports dance training, thereby improving efficiency and management level.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon"

"AbstractIdentify the treatment effects and risk factors for mortality in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis receiving antituberculosis treatment under the Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) program to reduce the mortality rate of tuberculosis. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on the outcomes of antituberculosis treatment of 7,032 patients with tuberculosis in the DOTS program, in the Tuberculosis Management Information System from 2014 to 2017 in Tianjin, China. The Kaplan-Meier method and multifactor Cox proportional risk regression model were used to analyze the risk factors for mortality during antituberculosis treatment under DOTS. The success rate of antituberculosis treatment was 90.24% and the mortality rate was 4.56% among 7,032 cases of tuberculosis in Tianjin. Cox regression analysis showed that advanced age, male sex, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, first sputum positivity, retreated tuberculosis, and a delayed visit (≥14 days) were risk factors for mortality in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis receiving antituberculosis treatment under DOTS. The treatment effects in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis during antituberculosis treatment under DOTS were positive in Tianjin. Advanced age, male sex, HIV positivity, first sputum positivity, retreated tuberculosis, and a delayed visit (≥14 days) increased the risk for mortality during antituberculosis treatment.1.

"Tianjin. Advanced age, male sex, HIV positivity, first sputum positivity, retreated tuberculosis, and a delayed visit (≥14 days) increased the risk for mortality during antituberculosis treatment.1. IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) is a chronic respiratory infectious disease caused byMycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a major public health problem worldwide. The World Health Organization's 2019 Global Tuberculosis Report indicated an estimated 10 million new patients with TB worldwide, an estimated global TB death toll of 1.24 million, and a mortality rate of 16/100,000 individuals in 2018 [1]. TB remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. At present, China has approximately 900,000 new patients with TB annually, ranking 3rd among 30 countries with high TB burdens worldwide [2]. In 2018, the number of TB-related deaths in China was 37,000 and the mortality rate was 2.6/100,000 individuals, ranking 29th among 30 countries with high TB burdens [1]. Since 1992, China has implemented the modern Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) strategy, which has improved the survival rate of patients and reduced the spread and prevalence of TB [3]. However, in the network reporting system of infectious diseases in China, the number of reported TB cases and deaths ranks high in the epidemiology of class A and class B infectious diseases. TB is the third leading cause of death among major infectious diseases and more than 70% of deaths among patients with TB occur in the"
"the number of reported TB cases and deaths ranks high in the epidemiology of class A and class B infectious diseases. TB is the third leading cause of death among major infectious diseases and more than 70% of deaths among patients with TB occur in the first 2 months of TB treatment [4,5]. Therefore, it is important to explore the risk factors of TB death under the DOTS strategy.TB mortality is an important indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of tuberculosis control and to measure the burden of TB. A TB death-related surveillance system has been established in China. Analyzing and comparing the causes of TB death in information systems is of great significance for selecting the evaluation factors for TB death and predicting epidemic situations of TB deaths. Several studies evaluating the risk factors for death during TB treatment have suggested factors related to age, sex, comorbid conditions, bacteriological status, host immune status, and substance abuse. However, the findings are inconsistent due to differences in the enrolled subjects, the burden of TB in the involved countries, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection prevalence, and socioeconomic status [6-12].This study retrospectively analyzed the effect of supervision and treatment on newly diagnosed TB patients designated hospitals in Tianjin from 2014 to 2017.

The factors influencing the death of TB patients after receiving supervised treatment were analyzed to provide a basis for reducing the mortality of TB.2. Methods2.1. SubjectsThis registration-based cohort study collected data on newly diagnosed and registered patients with TB in the outpatient and inpatient departments of Haihe Hospital, a TB-designated hospital in Tianjin, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. Data from a total of 7,163 patients with pulmonary TB were collected. Pulmonary TB was diagnosed according to the TB Diagnostic Criteria (ws288-2008) and Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Tuberculosis by the Chinese Society for Tuberculosis, Chinese Medical Association, combined with patient past history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory examination results. A total of 131 patients who refused anti-TB treatment, died on the day of diagnosis, changed diagnosis, and were lost to follow-up were excluded; thus, 7,032 cases were finally included as research subjects.2.2. Data SourcesThe basic information of patients with TB included in the study was collected by querying theTuberculosis Information Management System in Chinaand the hospital information system.

"Management System in Chinaand the hospital information system. In China, there is a compulsory nominative notification of all TB cases directly to the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. The medical staff of Tuberculosis Prevention and Control should register patients diagnosed with TB within 24 hours. The information system mainly includes the following content: sex, age, nationality, occupation, treatment classification (primary and secondary treatment), sputum smear results at the time of diagnosis, time from symptom appearance to diagnosis, time from diagnosis to treatment, presence of pulmonary cavities, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results, drug resistance, treatment plan, anti-TB treatment period, and prognosis of patients with TB. These data did not involve epidemic data or compromise the personal privacy of specific patients with TB.2.3. Treatment PrinciplesAccording to the requirements of the \"Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases\" and the Guidelines, DOTS control strategy and follow-up management were implemented by TB prevention and control personnel. The patients were followed up monthly by telephone or home visits. According to theGuidelines, the patients regularly visited the designated hospital for follow-up examinations, including sputum smear, sputum culture, chest imaging, blood routine tests, and liver and kidney function assessment.

The study result was death during the follow-up period, including all-cause death.The requirements of theGuidelinesfor the supervision of the treatment period are as follows. (1) Patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB are generally supervised for 6 months; if the sputum smear test results of newly smear-positive pulmonary TB patients remained positive at the end of 2 months, the intensive treatment is extended for 1 month and the treatment is supervised for 7 months. (2) Patients with retreated pulmonary TB were generally supervised for 8 months; those who could not use streptomycin were provided 1 month of intensive treatment and 9 months of supervised treatment. If the retreated smear-positive pulmonary TB patients remained positive for sputum bacteria at the end of the second month after treatment, patients treated with the streptomycin regimen should extend the retreatment and intensive treatment for 1 month, with supervised treatment for 9 months, while patients who did not use the streptomycin regimen extend the intensive period of treatment for another month, with the treatment plan unchanged in the continuous period and the supervised treatment for 10 months.

The measurement data are presented as mean ± standard deviation () or median and quartile (M (p25-p75)) according to the data distribution. The classification data were assessed using composition ratios, and the chi square test was used for rate comparisons. This study included all patients who met the inclusion criteria and were entered the cohort according to the diagnosis time from 2014 to 2017. Ten variables were analyzed, including age, sex, ethnicity, patient type, first sputum bacteria results, pulmonary cavity, HIV status, drug resistance results, patient delay, and diagnosis delay."
"cohort according to the diagnosis time from 2014 to 2017. Ten variables were analyzed, including age, sex, ethnicity, patient type, first sputum bacteria results, pulmonary cavity, HIV status, drug resistance results, patient delay, and diagnosis delay. The sample size of 7032 with 321 end events is enough according the rule of thumb that Cox models should be used with a minimum of 10 events per predictor variable (EPV) [13,14].The survival probability of patients during TB treatment was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine factors associated with the risk of death in TB patients. All variables withP< 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate Cox regression model.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For multicollinearity diagnosis of variables, the tolerance of all independent variables greater than 0.1 and the variance inflation factor (VIF) less than 10 indicate that there was no multicollinearity among independent variables. For the categorical variables, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve method was used to test the hypothesis was met and to determine whether the survival curve was crossed.

The inspection levelαwas set to 0.05 (two-sided).3. Results3.1. Subject CharacteristicsFrom January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, 7,163 patients with TB were diagnosed and registered in the outpatient and inpatient departments of our hospital. A total of 131 patients (1.82%) were excluded because of treatment refusal, death on the day of diagnosis, or a change in diagnosis. A total of 7,032 patients received standardized antituberculosis treatment and were included in the evaluation of antituberculosis efficacy. Among them, 4,921 (69.98%) were male and 2111 (30.02%) were female; the average age was 50.12 ± 19.99 (range: 12-101) years. There were 5,638 cases (80.18%) of initial TB and 1,394 cases (19.82%) of retreated pulmonary TB. Sputum smear positivity was found in 3,302 cases (46.96%), and sputum smear negativity were found in 3,730 cases (53.04%). A total of 1,476 patients (20.99%) had"

A total of 1,476 patients (20.99%) had cavities in the lungs, and 5,556 patients (79.01%) had no lung cavities. Nineteen (0.27%) patients were HIV positive, and 7,013 (99.73%) were HIV negative. The results showed that 902 patients (12.83%) had developed multidrug resistance (MDR) and 6,130 patients (87.17%) were drug sensitive. A total of 321 (4.56%) patients died and 6,711 (95.44%) survived; 50.47% (162/321) of the patients died in the intensive period 2 months of the treatment.3.2. Analysis of the Effect of Standardized Antituberculosis Treatment in the Period of Supervision and Follow-UpThe outcomes of antituberculosis treatment in the 7,032 patients were as follows: 6,346 (90.24%) were successfully treated, 321 (4.56%) died, 40 (0.57%) were lost, 99 (1.41%) failed, 189 (2.69%) developed MDR, 4 (0.06%) discontinued the treatment because of adverse reactions, and 33 (0.47%) had other outcomes. The success rates of antituberculosis treatment in smear-positive and smear-negative patients were 85.43% (2821/3302) and 94.51% (3525/3730), respectively, both of which exceeded 85%, thus achieving the expected treatment goals.During DOTS treatment, 321 patients died, and the mortality rate was 4.56%.

The results showed that the main risk factors for death during antituberculosis treatment were advanced age, male sex, HIV positivity, first sputum bacteria positivity, retreated TB, and patient delay ≥14 days. The differences were statistically significant (P< 0.05), as shown in Table3. The risk of death increased 1.059 times with each year of increase in age. Advanced age was associated with a higher risk of death. The risk of death was 1.847 times higher for male patients, 3.514 times for patients with HIV positivity, 1.892 times for patients with first sputum bacteria positivity, 1.343 times for patients with retreated TB, and 1.386 times for patients with delayed visit ≥14 days. The calculated tolerance was 0.593-0.998 and the variance inflation factor was 1.002-1.685, indicating the lack of multicollinearity between the variables.

DiscussionIn order to effectively treat and manage patients with TB, the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease introduced the DOTS strategy in the 1970s-1980s [15]. The main evaluation indicators of the effect of TB chemotherapy are generally the negative conversion rate of sputum bacteria at the end of the strengthening period, the cure rate of patients, and the success rate of treatment. The prognosis of patients with TB has mostly been described directly and simply without considering the influence of multiple factors on the DOTS strategy and patients' living conditions. Survival analysis combines the outcomes of the event and follow-up time [16].Among the 7,032 patients with pulmonary TB who completed DOTS treatment, the success rate of treatment was 90.2%, and the success rates of antituberculosis treatment"
"conditions. Survival analysis combines the outcomes of the event and follow-up time [16].Among the 7,032 patients with pulmonary TB who completed DOTS treatment, the success rate of treatment was 90.2%, and the success rates of antituberculosis treatment of patients with smear positivity and smear negativity were 85.4% and 94.5%, respectively. A total of 321 patients died during treatment, with a mortality rate of 4.6%, which was higher than those in Kaili City (2.1%) and Guangzhou (2.8%) [17], but lower than those in Ethiopia (12.71%) [18], India (6%) [19], and Nigeria (16.6%) [20]. The 1-year survival rate was 94.1% after antituberculosis treatment, and the greatest reduction in the cumulative survival rate was observed in the 2 months of antituberculosis treatment. Fifty percent of the deaths occurred at this stage, which is consistent with the results of other studies [5,21,22]. It was reported that 20.5% of the deaths occurred in the first 2 months of antituberculosis treatment [22]. A study in northwest Ethiopia showed that 57% of the deaths occur in the intensive phase of TB treatment [5]. The median survival time from the initiation of treatment to death in this study was 1.9 months, which is consistent with the median survival time of 2 months in two studies in Ethiopia [5,21].In the multivariate Cox analysis, the mortality risk of male patients was 1.8 times higher than that of female patients (RR = 1.847, 95% CI = 1.387-2.459). This finding is consistent with the"
"survival time of 2 months in two studies in Ethiopia [5,21].In the multivariate Cox analysis, the mortality risk of male patients was 1.8 times higher than that of female patients (RR = 1.847, 95% CI = 1.387-2.459). This finding is consistent with the results reported by Zenebe and Tefera [23] and Babalik et al. [24]. The higher risk of male deaths is due to the high pressure, increased participation in social activities, high labor intensity, excessive smoking and alcohol consumption, and poor resistance. However, studies have also shown that there is no significant difference in the survival rates between sexes [18]. Age is a risk factor for the survival of patients with TB. The risk of death increases by 5.9% (RR = 1.059, 95% CI = 1.051-1.067) with each year of increase in age, which is consistent with the results of other studies [18,19,25]. This finding may be related to low immunity, atypical symptoms, long onset time, more basic diseases, and poor health awareness in elderly patients. Therefore, we should strengthen TB screening in the elderly to achieve early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.Patient delays refer to more than 14 days between the onset of patients' clinical symptoms and the first visit to a medical institution. Diagnosis delays refer to more than 14 days between patients' first visit to a medical institution and the diagnosis of TB [26].

"a medical institution. Diagnosis delays refer to more than 14 days between patients' first visit to a medical institution and the diagnosis of TB [26]. This study showed that a risk factor for TB-related death was the visit delay, which led to 1.4 times (RR = 1.386, 95% CI = 1.096-1.753). The Cox regression model showed that a delay in diagnosis did not affect the survival of patients with pulmonary TB. This finding is different from those observed in the context of real-life settings and experiences [27]. This may be because TB is a chronic respiratory infectious disease and a delay of diagnosis of more than 14 days did not increase the risk of death in patients in the treatment period. In addition, the medical level of Tianjin is relatively high, especially the application of advanced TB gene diagnosis technology in recent years, which eliminates the fundamental impact of diagnosis delay on mortality in the pulmonary TB treatment period. Early detection and treatment are advocated for TB prevention and treatment to improve the prognosis and quality of life.Coinfection with HIV promotes the progression and deterioration of TB and leads to rapid death. Many studies have shown that the mortality risk for such patients is high [18,20,28]. HIV/TB coinfection can accelerate the reduction in immune resistance and increase the risk of TB incidence and death. Patients with sputum smear positivity not only have a large amount of bacterial discharge and strong infectivity but also"
