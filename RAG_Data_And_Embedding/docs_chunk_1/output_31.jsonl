It establishes basic personnel information, skills identification information, high-skilled talent management, competence, key research teams, a highly skilled talent information management system with modules such as reports, comprehensive query, and system maintenance. By testing the system, it is concluded that the system can meet the needs of users and enterprises. It can meet the corresponding requirements in many aspects such as functionality, reliability, software design, compatibility, and security. The realization of the electronicization of the basic information of skilled personnel has played an important role in regulating the professional management of skilled personnel and improving the management efficiency of skilled personnel.2. Proposed Method2.1. Multisensor Information Fusion2.1.1. Characteristics of Multisensor Information FusionMultisensor information fusion is a simulation of the human brain system. It reflects many basic characteristics of human brain function. But it is not a true portrayal of the human brain nervous system, it is to simplify and abstract it [9]. It processes information by simulating the way a brain multisensor information fusion processes memory information."
"of human brain function. But it is not a true portrayal of the human brain nervous system, it is to simplify and abstract it [9]. It processes information by simulating the way a brain multisensor information fusion processes memory information. Its characteristics are the following:(1)Nonlimiting.A multisensor information fusion can usually do calculations in the process of information transmission and can also store it. This source is formed by the connection of multiple neurons. The prediction of a certain behavioral result of the system requires the interaction and interconnection of multiple neurons, which mimics the characteristics of human neural connections, so that the operation efficiency is very high, which is the advantage of multisensor information fusion(2)Nonlinear.The wisdom of the brain is a nonlinear phenomenon. It is a parallel structure and processing order. According to mathematical theory, the two states of activation or inhibition of artificial neurons are what people call excited or unexcited states, so they are understood as a nonlinear relationship(3)Nonconvex.Multisensor information fusion under certain conditions, a certain state function changes, and a system state will also change. Multisensor information fusion is the same. A state function has multiple extreme values, and the system also has multiple stable states. The information is not only stored in a unit; there may be multiple evolution directions of the system. This is that multisensor"
"information fusion is the same. A state function has multiple extreme values, and the system also has multiple stable states. The information is not only stored in a unit; there may be multiple evolution directions of the system. This is that multisensor information fusion has a relatively strong fault tolerance feature(4)Very Qualitative.Multisensor information fusion has the ability to self-organize, self-learn, and adapt, which is very similar to the human brain. Therefore, if the final output is incorrect, the system will also add weights to produce new results, and there are multiple changes in the information to be processed. People often use iterative processes to represent the process evolution of dynamic systemsAccording to these four characteristics, multisensor information fusion has been applied to a variety of fields: in the information field, multisensor information fusion for nonlinear signal processing and adaptive signal processing [10], for example, spectrum estimation and noise cancellation. It can also be applied to pattern recognition, such as handwritten Chinese character recognition function and fingerprint recognition system in smartphones [11]. In the field of automation, intelligent monitoring and detection of comprehensive indicators such as environmental comfort are often used in daily life [12]. In the engineering field, such as the optimization of automobile fuel consumption rate and smoke exhaust degree, dense steel decentralized storage, voice"
"of comprehensive indicators such as environmental comfort are often used in daily life [12]. In the engineering field, such as the optimization of automobile fuel consumption rate and smoke exhaust degree, dense steel decentralized storage, voice switch, fingerprint switch function [13]. In the economic field, credit analysis and accurate and objective evaluation results can be obtained based on key data to reduce financial risks. At the same time, the performance of stock trends is particularly outstanding. It can build a more accurate and reliable stock market model based on a variety of factors and determine the future price trend [14].Multisensor information fusion has developed rapidly over the years in the field of computational intelligence, which is characterized by simulating biological multisensor information fusion and learning from nature. Three branches of multisensor information fusion, evolutionary computation, and fuzzy logic have been formed, which provide new ideas, theories, and methods for the research and development of computer science and many disciplines. The organic combination of multisensor information fusion, evolutionary computing, and fuzzy logic to creatively solve complex problems belonging to the category of image thinking has become a research hotspot in computational intelligence and its applications [15].The emergence of multisensor information fusion has changed the application of computers in many aspects. The main features of a computer"
"the category of image thinking has become a research hotspot in computational intelligence and its applications [15].The emergence of multisensor information fusion has changed the application of computers in many aspects. The main features of a computer are a centralized structure, a serial execution of a sequence of instructions, and a storage component separated from a computing component. During information processing, the problems to be implemented need to be programmed and executed by the computer. The problems must be structured problems that can be accurately expressed; otherwise, the computer will not be able to handle them [16]. The traditional artificial intelligence expert system has initially solved this problem, but it is based on planning. It requires people to clearly express their knowledge in advance. Only when the computer centrally stores these knowledge and rules summarized through human wisdom, it has intelligence. So in essence, the traditional artificial intelligence only makes logical reasoning in the form of simulating the human brain from the aspect of external functions. Multisensor information fusion is another sublimation on the basis of the former two. It is a network structure composed of a large number of parallel nonlinear processing units through connection rights, so it simulates part of the image thinking of the human brain from the internal structure. As a result, the ability to solve some non-linear and unstructured problems has become"
"number of parallel nonlinear processing units through connection rights, so it simulates part of the image thinking of the human brain from the internal structure. As a result, the ability to solve some non-linear and unstructured problems has become stronger and has been proven in many already implemented systems.On the other hand, there are still some deficiencies and problems in the application of multisensor information fusion. First, for large-scale distributed systems, the execution time of multisensor information fusion is almost proportional to the square of the number of nodes. Considering the response time of the system, the computer is required to have a high operating speed, so the hardware requirements are very high, and sometimes special hardware is required, and the corresponding cost will be greatly increased. Therefore, hardware research is also an aspect of multisensor information fusion technology. Second, from the characteristics of the multisensor information fusion described above, it can be seen that modifying permissions in the network is a very complicated machine learning process. The network itself cannot give the reason for the output results; it just gives a mapping from the input space to the output space. The information processing process is a black box, and the knowledge distribution is stored in the connection right, so as information storage, the entire network after learning must be stored [17]. In addition, the learning algorithm converts"
"space. The information processing process is a black box, and the knowledge distribution is stored in the connection right, so as information storage, the entire network after learning must be stored [17]. In addition, the learning algorithm converts the input and output problem of the example into a nonlinear optimization problem. There is a local minima problem in mathematics. It is likely that the system will fall into a local minima. No matter how many iterations, the error is decline. So at present, the improvement of learning algorithms is still one of the research directions of multisensor information fusion. In addition, the widening of application fields is also one of the research directions. Experts in many fields have tried to use the idea of multisensor information fusion to achieve problems such as prediction, evaluation, identification, and analysis, which have improved the development of productivity in various fields [18].2.1.2. BP Multisensor Information FusionThe BP learning algorithm generally consists of an input layer, a thousand intermediate layers, and an output layer, and each layer performs function mapping with weights. As shown in Figure1, a number of factors, that is, the function independent variable is set as the input layer, and the corresponding output value is obtained by calculating the intermediate layer weights and adjusting the function. The corresponding error is obtained by comparing the output value with the actual value in the sample"
"is set as the input layer, and the corresponding output value is obtained by calculating the intermediate layer weights and adjusting the function. The corresponding error is obtained by comparing the output value with the actual value in the sample value. The error value is adjusted by the back-propagation of the multisensor information fusion to adjust the weights and adjustment functions of the middle layer, and the model is adjusted to an acceptable error range.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBP-ANN model structure.The input variables arexj, the output variables areθk,wki, andwijare the weightsθiandakof the network connection as the node thresholds, andf(x) represents the excitation function of the network.During the forward propagation of the signal, the input of theith node in the middle layer is(1)The output of theith node in the middle layer is(2)The input of thekth node of the output layer is(3)The output of thekth node of the output layer is(4)During the back-propagation of errors, the back-propagation adjusts the weight value through the output error, so that the output continuously tends to the expected value.

"correction value by inverse calculation(7)The multisensor information fusion can implement the nonlinear mapping process without considering the interference and correlation coefficients between various influencing factors of the input layer. There is no bottleneck that the computer cannot calculate within the effective time due to NP difficulties. With the help of computer programming, fast-convergent computing power can be achieved.2.2. Highly Skilled TalentsHigh-skilled talent is a dynamic, historical category. With the changes of the times and the adjustment of the industrial structure, its connotation and extension have continued to develop [19]. At the current stage of our country, high-skilled talents refer to between the leadership and decision-making level and the technical operation level. Mainly refers to having solid professional theoretical knowledge, mastering contemporary high-level application technology, strong hands-on ability, superb ability, and technology in key skill areas, and being able to independently solve difficult technical and operational problems in this field; highly skilled talents promote technology. Progressive translators put scientific research results into practice. They are a group of compound application-oriented talents who fully meet the needs of the society [20]. Its main characteristics are embodied in complexity, professionalism, practicality, innovation, and modernity [21,22].Through specialized training and training,"
"a group of compound application-oriented talents who fully meet the needs of the society [20]. Its main characteristics are embodied in complexity, professionalism, practicality, innovation, and modernity [21,22].Through specialized training and training, high-skilled personnel have mastered the current high-level applied technology, skills, and theoretical knowledge and have high-quality employees with innovative ability, entrepreneurial ability, and ability to independently solve critical problems [23]. With the continuous improvement of the high-skilled talent growth environment and incentive and guarantee mechanism of the group company, the skilled talent team has continued to grow in recent years. Every year, the graphic and textual materials retained by skilled personnel in terms of training, use, and evaluation are mostly based on raw paper, and the number is constantly increasing. In addition, most of the business offices of group companies have inconvenience in consulting and statistically reviewing a large amount of historical data, and lack of electronic files for changes in skilled personnel. To this end, research and design high-skilled talent information management system to grasp the construction and development of skilled talents, understand the changes of skilled talents, and build a large database of skilled talents information based on the intranet of the group company.

Collect high-skilled talent information globally, realize unified information management and resource sharing, timely grasp the changes in the basic data of the skills of employees in all units, make a reserve of skilled talent resources, and improve the management of statistics, query, and evaluation of high-skilled talents.2.3. Information Management SystemThe construction of an information management system plays an increasingly important role in the economic activities of enterprises. The application of our country's information management system is developing in a large-scale and networked direction. At the same time, information management technology is also continuously automated and intelligent. However, the traditional information management system still stays in the simple classification and storage of data in the form of tables. It has a low degree of intelligence and low information utilization efficiency. It does not really realize the functions of forecasting, decision-making, and optimization. Meet the needs of enterprise development [24].An information management system (IMS) is a system composed of people, computers, and other related equipment.

"[24].An information management system (IMS) is a system composed of people, computers, and other related equipment. It is mainly used to manage the information required by users. It has data processing and auxiliary decision-making functions and is an information system for management services [25]. Like other disciplines, the information management system also has a process of continuous development and improvement, and various references have different opinions on its origin. Early IMS was limited by computer software, hardware, and network communication technology at that time, and many of them were developed based on CP-ALN. In this system mode, the database is built on the file server, but the database management system and database applications are still running on the workstation (usually the CP machine). The performance of servers and workstations in this type of system is difficult to make full use of the network transmission speed is very slow, and it is easy to cause network bottlenecks. When developing IMS, you can only consider more workstations with poor performance. Various IMS development standards are not unified, it is difficult to exchange information with the outside world, and it is impossible to use today's rich Internet resources. Because the traditional IMS development cycle is long and difficult to develop; if the user's needs change, it is difficult to modify the system to meet new requirements. Traditional IMS can only deal with narrowly defined"
"today's rich Internet resources. Because the traditional IMS development cycle is long and difficult to develop; if the user's needs change, it is difficult to modify the system to meet new requirements. Traditional IMS can only deal with narrowly defined information such as finance, sales, and inventory and cannot handle nonbusiness broad information such as internal management information, corporate culture information, and daily administrative communication of enterprises. It is inconvenient to operate, and the user interface is not uniform and not intuitive, which causes inconvenience to use, difficult training, and complicated maintenance [26]. With the rapid development of information technology applications, the inherent disadvantages of traditional IMS have become increasingly prominent. Information technology is developing rapidly, new technologies are constantly emerging, and the requirements of IMS for various parties are constantly increasing [27].With the development of society, the improvement of computer performance and cost reduction, and the improvement of public computer operation skills, the management work of enterprises, institutions, and government agencies will develop in the direction of information, paperless, digital, and network. The popularity of information management systems is and will greatly change our way of life in the future.

"paperless, digital, and network. The popularity of information management systems is and will greatly change our way of life in the future. The information management system can not only complete the basic functions of traditional information systems but also have many functions that traditional information systems cannot achieve, such as information prediction and auxiliary decision-making. Information system security is an issue that information systems must consider, to ensure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information. Information system security planning is a very detailed and very important task. There are many common security threats to information systems, such as information leakage, illegal use, bypass control, counterfeiting, infringement of authorization, theft, and business fraud.In order to meet the needs of the daily management of skilled personnel in the group company, from the perspective of actual management work and functions, the basic unit can guide the basic information and identification information of employees according to the Excel template. When there is an error in the guide data, the basic unit can download the error data and continue to guide after the maintenance is correct. The interface must be beautiful, concise, and easy to operate, and it is convenient for the basic units to maintain data. Facilitate comprehensive query and statistics of skilled personnel data.

It only provides the user interface of the application and is responsible for interacting with the user. The results of various functions in the service layer are displayed in a centralized manner to provide a visual form of the basic services required by the user and the expected results.The service layer is the key to the application system. Responsible for processing all user requests, performing specific calculations, and processing business processes. According to the specific data provided by the data layer, specific functions such as user information management and maintenance, information statistics, and information release are realized. It also manages specific parameter settings during system operation and the interaction between the system and other systems.The data layer stores the underlying data related to system operation, as well as personal information registered by individual users and corporate users.

"model to help companies find talents that meet the quality characteristics of project implementation requirements, in order to avoid the adverse consequences and losses caused by talent errors. When selecting competent high-skilled talents for the project, not only the knowledge and skills should be examined but also the inherent personal qualities such as their personal qualities and role positioning. The influencing factors for determining competence are academic qualifications, professional titles, honors, skills competitions, assessment results, technical papers, and competence levels. The evaluation is classified as excellent (0.9-1), consistent (0.7-0.9), and not consistent (0-0.7). The BP multisensor information fusion algorithm is used here, and the influencing factors are used as the input layer input. The calculation steps of the established multisensor information fusion model are as follows.The selection range of connection weight and threshold is uniformly distributed at (-0.3, 0.3) random numbers; the range of threshold valueθ0,θ1,θ2is (0, 0.3) uniformly distributed random numbers.

Discussion4.1. Design and Implementation of User Login Module and Main Interface4.1.1. Design and Implementation of User Login WindowIn order to improve the security of the information, under the premise of ensuring the security of the system, when setting the user to log in to the system, the user enters a user name and password, and the system will transfer this information to the server for review and verification. The login flow chart is shown in Figure4. All the information entered is correct. If the verification is passed, the system will jump to the next interface, and the user can successfully select the required module for operation. If the user name or password is wrong or one of them is wrong, the system will prompt you to enter the wrong user name and password and keep logged in, as shown in Figure5; if the user forgets the original password, the user can follow the instructions in the password recovery module The original password needs to be restored.

If there are differences, make corresponding adjustments, as shown in Figure7, which is a user login failure graph.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointUser login failure prompt window.By testing the system modules, the test results are the same as the expected results, indicating that the system modules operate normally and can meet the needs of users.4.2.2.

"AbstractAs a new force for online reconstruction, blockchain will bring major changes to resource-sharing activities and information service organizations. The research introduces blockchain and related technologies, provides two basic ways of sharing data sources, and conducts two extensive information source sharing based on blockchain. The article analyzes the various challenges that need to be overcome to implement a blockchain-based information sharing system and suggests that project information service organizations should actively deal with the challenges brought about by blockchain. Experimental research is being conducted on a blockchain-based control system, and a blockchain-based blockchain management system is being developed. On the basis of system analysis and design, the most important functional components of the software system are developed. They include functions such as recording customers, logging in, storing information, printing device information, invoking server-side smart contracts, and conducting audit management. It uses decentralized payments and statistical aggregation of data. The experimental results show that the efficiency of using the blockchain information sharing mechanism in the management system is 35% higher than that of the traditional method, which can more effectively deal with the problem of information delay during the project management process.1.

"management system is 35% higher than that of the traditional method, which can more effectively deal with the problem of information delay during the project management process.1. IntroductionConstruction project management involves the participation of construction units, survey and design, construction contracting, consulting and supervision units, and other subjects. With the increasing scale, complexity, and internationalization of construction projects, the exchange and transmission of information are becoming more and more frequent. The traditional information management mode and means cannot meet the needs of project management, and digitization has become the development trend of construction project management. As structured, information should be shared in an organized environment in some way and used appropriately, efficiently as well as fully. Information sharing is the foundation of the management field and an important goal of information retrieval, transmission, and processing, and therefore immediately became an area of interest. Through the development of social media and the rapid development of IT technology, in recent years, new strategies and new formats of technologies such as the Internet of Things, smart digital, big data, Internet+, and artificial intelligence have emerged.

"smart digital, big data, Internet+, and artificial intelligence have emerged. It affects the methods and functions of shared information systems. Taking advantage of the high-tech technological advancement in the real estate sector, blockchain is widely used in banking, securities, insurance, and other financial institutions, as well as in many fields. The development of the Internet and other companies in the past two years is a catalyst for future changes in the value of the Internet. It will also advance the way information is shared.With the advancement of technology and application development, through the rapid promotion and dissemination of local needs, the rapid development and user participation of blockchain can be understood differently through the knowledge of each individual in the community. It has led to major changes in the creation of information sources, their distribution, intellectual property protection, and public access to information. It will also bring great changes to archives, documentation, and information service organizations. In the past decade, China's information technology industry has grown faster than it has in the same period.

"in the information technology industry continue to increase. The proportion of the information industry in the gross national product has also increased to 12.5%, and the investment has reached 4 trillion yuan. The size of the market should not be underestimated, and it has gradually become a pillar industry in China's important industries. Enterprises are becoming more and more active in their demands for IT technology theory and application.Blockchain originates from Bitcoin, a new payment system and a new digital currency. The blockchain is the underlying technology and infrastructure that supports Bitcoin. Blockchain is through distributed ledger technology (DLT), and it links a series of multiple blocks and records all data shared among each user in a network. These include peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and asymmetric encryption algorithms. Merkel encryption currency in data mining technology and tools hash algorithm timestamp technology, resolution, etc., are both new technologies created by increasing the knowledge of existing information technology or by combining existing information technology with alternative applications. While blockchain is based on Bitcoin, it is independent of Bitcoin for businesses. It can select or create different security systems. And the Bitcoin virtual currency can be interpreted differently.

It is one of the growing Internet trends to have a complete awareness of blockchain-shared databases and shared scripts.The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section2is the related work. Section3demonstrates the information sharing mechanism in project management. The experimental research process, results, and discussion can be found in Section4and Section5. A comprehensive conclusion and future implementation of this research are in Section6.2. Related WorkOlnes et al. believed that as the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain is an open distributed ledger. It records transactions securely, permanently, and efficiently [1]. The purpose of the Iansiti et al. study was to explore the application of blockchain technology in relation to the fourth industrial revolution and to show an example of using blockchain to facilitate machine-to-machine interaction and establish an M2M electricity market in China [2]. Dorri et al. believed that blockchain is a disruptive technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrencies to smart contracts. It is a potential solution to these challenges [3].

"[3]. The central question discussed by Sikorski et al. was whether blockchain technology will lead to innovation and transformation of government processes. To address this issue, the benefits of blockchain technology, which are often exaggerated in the literature, have been critically assessed [4]. Zhou et al. proposed a contracting scheme based on prediction sharing. Under this scheme, GPOs can achieve perfect supply chain coordination in terms of quantity and information sharing. All members in the supply chain can achieve a win-win outcome [5]. Mansfield-Devine mentioned the word \"blockchain\" to most people. Assuming they have heard of it, they are likely to associate it with Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. As a decentralized, cryptographically verified record of transactions, blockchain is the key concept that makes Bitcoin viable [6]. However, the above studies were not convinced by the public due to insufficient data.3.

"[7]. Project management knowledge and its corresponding transformation relationship provide a methodological theoretical basis for studying the composition and connection of project information management knowledge. According to the characteristics of project management, the information sharing characteristics of project management are analyzed. This framework provides a solution for research on sharing project management information [8].It introduces the concept of collaboration to create an information platform for sharing storage and transportation resources through collaborative research. During the research process, the operating system takes blockchain as the core technology. It includes the user-centric application layer system technology, as well as the server-side TomCat server system. The blockchain takes the Ethereum utilities as the core platform. It intercepts the call through the interface, writes the user transaction information into the blockchain, and uses the blockchain to store the data at the end of the database [9]. On the basis of obtaining information sharing, it writes smart contracts for the warehousing and shipping process. It utilizes the implementation functions of the Ethereum operating system and antimonopoly blockchain technology, so that not all network maintenance orders can be exchanged [10].

The main research material of the article is its application in project management. The relationship is shown in Figure1[11,12].Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointExperimental research roadmap.Shared information, same as cooperative consumption, expands infrastructure through full-capacity integration of products and services. Among them, the Oxford English Dictionary defines the economic sector as economically, the goods or services that people share through free or paid means [13]. Currently, as the Chinese economy changes and expands, economic participation has become a new model for future economic growth. According to the 2016 \"China Sharing Economy Development Report,\" China's economic growth in 2015 exceeded 195 million US dollars, accounting for 1.59% of GDP. Information is also spread out to meet different needs. In today's new economic environment, the sharing economy needs to use the integration of resources such as capital and information technology as a means, with the goal of improving resource utilization, and to realize the temporary transfer of resources [14]. It uses nonessential elements as the basis for the ability to establish the mutual aid relationship between supply and demand, rebuild the connection between the two, and understand the changes in the"
"to realize the temporary transfer of resources [14]. It uses nonessential elements as the basis for the ability to establish the mutual aid relationship between supply and demand, rebuild the connection between the two, and understand the changes in the \"supply side\" and \"demand side.\" It effectively reduces the problem of information asymmetry between supply and demand and forms the exchange and sharing of the industrial ecological environment. Compared with the traditional economy, the top priority is the sharing platform and the other four elements that constitute the sharing economy. Suppliers are nonessential suppliers, and the rest needs to be distributed by both parties. A shared platform is a place to understand the role of sharing and build bridges of communication. Within the framework of understanding the sharing economy, sharing platforms seamlessly integrate infrastructure with network support. It establishes balance and listening between supply chain needs and demands, while building business trust through e-mail technical support that provides security features for the implementation of human resource development programs. The components of the shared platform are shown in Figure2[15,16].Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointShared information elements diagram.Information sharing has created a logistics model under the sharing economy.

"viewerPowerPointShared information elements diagram.Information sharing has created a logistics model under the sharing economy. Due to the volatility of logistics itself, in order to ensure sufficient logistics resources to maintain normal operations, enterprises need to take effective measures to reduce logistics compliance [17,18]. The emergence of shared information is to resolve differences caused by factors such as seasons, holidays, and environments, improve connectivity between systems, and avoid wasting resources. Shared logistics can be defined as the purpose of sharing information is to use Internet information technology to integrate and temporarily integrate the excessively dispersed logistics resources in society to achieve diversification (shown in Figure3) [19]. In other words, sharing information means that the logistics resource owners of the information system use the Internet to obtain temporarily remaining information resources or services in a paid manner. It is a logistics method that shares the right to use other people's information, provides information resource operation and resource deployment rate, and reduces logistics costs [20].Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointIntegration diagram of shared information resources.Project management is based on the management department.

"shared information resources.Project management is based on the management department. It is completed by a \"virtual organization\" composed of scientific research units, scientific researchers, and field experts. In this virtual organization, organization members seek and utilize the knowledge resources in the organization in order to meet their own knowledge needs (improve scientific research level, increase knowledge stock, complete management work, etc.). At the same time, they provide their own expertise, results, and experience to meet the knowledge needs of other members of the organization. This is the fundamental motivation and reason for knowledge sharing in project management to occur. For the management department, the purpose of its work is to do a good job in project management. In project management, the completion of tasks at each stage requires a specific set of knowledge combinations. For managers, they not only need to have management knowledge but also need to have certain domain knowledge, in order to be able to better complete the project management work [21,22]. At the same time, they provide other organizations with their knowledge, skills, and experience to help other organization members solve various problems encountered in the process of completing their tasks.

"problems encountered in the process of completing their tasks. Therefore, the need for knowledge sharing in project management stems from the fact that every member of the organization will encounter knowledge gaps more or less when completing their own tasks. This knowledge gap is related to the amount of knowledge and practical experience of the members themselves, as well as the degree of correlation between tasks. In order to complete the task, each member must fill the knowledge gap encountered in the process of completing the task and must seek the assistance of knowledge, skills, and experience from other members of the organization as shown in Figure4[23].Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of information sharing motivation in project management.The model uses the PeerSim simulation environment for simulation experiments. PeerSim is an extensible, dynamic P2P protocol simulation environment. It offers two different types of simulation, period-based and event-based. The simulation environment can also be customized by loading different extension components [24].

"License. The model adopts the BitTorrent protocol as the test environment of the P2P file sharing system. The simulation of the BitTorrent protocol is realized in an event-driven way in PeerSim. The messages in the real protocol are defined as events in this simulation environment, and in addition, it also includes some timeout events. When implementing a simulation, each event is an instance of the SimpleEvent class and contains different integer values to mark the different events. Each message is an instance of the SimpleMsg class that inherits from the SimpleEvent class. The types of messages that appear in the simulation environment are shown in Table1.Table  1.Simulation environment parameter settings.ParameterDefaultsDescribeSimulation.endtime7200000Simulate 2 hours download timeNetwork.size500The number of initial nodes in the networkFile_size500Share file sizeMax_swarm_size50Number of nodes in each networkMax_growth20Number of nodes that can be increased in each networkNewer_distr80Nodes without any resources in the new node proportionDynamics.minsize10Minimum number of nodes in the networkDynamics.add5Dynamically increase the number of new nodes every cycleDynamics.remove1Number of new nodes to dynamically leave each cycleFree_rider_distr20The proportion of free-riding nodes in the networkIn the absence of any free-rider nodes and any other attacking nodes, the comparison between the proposed model and the original BitTorrent protocol is shown in Figure5.

The number of Seeder nodes keeps rising over time. The resource sharing of nodes in the system can be obtained through the change in the number of Seeder nodes. The model proposed in this chapter is identical to the original BitTorrent protocol, except that the trust management model in the middle and late stages of the simulation is slightly faster than the original protocol. This is because, after accumulating enough recommended trust values, when facing unfamiliar nodes, nodes no longer blindly attempt to unblock but select nodes with higher upload rates to share resources according to the recommended trust values. But because there are no free-rider nodes and any other attack nodes at this time, each node does its best to download and share resources. This makes the sharing speed of the nodes in the system not obvious compared with the original protocol.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of the proposed model with the original BitTorrent protocol.This shows that in the proposed model, the free-rider node mainly obtains resources in the later stage of resource sharing.

"in the proposed model, the free-rider node mainly obtains resources in the later stage of resource sharing. From the analysis of the model design, the number of newly added nodes decreases due to the later stage of resource sharing. Therefore, when a node performs a contact blocking operation, there are not enough normal nodes to give resources. It can only contact blocking and sending data to free-rider nodes with low trust values. The reason for this phenomenon is that the trust value in the model is relative, not absolute. It cannot set nodes lower than a certain service trust value or recommended trust value as free-rider nodes but can only sort nodes so that nodes with higher trust values can obtain resources first. As shown in Figure6, when the free-rider nodes in the file sharing system account for 40% of the total number of nodes, using the proposed model can achieve a better shielding effect on the free-rider nodes. At 5000 seconds, using this model already shows a clear advantage over the original protocol. By comparing with Figure5, there are half of the normal nodes in Figure5at this time. In the period from 2000 seconds to 6000 seconds, the number of nodes that complete the resource download in Figure6can almost reach half of the number of nodes that complete the resource download in Figure5; that is, the download completion degree of the normal node is hardly affected by the free-rider node.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointCollusion attack.3.1.

Database DesignThe data reading of the shared logistics information platform includes reading from two persistent storages, the database and the blockchain.

"sharing needs are proactively proposed by the information sharing subject, so the content of the information required is clear. According to the information set representation of the information, it is not difficult to extract some main features of the demand information. According to the specific description of these characteristics to carry out the similarity analysis between the content of the demand information and the content to be checked, the information related to the content of the demand information can be retrieved. Assuming that the required knowledge content is a setQ= {q1,q2, ...,qm} composed of thousands of phrases, according to the definition of the information set,Qcan be regarded as a formal carrier, which is called the information setQ. It is expressed as follows:(1)It performs related operations on the demand information set and the information set to be checked.(2)It determines the information set degree of the required information set and the subset of information to be checked.(3)At this time, the data set degree between the demand data setQand itemAis smaller than that with itemB. This means that itemBis closer to the retrieval content, so itemBshould be ranked in front of itemAin the retrieval result.(4)In the formula,N0 is the data to be evaluated;Cis all the features corresponding to the comprehensive indexbk(k= 1,2, ...,m), that is, all the individual indicatorsccorresponding to the comprehensive indexbk(i= 1,2, ...,n).Viis the value thatNtakes"

According to the previous formula, the correlation function of each single index of the matter element to be evaluated can be calculated.(5)According to the knowledge evaluation method of the article, the matter-element model of the antievaluation index system is established as follows:(6)4. Information Resource Sharing Mode Based on BlockchainThe reason why the road enterprise transportation information sharing system project adopts the analytic hierarchy process for project risk assessment and analysis is also because of the certain characteristics of AHP in solving complex decision-making problems. First of all, the biggest advantage of AHP is that it can deal with a combination of qualitative and quantitative problems. This project is a typical information system implementation project with many sources of risk. In the process of project development and application, based on multidimensional risk identification, multitarget and multiangle risk factors will be generated and integrated on this basis. Finally, using the theoretical processing of linear algebra for the matrix set obtained from all the comparison information, the deeper comprehensive information is excavated as decision support. By"

Finally, using the theoretical processing of linear algebra for the matrix set obtained from all the comparison information, the deeper comprehensive information is excavated as decision support. By inquiring on the government service platform of the Ministry of Transport, we integrated the data again on the basis of building a road-enterprise transportation information sharing system, as shown in Table4. Among them, the internal risks in the implementation of the road enterprise information sharing system project include technology and manufacturer risk sources. External risks include two major sources of risk: customers and the environment.

A blockchain-based communication system is a distributed way of sharing information resources. The basis for exchanging information sources is the collection of information, that is, the storage and organization of information. The blockchain manages the information and block structure of the linked list chain, so the key to realizing blockchain data collection is to solve the data storage problem. There are two ways to collect information, depending on whether the source of the information is stored directly in the module. (1) The information is directly stored in the module, and the information source is integrated into the module chain, that is, the information source path in the chain. In addition to this, blockchain can not only locate or retrieve information resources in peer-to-peer networks but also store information resources. This approach features a"
"into the module chain, that is, the information source path in the chain. In addition to this, blockchain can not only locate or retrieve information resources in peer-to-peer networks but also store information resources. This approach features a decentralized database that stores a full copy at every point. And in a blockchain like the Bitcoin blockchain, multiple areas are used to store information, including the output of the coinbase field, the scriptPubKey field that publishes the transaction, and the shared transaction address. They are both smaller and denser, which increases the packet size of unused transactional memory. In practical applications, messages are stored in a blockchain consisting of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original share in Bitcoin is stored in the Bitcoin 230009 blockchain module for multiple transactions. (2) It only collects block code information, local information sources, servers, cloud storage, etc. Among them, the blockchain is used to query or search for information resources in the peer-to-peer network. The exchange of information resources is actually completed in the underlying network, and the reliability of information exchange can be achieved through contracts. Part of this approach is that information is centralized in a mess, and information resources are scattered outside the blockchain.

"approach is that information is centralized in a mess, and information resources are scattered outside the blockchain. But with OP_RETURN metadata, it is possible to include the OP_RETURN output in a normal transaction and store up to 83 bytes of index information. Even though these data are stored in blocks, it does not increase the number of unused transaction output sets in memory.

"users. This research is mainly about blockchain writing about data storage and traffic management, and designing storage for smart contracts in Solidity language. Vendors and suppliers collaborate to develop meaningful contracts (as shown in Figure9) to enable a decentralized information-sharing system. The research designs the smart contract from two aspects. On the one hand, it is designed according to the state of the participating objects in the logistics link of the shared logistics information platform. On the other hand, it is to design the methods provided in the function, mainly including storage contracts and transportation contracts. The contract implements order operations in the process of warehousing and transportation, including creating orders, obtaining order information, order modification, and deletion, decentralized payment after the order is completed, and mutual evaluation among participating users. The interaction between the shared logistics information platform and the smart contract is realized through the Web3.js interface.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointInteraction diagram between platform users and smart contracts.Peer-to-peer blockchain networks identify collections of data in the form of blockchain descriptions and select resource information exchanges in the blockchain model.

"of blockchain descriptions and select resource information exchanges in the blockchain model. The blockchain itself has two messaging services: collection and distribution. Therefore, the blockchain source information distribution is suitable for writing and measuring blockchain networks. Increasing the scale of the blockchain network can realize the sharing of information server resources, that is, connecting the blockchain network to multiple devices and individuals of customers and participants, and ensuring that the blockchain information community is legally protected. Everyone uses this method to share information, but it makes sense to share it with someone. In practice, as long as this model exists, the scope of blockchain sharing can be expanded. It is also possible to bundle the private chain and the alliance chain to gradually form a core layer with all the functions of the inner layer. Its working efficiency is shown in Figure10.It can be seen from the figure that the work efficiency based on the blockchain algorithm is similar to that of the core layer, indicating that the blockchain technology can effectively expand the scope of blockchain sharing and improve work efficiency.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointComparison of the efficiency of each project.5.

"of the efficiency of each project.5. DiscussionRegarding the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain information sharing system, this system is mainly based on the resource sharing system and the data sharing system based on the blockchain. Blockchain-based information sharing systems have distinct advantages and disadvantages.In terms of method, blockchain-based data sharing has the following advantages over network data sharing: In a distributed system, there is no standard service center, and all participants share information, collect information, and experience information sharing-based methods. Second, based on the scalability and integration of blockchain information sharing systems, information sharing and knowledge gathering are transactions in the same way and fully recorded. And blockchain transactions are open, transparent, reliable, and trustworthy. It can utilize blockchain privacy monitoring without revealing the personal information of the participants. In contrast, in a network-based data sharing system, the interaction information is stored on the server. The information is not the same between the user and the server. This presents significant challenges for data management, statistics, and data sharing. Third, based on the blockchain information sharing system, scale system, and integration system, there is no need for intermediaries, and there is no need for intermediaries to participate in data sharing. This completes the direct transfer of"
"sharing. Third, based on the blockchain information sharing system, scale system, and integration system, there is no need for intermediaries, and there is no need for intermediaries to participate in data sharing. This completes the direct transfer of information sharing and shared system value. This is especially important for integrating data source systems. As long as there is a complete system, all computer information can be accessed, making the whole system safe and reliable, and ensuring the continuous and improvement of shared information is more efficient.From a model perspective, blockchain-based data sharing also has the following rewards compared to web-based data sharing. First, for blockchain data sharing systems, limited availability and limited transaction size limit availability. Big data storage requirements are difficult to meet, fast storage space directly affects the efficiency of data sharing applications, and the number of transactions that can be processed in one-stop is limited. If the block capacity is too large, it will affect the performance of the blockchain system. Second, blockchain-based data sharing systems need to keep online sources of information secure and reliable and continually ensure that relevant sources are always accessible. Applications such as cloud storage and servers lead to reliance on cloud storage. This weakens the actual impact of the entire blockchain system. Third, due to the limitations of the operation of the"
"ensure that relevant sources are always accessible. Applications such as cloud storage and servers lead to reliance on cloud storage. This weakens the actual impact of the entire blockchain system. Third, due to the limitations of the operation of the blockchain network, the source of distribution is slow, especially if the transaction speed supported by the blockchain information is slower than the current key information distribution system. The actual transaction speed is even slower than the contract compared to the midpoint, and the transaction chain speed is private and only suitable for the opportunity of frequent transactions. It is easy to create barriers in areas where big data sources are shared. Fourth, because the blockchain does not change, data and information entering the blockchain can be viewed. But the information does not change and is deleted or hidden even if it proves to be false or illegal. This creates problems when managing data in a blockchain-based distribution system. Therefore, using the Coinbase site in the database block also limits the total number of items that can be stored and is not suitable for large data sharing systems. To correct the above errors, significant improvements to the blockchain, existing blockchains, and their consensus and implementation policies are required.6.

"existing blockchains, and their consensus and implementation policies are required.6. ConclusionCurrently, blockchain applications are very common in the financial field. Industries are rapidly increasing their budgets for it and shifting to other areas such as supply chain, capacity, education, and intellectual property protection. But it is still in its infancy. If it uses blockchain, a blockchain network for data source services, there will be many immediate benefits. It uses blockchain to share data sources and complete data collection and sharing requirements. However, the methods and capabilities used by block technology need to be improved. There are still important problems to be solved in the process of blockchain collaboration and implementation and even the development of the blockchain network, such as the uncertainty of the future development of the blockchain and the legal impact of smart contracts. Large-scale blockchain applications in the data services space will take a long time. It will compete with network-based data sharing and internal distribution system based on access shares. A blockchain-based information system is an independent system. It creates a comprehensive and reliable worldwide record of the distribution of problem behaviors. This is especially true for digital libraries and commercial data collectors who frequently use B2B and B2G e-commerce business models when allocating internal resources.

"distribution of problem behaviors. This is especially true for digital libraries and commercial data collectors who frequently use B2B and B2G e-commerce business models when allocating internal resources. The blockchain-based data sharing system should adopt storage systems and functions such as cloud storage, so that the purpose of updating can be fully achieved. Basically, a service system that uses blockchain as a storage tool for notary services presents a challenge to the storage service itself. In conclusion, there are still some problems with blockchain and its technology. There are still many problems in implementing different information resource sharing methods in blockchain-based systems. Relevant information service agencies should pay close attention to the development and growth of blockchain, pay attention to blockchain development and technology, industries, and applications, actively use blockchain to create their own innovative development, and prepare for future changes.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.References1Ølnes S.,Ubacht J., andJanssen M.,Blockchain in government: benefits and implications of distributed ledger technology for information sharing,Government Information Quarterly.

"AbstractHuman resources are the cornerstone of operational operation. Good management of human resource information can enable businesses to operate effectively. However, for the time being, most enterprises still use traditional methods of allocating human resources, which are difficult to meet the development needs of enterprises. In order to find the optimal allocation of human resources in an enterprise, this article is based on \"Internet + artificial intelligence,\" using methods such as case analysis and literature analysis to collect data from databases such as CNKI, Wanfang Database, and SSCI, and uses fog computing to build a model for the optimal allocation of human resources which is proposed, and a large number of relevant literature studies are read and analyzed through the literature survey method. According to the research needs, through the research and summary of the content of the literature, the research structure found that there are many problems in the current human resource information management system. After the optimization of models and algorithms, the allocation of human resources has been greatly improved. The matching rate of personnel and job positions has increased by more than 50%. The operation efficiency index of the enterprise is above 0.8, an increase of about 30%.

"efficiency index of the enterprise is above 0.8, an increase of about 30%. This shows that \"Internet + artificial intelligence\" can effectively optimize the enterprise human resource information management system, promote the greater use of its human resource value, bring higher economic returns to the enterprise, and provide assistance for the long-term stable and healthy development of the enterprise.1. IntroductionIn today's society, human resources, as science, play a vital role in socioeconomic development and scientific and technological progress. They are a very important social resource and can promote the development of other resources at the same time. The allocation of human resources is used as a link between people and material data. The organic chain together is a key link to whether human resources can play their full role [1]. At present, many jobs still retain the traditional human resource organization, facing a series of human resource problems such as the aging of the personnel structure and the relative lack of professional talents. With the development of time, this new management method will gradually be eliminated. Fog computing provides services to users locally. On the one hand, it can reduce business processing delays and improve work efficiency. On the other hand, it can reduce network and bandwidth requirements and save the system in general. Therefore, we have innovated and optimized the design of the human resources information management"
"business processing delays and improve work efficiency. On the other hand, it can reduce network and bandwidth requirements and save the system in general. Therefore, we have innovated and optimized the design of the human resources information management system based on the Internet + artificial intelligence, reasonably allocates human resources, quickly activates existing human resources, optimizes the actual allocation of human resources to maximize human resources, and strengthens the management of human resources information in order to better adapt to future market demands [2].In the modern enterprise management system, human capital pays more attention to the requirements of the enterprise management system, further formulates clear regulations, and refines the responsibilities of enterprise managers [3]. The optimized configuration of human resources based on the Internet + artificial intelligence can effectively revitalize human resources, and employees' sense of responsibility and work initiative are significantly improved. The management level is reduced, and the enterprise entity is realized. The specific work is sinking. The matters that need to be reported at different levels are directly handled by each business department. Each business department directly participates in business management activities. The collaboration between departments is closer. The interaction is more efficient [4].Belizon et al. studied the differences in the use of international"
"department. Each business department directly participates in business management activities. The collaboration between departments is closer. The interaction is more efficient [4].Belizon et al. studied the differences in the use of international integration mechanisms in various human resource management (HRM) practices by multinational companies. Their findings indicate that personnel, information, and formal-based mechanisms are positively related to the use of centralized-based integration processes [5]. Liu and Yue use fog computing to create models and allocate resources. In his research, they found that fog computing is stable and meets the demand [6]. Leijun points out that, in today′s rapid economic development, the traditional human resource allocation model is inconsistent with the current development trend, which makes it difficult for many enterprises that are still using traditional human resource allocation methods [7].Wang Wenxin believes that, in today's rapid development of information, knowledge is the first contribution to the promotion of human society. How to arrange people with different roles in suitable positions, mobilize their enthusiasm for work, and develop their potential is the optimization of human resource management. The most important issue is the use of human resource-related theories, introducing the meaning of human resource allocation and the method of optimizing human resources and discussing the important role of human resource"
"of human resource management. The most important issue is the use of human resource-related theories, introducing the meaning of human resource allocation and the method of optimizing human resources and discussing the important role of human resource optimal allocation for social development [5]; Tang Linyu believes that fog computing can provide people with more services. Starting from the allocation of computing resources, they use fog computing to make models and allocate resources. In the research, it is found that fog computing is stable and demand matching. The results prove that the use of fog computing can make the allocation time relatively stable. The delay and accuracy of the calculation in the fog are better than the original calculation method [6]. Zhang Bo believes that the development and growth of enterprises cannot be separated from the optimal allocation of human resources. However, in today's rapid economic development, the traditional human resource allocation model does not match the current development, which makes it difficult for many enterprises that still use traditional human resource allocation. In this regard, he emphatically introduced the methods of optimizing the allocation of human resources in the enterprise and cited relevant examples [7]. These studies have certain reference values for this article, but due to the narrow data cited in the research, the data industry is basically limited to individual industries and has no universal"
"in the enterprise and cited relevant examples [7]. These studies have certain reference values for this article, but due to the narrow data cited in the research, the data industry is basically limited to individual industries and has no universal effect.This article applies the latest human resource allocation theory to fully mention the status quo of the human resource allocation of the enterprise, to seek to explore a specific plan for the establishment of a human resource information management system, and to provide a reference for relevant undertakings. Create an ecosystem structure model based on the \"Internet + Artificial Intelligence\" to carry out a thorough analysis of the current status of the new system management of human resources and make relevant countermeasures and proposals on the basis of the analytical conclusions to help similar companies build more competitive new human resource management system to better help the company to develop and develop.2. Innovative Methods for the Construction of Human Resource Information Management System2.1. Fog CalculationFog computing is a system-level architecture that provides computing, storage, control, and networking functions near the data generation source along the cloud to the continuum of things. The fog computing architecture is mainly divided into three layers: cloud computing layer, fog computing layer, and mobile terminal layer. The fog computing architecture brings the service closer to the end user,"
"the cloud to the continuum of things. The fog computing architecture is mainly divided into three layers: cloud computing layer, fog computing layer, and mobile terminal layer. The fog computing architecture brings the service closer to the end user, reduces latency, saves energy consumption, and enhances the user experience [8].The bottom layer of the architecture is the mobile terminal layer, which contains a large number of smart devices and sensors. Data collection, service requests, and so on all come from the bottom-end terminal equipment. Smart terminal equipment can preprocess and compress data to filter out some useless data [9]. At the same time, terminal equipment can also communicate through equipment such as base stations or routers to realize data sharing. The fog computing layer is located between the cloud computing layer and mobile terminal devices and is a bridge connecting cloud servers and terminal devices. Simple events and emergencies are detected at this layer, so that users can respond quickly.The delay of the fog computing layer includes the communication delay between fog devices and the calculation delay of fog devices. For communication delay, in the undirected graph composed of fog devices, the communication delay between fog nodes is used as the weight. As the amount of calculation increases, the calculation delay of the fog device increases accordingly; the more calculations increase and the more fog devices, the more calculation delay time"
"communication delay between fog nodes is used as the weight. As the amount of calculation increases, the calculation delay of the fog device increases accordingly; the more calculations increase and the more fog devices, the more calculation delay time [10]. Therefore, use the following function to describe the calculation delay of the fog device.(1)Among them,wxis the computing power of the fog devicex,biis the amount of tasks processed by the fog device, andaiis a preset real number. Therefore, the delay of the fog computing node is expressed as follows:(2)The fog computing layer is composed of fog nodes deployed around IoT devices. The fog nodes are connected to devices such as base stations or routers, thereby reducing the transmission delay from device to device. In addition, a large number of fog nodes are deployed at the edge of the network, and even the same service is deployed on multiple fog nodes. This not only reduces the risk of service interruption caused by a failure of one fog node but also makes one fog node more than one. Equipment includes base stations or routers process data [11]. The fog node in the network can also be connected to the cloud data center. When the IoT device generates massive data that needs to be processed and the computing power of a single fog node cannot meet its needs, the fog node will forward the data to the cloud for processing. There will undoubtedly be a greater communication delay and reduce the efficiency of the service. In"
"needs to be processed and the computing power of a single fog node cannot meet its needs, the fog node will forward the data to the cloud for processing. There will undoubtedly be a greater communication delay and reduce the efficiency of the service. In the calculation, because the self-correction function is added in each step of the calculation process, the maximum change of pressure and saturation allowed by each grid node in the two adjacent steps is limited [12]. Therefore, in the process of calculating the node penetration rate at time (n+ 1), the following basic formula is used:(3)Here, we assume that the initial pressure of the reservoir is PP, the pressure value at timenispn, and the pressure value at timen+ 1 ispn+ 1; then whenpn+ 1 < PP and PP =pn+ 1,(4)Whenpn+ 1 ≥ PP,(5)This paper uses immune optimization algorithm to study the energy consumption of data processing in fog computing. In the traditional three-layer network architecture, considering the long distance and high energy consumption when the cloud server caches data resources to the fog node, a four-layer network architecture model is proposed, that is, between the cloud computing layer and the fog computing layer. Add a layer of proxy fog server to make the cloud server cache data resources in advance and provide local services [13]. The specific process of addressing the proxy fog server through the optimal immune algorithm is described in detail, thereby reducing the energy consumption of the fog"
"make the cloud server cache data resources in advance and provide local services [13]. The specific process of addressing the proxy fog server through the optimal immune algorithm is described in detail, thereby reducing the energy consumption of the fog node to obtain data resources from the proxy fog server and also reducing the amount of precached resources by the cloud server to the fog node. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the four-layer network architecture model in data processing energy consumption is proved.2.2. New Human Resource Management SystemHuman resource management refers to a series of management activities based on the organization and mobilization of corporate human resources to promote the attraction of outstanding talents, enhance the enthusiasm of corporate talents, and promote the realization of corporate organizational goals [14]. Whether it is a matter of talent selection, employee incentives, or human resource management planning, training, performance, salary management, and so on, all activities' management shall be implemented to achieve the organizational objectives of the undertaking. The sole purpose is to promote the implementation of the organizational objectives of the undertaking for the improvement of the undertaking. The enthusiasm of talent and the attraction of exceptional talent can be effective human resource management.The theory of human resource planning mainly includes two aspects."
"objectives of the undertaking for the improvement of the undertaking. The enthusiasm of talent and the attraction of exceptional talent can be effective human resource management.The theory of human resource planning mainly includes two aspects. On the one hand, the theory believes that the viability of an enterprise comes from the structure and quantity of human resource management. On the other hand, the theory believes that the implementation of human resource planning by an enterprise can satisfy the development of the enterprise itself. To meet the development and interests of employees [15], human resource planning is a very important content in the human resource management system of an enterprise. As a key management activity, human resource planning is related to the rational, scientific, and comprehensive human resource management. Supported by human resource planning theory, the enterprise implementation that is reasonable human resource management strategy can not only improve the production and operation management level of the enterprise but also meet the strategic development needs of the enterprise [16].Management theory believes that, according to the close relationship between the scope of management and the level of management, there will be two forms of organizational structure: flat structure and straight structure. The so-called flat structure is a structure with few management levels and large management width. The case of the formula structure is the"
"level of management, there will be two forms of organizational structure: flat structure and straight structure. The so-called flat structure is a structure with few management levels and large management width. The case of the formula structure is the opposite [17]. Its structure is derived from the nonlinear partial differential equation of Taylor series expansion motion:(6)whereRis the displacement relative to timetanddis the distance of propagation; in this study,dis the length of the sample, the second- and third-order elastic constants andis the velocity. Equations related to elastic constants of nonlinear parameters are as follows:(7)Variants of nonlinear motion equations are as follows:(8)The solution of the equation is as follows:(9)The relationship betweenR2andR3can be obtained:(10)(11)When encountering obstacles,A1,A2, andA3, respectively, indicate operating efficiency(12)(13)According to the specific situation of the unit, to determine their ideal management width, the endogenous driving force of the flat management model of the enterprise lies in the continuous improvement of the manager's personal ability [18]. Through flat design, scientific job distribution, and flat management of corporate managers to enrich front-line staff, revitalize existing human resources, solve the contradiction between redundancy and shortage, improve corporate executives' sense of responsibility and work initiative, reduce risks, and improve the quality and efficiency of corporate"
"front-line staff, revitalize existing human resources, solve the contradiction between redundancy and shortage, improve corporate executives' sense of responsibility and work initiative, reduce risks, and improve the quality and efficiency of corporate collection and management, the promotion of modernization of corporate management systems is inevitable trends in corporate development [19].2.3. Optimization and Innovation of the Human Resource System under Internet + Artificial IntelligenceIn the Internet economic environment, the transformation of corporate business models has caused companies to face a new competitive situation. The traditional capital competition is constantly developing in the direction of intellectual resource competition. In this process, the importance of human resources will inevitably become more prominent. The decision-making choices of enterprise human resource management must also be changed [20]. In the context of the Internet economy, companies can only obtain strong development forces if they obtain strong human capital power. At the same time, they should effectively stimulate the capabilities and value of human resources through effective management and maximize their functions to meet the development needs of the company. This requires companies to pay attention to the transformation of the Internet model of human resource management [21]. Managers at all levels are in charge of affairs closely related to the various production, operation,"
"development needs of the company. This requires companies to pay attention to the transformation of the Internet model of human resource management [21]. Managers at all levels are in charge of affairs closely related to the various production, operation, and management activities of the enterprise. The development of the enterprise depends on the efficient completion of these basic tasks. Under the Internet thinking, due to the change of the status of human resources in enterprise management, as a result, the implementation methods of management functions at all levels have changed. The system management under the traditional model has not been able to adapt to the Internet thinking. Therefore, the functions of the managers at all levels will also undergo corresponding changes. Human resource management requires adaptation [22]. Calculate the similarity between the resources in the resource collection and the resources requested by the user:(14)wherearepresents the weight and the range is between [0, 1]. The simulation parameters are calculated as follows:(15)According to the humanistic characteristics of human resource management, it is very important to establish a unique cultural management model in the implementation of human resource management in an enterprise. Culture-led enterprises have more team cohesion and market competitiveness and can be more efficient in order to achieve the strategic development goals of the company; the current theoretical research on"
"of human resource management in an enterprise. Culture-led enterprises have more team cohesion and market competitiveness and can be more efficient in order to achieve the strategic development goals of the company; the current theoretical research on corporate management proposes a corporate culture management model. This is the most promising corporate management theory so far and the most practical value corporate management model [23].With the development of the Internet economy, the development of enterprises has become more dependent on talents, and Internet thinking is to study employees and enterprises as a whole. As the basic components of enterprises, employees must play a more important role in the Internet economy effect. Under the Internet thinking, the construction of human resource management mode in enterprises must fully consider the principle of people centeredness. Whether it is in the relationship between all members of the enterprise or the relationship between the enterprise and employees, the management, coordination, and combination of enterprise development can achieve significant results. This is one of the basic principles of the construction of a human-oriented Internet-thinking human resource management model [24].Incentive theory is the content of enterprise human management theory. In order to effectively stimulate employees' working ability and enthusiasm, good results can be obtained through certain incentives. Incentive theory believes that"
"model [24].Incentive theory is the content of enterprise human management theory. In order to effectively stimulate employees' working ability and enthusiasm, good results can be obtained through certain incentives. Incentive theory believes that the implementation of more powerful incentives for employees can promote the efficient realization of corporate goals. However, if the company's incentive level is insufficient, employees' enthusiasm for work cannot be exerted and the efficiency of achieving corporate goals will be low.Based on the relevant research on corporate human resource management under the domestic background, it can be seen that human resource management, as the core competitiveness of an enterprise, is related to the long-term strategic development of the enterprise under the background of the market economy. In order to enable enterprises to effectively use various resources in the context of the Internet and play an important role in human resource management, enterprises must innovate in human resource management from two aspects of technology and management, so that they can better conform to the development trend of the times, make enterprise management truly organically integrate with the Internet background, and meet the various needs of enterprise development in the new era [25].According to the viewpoint of the resource school, if the Internet is only used as technology and cannot spontaneously produce an effect, it must be transformed into a"
"background, and meet the various needs of enterprise development in the new era [25].According to the viewpoint of the resource school, if the Internet is only used as technology and cannot spontaneously produce an effect, it must be transformed into a competitive advantage through a series of organizational management methods combined with changes in thinking. On the organizational level, the implementation of electronic human resource management as a process of management innovation may conflict with existing stakeholders. Since the human resource department is the main promoter of electronic human resource management innovation, its influence on the organization is crucial, that is, whether it can obtain the support of executives and parallel departments through its own influence.3. Innovative Experiment of Human Resource Information Management System Construction3.1. Experimental PurposeThis article makes full use of the research results in the field of human resource allocation under the Internet + still intelligence and takes the realization of the company's sustainable development as the starting point. Through in-depth research on the company's human resource allocation status and existing problems, it builds a system for the optimization of the company's human resource allocation, and it puts forward feasibility and scientific opinions on advancing the optimization of human resource allocation, so as to help enterprises build a more competitive human resource system"
"for the optimization of the company's human resource allocation, and it puts forward feasibility and scientific opinions on advancing the optimization of human resource allocation, so as to help enterprises build a more competitive human resource system and promote the improvement of their market competitive position.3.2. Establish a Model Evaluation Index SystemSome conclusions can be drawn from the actual observation of the objects. Generally speaking, the system of an evaluation index includes three levels of evaluation indicators: it is the relationship between gradual decomposition and improvement. Among them, the first-level evaluation indicators and the second-level evaluation indicators are relatively abstract and cannot be used as a direct basis for the evaluation. The third-level evaluation indicators must be specific, measurable, and behavioral and can be used as a direct basis for assessing the teaching.Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis methods: quantitative analysis is to analyze the data of the problem, using the intuition and clear essence of mathematics to reflect the existence of the problem; qualitative analysis is to collect, read, and organize relevant domestic and foreign research literature and systematically summarize the related theoretical results.

"and systematically summarize the related theoretical results. The evaluation criteria of green supply chain performance are complex and diverse, including not only financial standards but also other nonfinancial standards. Some standards cannot be directly analyzed by quantitative methods but can only be evaluated by qualitative analysis methods. The green supply system performance evaluation standard system of the company is constructed using a model that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis methods. At the same time, it provides formulas for standard calculations and evaluation standards.3.3. Determine the Reevaluation WeightThe index weight is a numerical index indicating the importance and function of the index. In the indicator system of the evaluation plan, the weight of each indicator is different. Even if the indicator level is the same, the weight is different. Index weight is also called weight and is usually represented bya. It is a number greater than zero but less than 1, and the sum of the weights of all the first-level indicators must be equal to 1; that is, satisfy conditions 0 <a< 1 and ∑a− 1.3.4. StatisticsAll data analysis in this paper uses SPSS19.0, statistical test uses double-sided test, the significance is defined as 0.05, andp< 0.05 is considered significant.

"significance is defined as 0.05, andp< 0.05 is considered significant. The statistical results are displayed as mean ± standard deviation (x± SD). When the test data complies with the normal distribution, the doubleT-test is used for comparison within the group, and the independent sampleT-test is used for comparison between the groups. If the regular distribution is insufficient, two independent samples and two related samples will be used for inspection.4. Innovative Experiment Analysis of Human Resource Information Management System Construction4.1. Status of the CompanyWe have selected five companies to investigate the current status of their employees. We have selected the companies to be an information technology company in the city. Such companies are highly sensitive to staffing and their staffing is more reasonable. We survey employees and human resource systems and classify them by age, gender, and so on. The specific data are shown in Table1.Table  1.Distribution of employees.The first companyThe second companyThe third companyThe fourth companyThe fifth company18-28273338293129-35252736243436-48332229173149-601917131617Male7566724969Female4045384742It can be seen from Figure1that, in these five companies, the age and gender distribution of employees are not very different, and the main employees are between 18 and 35 years old.

"age and gender distribution of employees are not very different, and the main employees are between 18 and 35 years old. This is because people in this age group are generally receiving information quickly. The stage of strong learning ability is the main type of recruitment for information technology enterprises. The company's male-female ratio is generally around 6.5 : 3.5, and the fourth company's male-female ratio is 5 : 5. At the management level, the gap between age and gender is larger than that between employees. The specific data are shown in Table2.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of employees in different companies.Table  2.Distribution of leadership.The first companyThe second companyThe third companyThe fourth companyThe fifth company18-282246329-35311671436-485171591249-6079181911Male1227193129Female51214711From Figure2, we can see that, at the company's management level, the age is generally over 35 years, accounting for more than 60%. This is because leaders generally have more requirements, and they have high requirements for people's skills and need people to constantly accumulate. In terms of gender, the leadership of these companies is mostly men, accounting for more than 65%, and the proportion of women is smaller than that of men.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of employees in different companies.4.2.

Company EmployeesEducational background is our most intuitive manifestation of personal abilities. Before we truly recognize a person, we can only judge a person's abilities based on some external factors, such as human resources. Therefore, we have made relevant statistics on the academic qualifications of the employees and leaders of these five plus companies. The specific data are shown in Table3.Table  3.Employee education.The first companyThe second companyThe third companyThe fourth companyThe fifth companyPrimary school54276Junior high school17139412High school2419132017University3329454755Master's degree241719119Doctoral degree8615139It can be seen from Figure3that, in enterprises, the educational background of employees is uneven, and so is the ability of employees. In statistics, we can clearly see that the employees with a college degree or below account for about 30%. The college degree is about 50%, and the college degree is only less than 20%. This is because the company we selected is of an information technology type. Generally, there are academic requirements for recruitment, which also requires us to do well in the human resources of our employees.

There are basically no graduates below high school. Most of them have a college degree or above, accounting for more than 70%. The master's degree is about 20%, far higher than the average employee.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of employees' academic qualifications.4.3. Operational Efficiency of the EnterpriseThe purpose of optimizing the allocation of human resources is to improve the operating efficiency of the enterprise, so that employees can reach a reasonable state in the production, transportation, and profitability stages of the enterprise, so that the enterprise can be profitable and promote the development and growth of the enterprise.

"employees can reach a reasonable state in the production, transportation, and profitability stages of the enterprise, so that the enterprise can be profitable and promote the development and growth of the enterprise. Therefore, we digitize the parameter utilization models of these five companies in daily production and life to make it more obvious. The details are shown in Table5.Table  5.Evaluation parameters.Employee satisfactionEmployee motivationRedundant staffPerson-post matchingEmployee benefitsBusiness efficiencyThe first company0.4120.3842.30.4190.4330.412The second company0.4990.4213.70.4430.4970.424The third company0.5060.4723.80.5120.4760.533The fourth company0.5510.5913.60.510.4940.513The fifth company0.4570.4622.60.6220.6190.577It can be seen from Figure5that, during the operation of the enterprise, the employee satisfaction and employee efficiency of these companies are around the passing line, which shows that the enterprise has not made the best use of the staff in the employment of employees. Giving full play to the enthusiasm of employees does not improve the operating efficiency of the company. After the test, the average score is about 0.5, and the redundancy rate of the company is about 4%. We also made statistics on management, as shown in Figure6.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of employees' academic qualifications.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of leadership operating efficiency.We can see from Figure6that, in"
"statistics on management, as shown in Figure6.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of employees' academic qualifications.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistribution of leadership operating efficiency.We can see from Figure6that, in the leadership, satisfaction and enthusiasm have increased, with an average value of about 0.6, exceeding 0.5 of employees, and it is about to reach a good line. This is because the company's emphasis on leadership makes it more powerful than ordinary employees. But at the leadership level, the redundancy rate has also reached about 3.5%. This shows that the company's human resource allocation to the leadership still needs to be strengthened.4.4. Comparison after the Introduction of Internet + Artificial IntelligenceThrough the model we made, we input the enterprise's human resource configuration parameters to obtain the human resource configuration adjusted by \"Internet + artificial intelligence.\" By comparing the differences between the two, we can obtain human resources based on \"Internet + artificial intelligence\" analysis to optimize the configuration effect, as shown in Table6.Table  6.Comparison after optimized allocation of human resources.Employee satisfactionEmployee motivationRedundant staff (%)Person-post matchingEmployee benefitsBusiness efficiencyOriginal configuration0.4320.3922.70.4930.5140.521Configuration after optimization0.7230.6961.20.7840.8130.797The optimal value0.8370.8260.460.8720.8430.856From"

Both exceed 50%, and the redundancy rate of enterprises has dropped by more than 40%. This shows that the Internet + artificial intelligence plays an extremely important role in the optimization of enterprise human resource information systems.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointChanges in enterprise parameters.5. ConclusionsWith the continuous improvement of my country's information technology level, its application in human resource management has also been continuously developed. The human resource management information system can reduce the level and time of information transmission and can also free human resource personnel from trivial administrative affairs, transform into the role of management to provide decision-making support and solutions, and change the service mode of the human resources department.Internet thinking is characterized by no boundaries, organizational forms are becoming more and"
"affairs, transform into the role of management to provide decision-making support and solutions, and change the service mode of the human resources department.Internet thinking is characterized by no boundaries, organizational forms are becoming more and more virtualized, and employees' adhesion to the organization is decreasing. Flexible work and remote work have become normal work methods. Enterprises need to break the original relationship of power and responsibility and establish a new type of cooperative relationship with employees. Electronic human resource management is different from the previous human resource management model. It breaks through the limitations of one-way information communication in the past and pays more attention to the multichannel communication of information within the enterprise.In the research system of modern enterprise management mode, with the improvement of related theoretical research, after two management mode leaps, it is facing the outstanding demand of the third management mode leap. From traditional experience management to scientific management and then from scientific management to human-based management, every leap has brought about a huge change in enterprise human resource management, and the human resource management needs of enterprises under the background of the Internet have undergone tremendous changes and the trend of management model development towards cultural management has become increasingly prominent.

"AbstractUnder the background of artificial intelligence (AI), a human resource information management system was designed to facilitate hospital human resource management and improve hospital management efficiency. Based on AI, SOA was constructed and Java2 platform enterprise edition (J2EE) was combined with Java to design and research hospital human resource information management system. In addition, the function and performance required by the system were tested. The results showed that the designed system showed high safety in requirement analysis and performance. The function focused mainly on the systematic analysis of personnel management, recruitment management, organization and personnel management, and patient medical information. The constructed system could work normally and achieve the efficiency of hospital human resource management. The evaluation response time of system home page access was less than 1 second when 300 users were concurrent, and the utilization rate of service CPU was lower than 50% without abnormal memory fluctuation. The concurrent response time of all 20 managers online was less than 5 seconds, and the utilization rate of the service was lower than 70%. When the information of 100 employees in the system was queried concurrently, the average CPU utilization of the database server exceeded 90%. After performance optimization, the test result showed that the transaction response time was reduced to 0.23 seconds, which met the target"
"employees in the system was queried concurrently, the average CPU utilization of the database server exceeded 90%. After performance optimization, the test result showed that the transaction response time was reduced to 0.23 seconds, which met the target requirement. In conclusion, the proposed intelligent human resource management system could reduce hospital management cost and the high sharing of human resource information provided a reference for the decision-making system of hospital leaders.1. IntroductionA management information system (MIS) is an interpersonal system that integrates the collection, transmission, storage, maintenance, management, processing, output, and use of organization data. MIS can manage and process the organization data and design the processed data into simulation technology and management models by optimization to provide the decisions for hospital decision makers [1,2]. Human resource management is the foundation and core of hospital management. The demands for hospital resource management by various hospital organizational structures are different. The flexible utilization of human resource management system to realize the requirements of organizational structures with various patterns and to further implement the effective organization and management of data and reduce some unnecessary information sharing is an issue to be addressed currently [3,4].Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline concerned with the representation of research"
"to further implement the effective organization and management of data and reduce some unnecessary information sharing is an issue to be addressed currently [3,4].Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline concerned with the representation of research and the acquisition as well as application of knowledge [5,6]. AI and each industry involved offer the new impetus for the innovative application of enterprises and industry and the improvement of human life and provide convenience for the acquisition of information [7,8]. In terms of data analysis, AI can help human resource practitioners become more prospective [9]. Information technology is developed continuously and rapidly; translation medicine, evidence-based medicine, and pharmacoeconomics are rapidly developed; the research of clinical medicine is strongly advocated by the state; and the demand for scientific research still grows constantly [10]. Data informatization can effectively manage the information of nursing staff and plays a certain role in the analysis and decision-making of government departments [11,12]. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of designing, developing, deploying, and managing discrete models in computer environment [13-15]. The structure of SOA was simple with high flexibility, and it was widely applied [16]. However, no specialized development language provides technical support for SOA at present. Many scholars combine Java technology with SOA technology to realize information"
