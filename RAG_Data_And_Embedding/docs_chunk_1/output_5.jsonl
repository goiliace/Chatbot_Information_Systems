"be in contact with different terminal companies.The EDI system refers to a system that can automatically transmit and process business documents such as orders, invoices, and invoices among enterprises through a communication network. The communication network is the means to realize EDI. EDI involves many departments and industries, such as related companies, banks, insurance and commodity inspection, customs, and transportation. EDI first established a dedicated network among trading partners [28].In fact, there is a many-to-many relationship among the topics of container transportation information exchange as shown in Figure8.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointEDI system in multiple ports.On the whole, container transportation based on artificial intelligence multimodal transportation is not limited to only one port. Therefore, a container transportation system that can provide value-added services is established, and it is connected with the national transportation system and the international public data network.The realization of port integration requires the role of many factors, generally speaking, including port natural resources, differentiation between ports, information platforms, human resources and investment and financing, administrative mechanisms, market functions, supply chain business integration, and logistics network, etc. It is mainly for the following points:(1)The natural resource characteristics of ports lead to the division of port"
"and investment and financing, administrative mechanisms, market functions, supply chain business integration, and logistics network, etc. It is mainly for the following points:(1)The natural resource characteristics of ports lead to the division of port functions(2)The differences among ports are mainly reflected in two aspects: first, time (including inland transportation time and stay time in port) and service quality. Second, the difference in port service products is a key consideration that ports need to consider in the process of port competition(3)Building an information platform shared among regional ports is a technical guarantee for port integration. In the process of building a shared information platform, the main task is to establish an information sharing mechanism, unify information platform standards, and realize the docking of regional information platforms(4)In the process of port integration, especially the integration of cross-regional ports, the interests of various administrative regions inevitably conflict. In order to alleviate the conflicts of various administrative regions, we need a unified administrative management agency and administrative coordination agency to establish an appropriate coordination mechanism to balance the interests of all parties [29].Combining this will enable our country's container multimodal transport to be integrated and further in line with international standards as shown in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure"
"coordination mechanism to balance the interests of all parties [29].Combining this will enable our country's container multimodal transport to be integrated and further in line with international standards as shown in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointContainer system diagram.The module sharing of the information system should not only be based on the specific commercial needs of the container terminal but also be linked to the actual mailing system of the container terminal. According to the operating content and conditions of different parts of the container, the control system is divided into six parts: customer management system, electronic system, statistical data request system, transmission information system, overhead system, and payment management system. The system adopts a distributed system, and each partition can access and work independently, or call each other through a command as shown in Figure10.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem submodule.We use total transit time, total transit rate, and input indicators as active indicators to transfer data on average revenue, container loading stability rate, the annual growth rate of container transportation, and other virtual corporate organizations.

Here, we choose the total transfer rate and input indicators as the active indicators, and the use of excess investment for correlation is to analyze and solve the input and output problems of the enterprise. In the actual use process, the multimodal transportation is carried out by using the EDI system, combined with the GPS and GIS information platform Internet network technology, to ensure the accuracy of coordinated transportation. Therefore, excess investment and DEA indicators can be easily resolved. This question is shown in Figure11and Table6.Figure 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe input and output data of enterprises.Table  6.Input and output data.Line numberNet profit (USD)Goods in good conditionAnnual growth rate of trafficTotal transit timeTotal shipping costEnterprise organization cost1245611007.931150080256423012499.75.429142300290032954198.58.12616800026004. DiscussionThe current information collection technology is divided into time-based information collection technology and site-based information collection technology according to static and energy information. Generally speaking, the entire mass transportation process, that is, the multimodal transportation process, is divided into two parts: \"private area exploration\" and \"track-track discovery.\" The route station is based on the frame and mainly uses time information technology; the route tracking is mainly based on the transportation means using field-based information technology. At"
"parts: \"private area exploration\" and \"track-track discovery.\" The route station is based on the frame and mainly uses time information technology; the route tracking is mainly based on the transportation means using field-based information technology. At the same time, in order to achieve visual effects, the system mainly uses the combination of GPS and GIS information platform Internet network technology to determine the information management between the operator and the operator and the manager, and broadcast the information in real time. The response method is improved based on the actual transportation situation, including emergency information such as location, time, and speed. The information system corresponding to the multimodal transport system includes the empire information system and the back-end technology of the multimodal transport container transfer. Due to the general lack of understanding of multivehicle transportation, the control cannot cancel the previous control mode. Therefore, we can modify the previous multivehicle intermodal transportation control method, by increasing the overall planning between multiple vehicles, planning the dispatch time, and the problem of train number information, so as to solve the problem of multivehicle high-efficiency intermodal transportation in the actual transportation process. Under the previous economic system, especially under the influence of the related concepts of \"large and complete, small and complete\" in"
"to solve the problem of multivehicle high-efficiency intermodal transportation in the actual transportation process. Under the previous economic system, especially under the influence of the related concepts of \"large and complete, small and complete\" in state-owned enterprises, there are certain deficiencies in the management concepts, managers, and operators of logistics companies. And the thinking of related logistics companies does not fully understand the role of packaging and does not have a clear understanding of the operation of the multiship transportation process. Therefore, manufacturing companies do not have enough coping methods and practical solutions. The severity of the problem has led to a low degree of integration between logistics and transportation. Surprisingly, it is impossible to establish a large and professional service system. Multiple passport documents can also be used to gather information during testing at certain locations. The multivehicle license is issued by the multicarrier or its agent, certifying that the multimodal transport contracts that the goods are received and transported by the multicarrier, and the multivessel operator guarantees that the goods are delivered in accordance with the following provisions of the agreement and documents. It is the document of the property and the proof of the transfer agreement. Multiple passport documents are divided into nondistributed form and distributed form.

"following provisions of the agreement and documents. It is the document of the property and the proof of the transfer agreement. Multiple passport documents are divided into nondistributed form and distributed form. The nonbinding forms of the documents are the goods certificate and the transfer agreement certificate, but the documents are not transferable and the property right certificate. The form of transaction document refers to a combined transport document that has at least one passenger traveling by sea and can be used as the basis for the carriage of goods. The validity period of the tradable form of the multimodal passport is the same as that of the telegram. This kind of multimodal transportation is usually called a multimodal payment gateway.5. ConclusionsOur country′s container multivehicle logistics system cannot meet the requirements of the national econoour′s multivehicle logistics system, and these inconveniences are not a clean transportation problem. The growth trend of public transportation in our country is that most of the container traffic is concentrated in developed coastal areas and major ports and lack of functionality. It is a part of the macro transmission control unit, which is mainly caused by the division of components and parts in the control system. Under this management system, transportation, warehousing, real estate, and foreign trade are their own, so the logistics of the entire society cannot be a whole. Therefore, to accelerate the"
"by the division of components and parts in the control system. Under this management system, transportation, warehousing, real estate, and foreign trade are their own, so the logistics of the entire society cannot be a whole. Therefore, to accelerate the rapid development of many large container vehicles and modern logistics, an effective institutional framework is needed to promote the development of modern logistics as a macro intervention. In terminal operations, container transportation is the most important part of all work. Almost all work is done around the container. Reasonably organizing all container-related information and developing management information systems can improve the efficiency of container trade, increase the level of automation of container processes, increase the distance between each connection point, and improve the overall operation level of port management. The possibility of having an advanced container terminal control system has become an important indicator for determining whether the port is to be developed. However, in the actual use process, because there is still a lack of understanding of the relevant professionalism, the design of the system and the solutions to certain problems are still not professional enough, and a deeper understanding is needed. In the actual use process, in the future, it will definitely consider the actual problems and modify it, and it will become more and more perfect.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare"

"AbstractWith the rapid development of social economy and the change of ideology, people are increasingly enthusiastic about participating in sports events. How to make better use of the existing massive network data of sports events to solve the overload of information circulation of sports events has become a potential application problem to promote the development of sports information digitalization. Based on this problem orientation, this paper chooses to study the common characteristics of the current Internet data of sports events and the corresponding and applicable event recommendation technology and constructs feasible event recommendation model as the main direction of solution. The competition information system is the core technology system of the games and the central nervous system of the games. By summing up the previous high-level comprehensive games, the competition information system should serve the competition, command, media, and the public. The smooth construction and stable operation of the perfect design of the competition information system will reflect the organization level of the games and guarantee the success of the games.

IntroductionWith the emergence of digital media technology and the popularity of the Internet, In recent years, the sports information work adheres to strengthening top-level design, overall planning, overall benefits of guidelines; each work has made significant progress in information technology and the integration of sports business gradually strengthened, in management and service level, improving the sports industry to promote mass sports and competitive sports development, etc., playing an important supporting role [1-3].In recent years, with the improvement of China's comprehensive national strength, more and more large-scale sports events are held in China. Large-scale sports events have large scale and long preparation time [4]. It is an extremely complicated systematic project with the characteristics of complex organization and management. Taking the 11th National Games as an example, there will be 33 events, 362 events, 46 delegations, and 12,000 athletes participating in the event. Therefore, it is an inevitable choice to carry out the organization and management of large-scale sports events based on the thought of systems science and the methodology of modern systems engineering and relying on powerful modern science and technology [5].

"of systems science and the methodology of modern systems engineering and relying on powerful modern science and technology [5]. Major sports events organization and management information system is a kind of integrated use of modern information network and modern digital technology; there will be a large sports organization of internal and external management and service work by optimizing after restructuring to achieve efficient information system tools [6,7]. By using this system, we can break the restriction of time space and department and provide integrated, efficient, and high-quality information communication services for the smooth holding of large-scale sports events [8].More and more sports events have become one of the important social and cultural activities. With the increasing social attention and participation, the application of information technology in sports events has become inevitable in the environment of the rapid development of computer information technology. The games competition information system is the core technology system of the games and the central nerve of the games. It can collect, process, and release all kinds of information of the games and serve for the preparation and operation of the games efficiently [9-12].

Effective use of modern information technology means, improving the quality of the work efficiency, to ensure the smooth running of the games, has become an important part of the modern comprehensive games. With the increasing functions and organizational workload of sports events, widely with the public and the news media, information technology also needs to fit modern sporting events of the practical need of the introduction of new design and modern information technology to improve the quality of work [13,14].The research of this paper shows that the Internet data of sports events belongs to a part of sports information resources and is fragmented information data [15]. At present, some researches on the application of sports information resources and sports informatization mainly focus on sports information and sports literature, while there is little research on the application of a large number of internet-based fragmented sports event information. In this article, through analysis of the current event information in network, it has the characteristics of the recommendation algorithm to select the appropriate data; the algorithm combined with the data to build a recommended model can be applied to practice matches.

Related WorkThere are not many researches on the information technology of large-scale comprehensive sports games [2]. In the process of searching for information, the authors found that many engineering disciplines are involved in the information technology of large-scale comprehensive sports games, but focused on the realization of technology, and the practical application, whether from the point of view of economic benefits or social benefits, could not be implemented [22]. There are several academic studies on the information technology of large-scale comprehensive sports games without focusing on the realization of technology. Li et al.

"present China's sports information awareness is not high enough and investment is insufficient. There is no top-level design or relevant technical standards in the system construction as a whole, and the information system construction is at war with each other, unable to connect and share information. Ziakas [24] introduced the competition information system of Beijing Olympic Games in detail and put forward new requirements for the competition information system in the future. They proposed that the information system of comprehensive events should follow four principles: competition as the core, bundled service, balance between stability and advancement, reasonable positioning, and moderate scale. It is the first time that the information system of large-scale comprehensive competition is defined as a service rather than a simple system engineering construction, which is of great guiding significance to the later work [4].Lei et al. [25] pointed out that the 2008 Olympic Games not only built a huge information system according to the international Olympic Committee (IOC) standard, but also relied on all kinds of open government systems in Beijing, which provided powerful information technology support for the operation of the competition organization of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

In recent years, the emergence of the management system has been fundamentally improved from the past human processing affairs, resulting in long cycle, low efficiency, error omission, and other problems [5]. On the basis of the present, the application system with the computer as the carrier emerges in an endless stream. Compared with the previous manual evaluation method, it has made great progress and provides considerable convenience and solves the problems such as large workload, long cycle, low efficiency, and error omission caused by manual operation. In particular, it can solve the problem of clarifying and concreting the process of competition evaluation and making it more convenient to query the results, thus making the management of sports competition more quick, simple, and accurate.Miles and Shipway [26] concluded from the comparison between the development of sports events and the past that sports events, especially modern sports events, are based on physical movement, constantly challenging the limits of human body, and are the product of civilization and progress of human society. According to Priporas et al. [27], sports events refer to one-time or repeated gathering activities with a certain period of time under the theme of competitive activities, which can have an impact on social economy, tourism development, city reputation, and many other aspects in function.

"or repeated gathering activities with a certain period of time under the theme of competitive activities, which can have an impact on social economy, tourism development, city reputation, and many other aspects in function. The Internet data of sports events covers both sports events and Internet data at the conceptual level. The concept of sports events studied in this paper has been defined above, while the integration algorithm can be regarded as the information that is displayed and communicated through the Internet platform. Data generally refers to the results that can be obtained through observation experiments or calculation and has various forms such as numerical text and images. This research is based on the Internet technology to build a sports event information exchange storage transmission channel. Taking the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and 2008 Beijing Olympic Games as examples, Esposte et al. [28] concluded that large-scale comprehensive sports events should include timing and scoring, on-site large screen, competition command, TV broadcast, information release, and other systems. However, it should be noted that the weak current facilities of China's stadiums and gymnasiums are basically constructed according to general construction standards, which is difficult to meet the complex needs of future events.From the above analysis, we know that the above methods have studied the large-scale sports event management information system widely. However, some problems"
"to general construction standards, which is difficult to meet the complex needs of future events.From the above analysis, we know that the above methods have studied the large-scale sports event management information system widely. However, some problems still exist. For example, no scholar has applied the integration algorithm to this field till now, so the research here is still a blank, which has great theoretical research and practical application value for logistics enterprises [29-32], for example, Beijing Olympic Games ticket sales system and event scheduling system.3. Design and Application of Large-Scale Sports Event Management Information System Based on Integration Algorithm3.1. The Structure of Large-Scale Sports Event Management SystemThe organization management information system of large-scale sports events adopts distributed computing model, and all kinds of organization services are based on communication network and data database service. The system adopts multi-layer architecture, so that the application of the system has greater flexibility and adaptability. On the basis of the lower-level services, specific organization management application modules can be customized for the system. The addition and deletion of some functional application modules do not affect the operation and processing of other parts of the system. For example, the combination of data libraries meets the data requirements of the application layer. The whole system of the method is"
"deletion of some functional application modules do not affect the operation and processing of other parts of the system. For example, the combination of data libraries meets the data requirements of the application layer. The whole system of the method is given in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure of large-scale sports event management system.The system mainly completes the organization and management of human resources in large-scale sports events. The system is responsible for the organization setting and human resources management of the organizing committee, including the recruitment and training of the organizing committee staff and volunteers, personnel assignment, work arrangement, and other management work. The organization and management of human resources in large-scale sports events is to use modern management science to carry out planned recruitment, training, selection, appointment evaluation, and management of employee welfare security, so as to achieve the best allocation of resources. In order to complete the organization and management of logistics support for large-scale sports events, logistics support for large-scale sports events runs through the preparation period of large-scale sports events and the completion period, which is an important guarantee for the success of large-scale sports events.

The system is mainly responsible for the organization and management of information communication of large-scale sports events. The system is responsible for the liaison and coordination of sports events and provides relevant services. It collects and manages information, knowledge, and files related to the competition, edits and publishes all kinds of information products, and is responsible for the project approval and approval of publications of the organizing committee. At the same time, the system also includes information consultation of large-scale sports events and organization and management of media reports.3.2. Integration AlgorithmFDA is a supervised discriminant analysis method, and the main idea is to find the optimal projection direction, which maximizes interclass dispersion and minimizes intraclass dispersion. The intraclass dispersion matrix and interclass dispersion matrix are calculated as follows:(1)(2)In order to introduce LFDA model more conveniently, the equivalent form of FDA algorithm is given on the basis of equations (1) and (2):(3)And(4)And the weight calculation is as follows:(5)And(6)The projection direction of the LFDA model can be obtained by solving the following equation:(7)For the new test data setX, it can be divided into specific categories by the following discriminant function:(8)Since different variable quantum blocks"
"projection direction of the LFDA model can be obtained by solving the following equation:(7)For the new test data setX, it can be divided into specific categories by the following discriminant function:(8)Since different variable quantum blocks may have different effects on fault classification, in order to better depict the differential effects of different subblocks on diagnosis results, the following integrated discriminant function is established by using weighting strategy:(9)The weight matrix is defined as follows:(10)From the above analysis, if the classification accuracy of training data in a subblock is higher, the weight coefficient of the subblock will be higher, and its function in the integrated model will be more important, and vice versa. The ILFDA model can describe the local characteristics of data from two dimensions of sample and variable, highlight the role of sample local information and variable local information in fault classification more comprehensively, and help improve the accuracy of fault classification.

Large-scale sports competition management is the core work of large-scale sports event organization management. All the organization and management activities are for the management of large-scale sports events. Competition management of large-scale sports events is jointly participated by competition managers, athletes, referees, spectators, volunteers, news media, and other participants of sports events. The essence of competition organization and management of large-scale sports events is to manage the competition activities of large-scale sports events, effectively improve the quality of sports events products, and achieve the goals and objectives of sports events.4.

"8 GB video memory, AMD Ryzen 2400G CPU, 8 GB DDR4 software environment: deep learning framework PyTorch 1.7. Python 3.8 CUDA 10.0.4.2. Experimental Results AnalysisFirstly, the comparison of the results of the sport data analysis chart under different time is given in Figure3. After the modeling of the event recommendation model through the above process, it is necessary to compare the sports data of each algorithm model under the same conditions. According to the evaluation method of this experiment, it can be seen that the recommendation accuracy of calculating the event recommendation model is related to the length of the list of events to be recommended and the categories of events browsed by users. Therefore, the length of the list of events to be recommended should be unified during the experimental evaluation.Figure 3(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.Figure 3(b)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.Figure 3(c)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.Figure 3(d)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.Figure 3(e)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.Figure 3(f)Open in figure viewerPowerPointSport data analysis chart.In this experiment, the value range of the list length of the event to be recommended was used to observe the recommendation accuracy of the event recommendation models with different algorithms under the change of the list length.

"experiment, the value range of the list length of the event to be recommended was used to observe the recommendation accuracy of the event recommendation models with different algorithms under the change of the list length. In the experimental results, the accuracy of the event recommendation model of different algorithms is the corresponding variation line graph, indicating the recommendation performance of the event recommendation model of different key algorithms under different input sample data sets.It can be seen from Figure4that the data loading efficiency of network interface in system is different. The comprehensive recommendation model based on HTTP text weight model and OMI series has excellent performance, and the overall recommendation accuracy is about 80%. When the length of the recommendation list is 10 or larger, the recommendation performance is stable and the recommendation accuracy is above 77%. Compared with the content recommendation model based on a single algorithm, the comprehensive content recommendation model can achieve better recommendation performance, and it also verifies that the comprehensive event integration model proposed in this paper has advantages in performance. However, the event recommendation models based on three different single algorithms are different in recommendation performance.Figure 4(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe data loading efficiency of network interface.

The number of recommendation lists tends to be stable within [7,26], and the recommendation accuracy is stable at more than 72%.

"of recommendation lists tends to be stable within [7,26], and the recommendation accuracy is stable at more than 72%. When the length value of the recommendation list is less than 7, the recommendation instability is easy to occur. The reason may be that there is a difference between the user's implicit selection feature mined by o-DF sequence model and the user's displayed selection feature, which belongs to the instability of the algorithm model. It can be seen that, in the actual event recommendation target, the existence of user participation sequence data can better mine the association between users and the event. In the case of a large number of recommendations to be made, a single model is difficult to achieve a good recommendation effect.Figure5shows management efficiency of sports events before and after optimization. The selection of system modules should take into account the needs of special projects of comprehensive sports events and the host city, as well as the operation and management requirements of all departments of the organizing committee. However, it is suggested that the management system should be reused as far as possible, and the development and construction should be started after special needs, so as to better deal with post-game information assets.

"as to better deal with post-game information assets. Operation guarantee is a problem to be considered as a system designer. The schedule should be designed and arranged in advance, reasonably planned in the form of inverted time, and enough time should be reserved for the required actions such as testing and joint adjustment, so that the combination of advanced technology and subsequent matching operation can ensure the complete functional presentation of the large-scale comprehensive games information system. So we need to optimize and upgrade the system.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointManagement efficiency of sports events before and after optimization.As shown in Figure6, we can also see the changes in the efficiency and satisfaction of event management before and after the optimization of the system. It can be seen that, after optimization, satisfaction and management efficiency are improved with the increase of the number of matches. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the analysis system of large-scale competitions.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointDifferent methods for recoloring gray image.According to statistics, there are 4944 event information in the collected data set, among which 2912 event records have been recorded in the recent three years from 2017 to 2019, which also reflects the booming development of marathon and road running in China in recent years.

"have been recorded in the recent three years from 2017 to 2019, which also reflects the booming development of marathon and road running in China in recent years. Statistical description of event data volume is no longer divided into individual years. Among them, there are 617 events with more than 100 participants and 497 events with more than 100 followers. The maximum values of the two events both appear in the data set of Shanghai International Marathon; the top three regions with the most event records are Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, with 611, 516, and 427 events, respectively. A total of 979 events with recorded information have been held in these three regions from 2017 to 2020. It can be seen that the Yangtze River Delta region is the most active region for marathon and road running events in recent years. There are 457 overseas events covering 80 countries and regions, among which the United States region has the most recorded data of 110 events in total.In the data table of competition information, there are 56,057 valid users with 264,079 entries. The average user has participated in about 4.71 events, among which the runner user has the largest number of entries and has participated and recorded 130 marathon events in total.

The users who participated in the event in the data collection were classified and counted as having participated in the event for 3 times and less than 3 times and less than 10 times and more than 10 times and less than 20 times and more than 20 times. The results are shown in Figure7. More than half of the users who participated in the race for 3 times or less and the users who participated in the race for more than 10 times accounted for less than 10% of the total, indicating that a large number of runners in this data set did not participate in the race for many times. Professional marathon runner users belong to a very small portion of this user cluster.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe classification of user participation times.As shown in Figure8, we can see the structure of the actual record of the competition in the system, and the system can record all kinds of information in the competition intuitively and clearly. Modular design of the system in each subsystem coupling degree is low, can be decomposed, and can be combined advantages, The modules of the system are easy to understand, and the system can be split and combined according to the actual needs of large-scale comprehensive events held in China in the future to form a suitable event information system.

In addition, the scheme design adopts a standardized design mode internally, but there is no standard basis externally. From the policy level to promote the standardization of sports information technology, this is one of the directions that needs to continue efforts in the future.Figure 8(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointExample of timing plate.

ConclusionsBased on the data analysis and expert interviews of the competition information system of comprehensive sports events for many years, combined with the actual operation process of the games, the study determined that the selection of system modules, operation guarantee, risk supervision, and control constitute three necessary steps for the design of the competition information system of large-scale comprehensive sports events. It can provide relevant planning suggestions for the subsequent design of the competition information system of large-scale comprehensive sports events. The selection of system modules should take into account the needs of special projects of comprehensive sports events and the operation and management requirements of various departments of the organizing committee of the host city.

However, it is suggested that the management system should be reused as far as possible, and the development and construction should be started after special needs, so as to better deal with post-game information assets.Risk monitoring is a problem that must be considered for many large-scale activities, especially for influential projects such as the people's games; there are many professional researches on risk analysis and response, which need to be advanced over time. Using advanced tools and technologies to reduce the risks of the games is also a worthy direction of future research.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Research on the Supervision System of Sports Events in China, National Social Science Foundation of China (19BTY018).Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Thomson A.,Cuskelly G.,Toohey K.,Kennelly M.,Burton P., andFredline L.,Sport event legacy: a systematic quantitative review of literature,Sport Management Review.

"AbstractNowadays, the hotel management concept cannot keep pace with the times. Traditional concepts are often adopted to manage hotel financial personnel, for the hotel financial personnel cannot take timely and effective training. All these lead to the hotel financial staff designing the hotel's related business without sufficient understanding of the hotel industry and judging and deciding if they do not master the hotel's professional knowledge, which makes the participating projects unable to give correct and reasonable answers to the substantive problems of the hotel. This leads to the hotel management not going up; extensive management makes the hotel benefit not go up. Hotel intelligent technology can solve these problems and not only save manpower and material resources but also intelligently predict the financial crisis of hotels. In the context of the accelerated development of globalization and informatization, there are still many problems in the financial management process of my country's hotel industry. Based on these questions, the article draws on foreign advanced experience, puts forward effective suggestions in financial management, and uses computational intelligence technology to design a centralized and intelligent financial management system.

"intelligent financial management system. The research results show the following: (1) the financial crisis model is created by using the principle of support vector machine and logistic regression method, which greatly reduces the financial crisis of the enterprise. (2) The system can straightforwardly summarize the data for easy query. Taking three domestic hotels as an example, a comprehensive study has been carried out on the three aspects of pricing assessment risk, financial integration risk, and debt risk. In 2016, the financial leverage coefficient has been relatively high, the quick ratio has fluctuated greatly, and the interest protection coefficient has shown a downward trend. (3) The performance of the system is compared with traditional development mode, framework development mode, and intelligent optimization mode. The intelligent optimization system has the lowest response time and the highest success rate. The new system has reduced response time by about 57% compared with the original response time, and the access success rate has been greatly improved.1. IntroductionThe arrival of the information age has given new meaning to hotels. Traditional hotel financial management models can no longer meet today's needs, so it is inevitable to apply intelligence to hotel financial management.

"needs, so it is inevitable to apply intelligence to hotel financial management. Literature [1] pointed out the problems existing in the financial management process of the hotel industry in our country. According to these problems, we need to reform and innovate the existing financial management system and continuously optimize the hotel's financial management system. Literature [2] explains the basic principles of financial management in the hotel industry. Literature [3] proposed an intelligent financial management system. This system is a system designed based on Python. It has many potential benefits. It can help the hotel better control costs, improve the hotel's core competitiveness, and lay the foundation for the hotel's long-term development. At present, most hotels have applied information management to all parts of the hotel, especially in terms of financial management. Whether the hotel has a complete financial management system is directly related to the long-term development of the hotel. Literature [4] proposed a fuzzy-based analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to consider user perception to access decision-making. Use computing intelligence to extract hotel information, establish customer models, realize the hotel's \"customer-centric\" concept, improve the hotel's core competitiveness, and lay a solid foundation for the hotel's long-term development.

"\"customer-centric\" concept, improve the hotel's core competitiveness, and lay a solid foundation for the hotel's long-term development. Literature [5] develops a powerful and reliable model for evaluating the quality of hotel websites. The resulting model can evaluate the hotel's website in an all-round way, which is a very important task for enterprises. Literature [6] tested the application of smart technology in the hotel industry. We conducted a survey of many top hotels in five surrounding cities in China and found that the intelligence of hotels can be divided into three levels. Literature [7] developed a wireless ordering system based on Android phones for the needs of high-end hotel brand marketing services. Literature [8] used sustainable growth models and applied profit and risk graphs based on DuPont equations to investigate whether there is a connection between hotel financial management and management decision-making. We conducted a data analysis on two domestic hotels and calculated the profit of the hotel. The results of the study showed that the management of the manager has a great relationship with the financial situation of the hotel. The article pointed out the methods that the hotel can increase profitability. Literature [9] investigates the core financial analysis capabilities that hotel managers must possess.

"Literature [9] investigates the core financial analysis capabilities that hotel managers must possess. The literature [10] pointed out that recent reports focusing on the future of the global hotel industry have determined that key management issues include the impact of new technologies, lack of capital investment, and increasing attention to the future of the environment. The role of hotel finance director is very important for hotels. In recent years, people's perception of the role of hotel finance director has also changed tremendously. This position is also involved in the hotel's management team. The status in people's hearts has gradually increased. Literature [11] introduces some results of a research project, investigating the role of financial controller in the 10 years up to 1990. Literature [12] introduced the compilation method and indicator analysis of the cash flow statement. Literature [13] examines the combined impact of management response and online comments on hotel financial performance. We have collected a lot of data in the management responses to the online reviews of many online consumers. The research found that a high response rate can improve the financial performance of the hotel, while nonreplying will have a slight impact on the performance of the hotel, so more information should be provided.

"will have a slight impact on the performance of the hotel, so more information should be provided. Reply more to improve the performance of the hotel. Literature [14] investigates the relationship between comprehensive quality management elements and customer attention and financial performance. Literature [15] investigates the relationship between the acquisition amount, the number of acquisition target hotels, and the financial performance of the hotel group after the acquisition. The research results show that the size of the acquisition has a significant impact on the financial performance of the acquirer's hotel, and the degree of impact varies according to different indicators of the company's financial performance. As an important part of hotel operation management, financial management not only involves hotel internal management, cost control, and payment but also affects hotel operation decision. Compared with large hotels, the management of small and medium-sized hotels has certain limitations, poor antirisk ability, and weak financial management awareness of managers, which easily constrains the development of hotels. Science and technology drive the development of human life in the future. Intelligent hotels can meet customer needs in all directions and realize the concept of hotel service first and customer first.

In today's society with expensive human and material resources, intelligent technology has become the future trend of hotel development. Pujie Technology uses artificial intelligence to bring new vitality and new development to the hotel industry and meets the unique experience needs of customers with the principle of customer first.2. Research Background2.1. Research SignificanceDifferent from hotels in the economically backward era, their main function is to provide customers with catering and accommodation services. On this basis, today's hotels are more comprehensively developed into very comprehensive social service organizations. The services provided by hotels are also increasing. Hotels have gradually become an indispensable part of people's lives. Hotels have driven my country's economic development and become my country's third emerging industry, which is closely related to the development of tourism. On the other hand, in large and medium-sized cities, hotel business is a common place for business negotiations and fitness sessions, and the demand for high-quality services is very necessary. The financial management of the hotel means that the financial staff is responsible for the statistics, summary, comprehensive analysis of the results, and conclusions of the various currency and capital exchanges and values collected by various financial institutions or"
"of the hotel means that the financial staff is responsible for the statistics, summary, comprehensive analysis of the results, and conclusions of the various currency and capital exchanges and values collected by various financial institutions or units in the hotel's operating activities, and it is the hotel's general managers who provide information closely related to the management business in order to make correct business decisions. The popularization and development of information technology have opened up a new idea for the financial management of my country's tourism catering service industry. If this information technology is widely used in the financial management of tourism catering companies, it can provide tourism catering companies with more intelligent and automated financial management, including some daily financial and peacetime accounting management; if you make full use of the computer to manage it, on the one hand, you can effectively avoid financial management omissions; on the other hand, it is also for the convenience of inspection. The use of information technology to manage hotel financial data can share and manage the financial data of branches in multiple locations in real time under the premise of ensuring safety, which is very critical and important for hotel group management.2.2.

The Necessity of Hotel Financial ManagementIn the development of China's hotel industry for decades, although it is concentrated in the two aspects of catering and accommodation, the hotel has undergone revolutionary innovation and transformation in many aspects [16]. Any department and hotel operation management are any part of this process, including project management, accounting, capital management, fixed asset management, material and supply management, office supplies and equipment for various functional departments, hotel procurement and leasing contract management, and management of large warehouses, from the purchase of raw materials to processing and later sales of the hotel; any department and hotel management are any part of this process, including project management, accounting, capital management, and fixed asset management.

Analysis of the Status Quo of Hotel Financial ManagementThe traditional corporate finance department is mainly responsible for recording and managing the various expenditures of the enterprise, while the corporate finance department of the new era has more functions, including observation of the market where the enterprise is located and the management of the enterprise based on the existing financial information. Provide strategic advice on future development. The settings include in-depth exploration of financial data and discovering some invisible corporate conditions on the surface. Many corporate financial management systems have been developed abroad. These corporate financial management systems include improvements to accounting and provide good support for voucher management and bank reconciliation.

"to accounting and provide good support for voucher management and bank reconciliation. Some systems can even be connected with other companies in the production chain in the industry, such as Oracle's Financial Analyzer system, which can provide a very friendly management function for traditional corporate finance. The hotel's financial management department has a weak sense of supervision, and many problems have arisen in the hotel's operation process because the hotel's related systems are not perfect and cannot regulate and restrict employees.2.4. Countermeasures and Suggestions for Hotel Financial ManagementFor some modern commercial hotel companies, financial management was an important management content at the time, and it was also regarded as an effective guarantee for the hotel companies' competitiveness in the international market. When our hotel companies want to further improve their own operating efficiency, they need to further enhance their own awareness of financial management significance and importance, and continue to strengthen the supervisory function of financial management workers and the sense of responsibility of employees, so that all employees of our hotel can fully realize the importance of financial management. It is clarified that the financial management work is closely related to the corporate procurement department and its market administrative department, further strengthens the management concept of the corporate financial department,"
"financial management. It is clarified that the financial management work is closely related to the corporate procurement department and its market administrative department, further strengthens the management concept of the corporate financial department, builds a stricter operation and management system, further optimizes the business process of the hotel company, and implements financial supervision, to ensure that the operation and management of hotel companies have more extensive supervision powers and to promote communication and cooperation between other operation and management departments and the financial departments of hotel companies, so as to ensure that the hotel operation and management system and financial management work can be carried out in a regular manner. Moreover, financial management work will also be implemented, helping hotel business management and development work to play a practical effect.2.5. Hotel Financial Management System DesignThe financial part should judge the feasibility of decision-making based on conditions such as market and cost control and maximize the profit of the hotel as much as possible [19]. The financial management department divides positions according to parts and performs their duties. The financial department sets up cashier positions to control the turnover of funds.

"linear relationship coefficientβbetween dependent variableYand independent variableX, which satisfiesY=Xβ. At this time, the dependent variableYis required to be continuous, so it is a regression model. If the dependent variableYis discrete, we need to do another function transformation for thisYto becomeG(Y). If the value ofG(Y) is Class A when it is in a real number interval, Class B when it is in another real number interval, and so on, we get a classification model. In credit risk control, the value of default probability is changeable. By constructing dummy variableYand setting critical value, the value of default probability is transformed into two variables. When the default probability is greater than the critical value, the value is 1; that is, the customer will default; when the default probability is less than the critical value, the value is 0; that is, the customer will not default. Assuming that the probability of dependent variabley= 1 ispunder the given condition of independent variablex, which is denoted asp=P(y= 1 |x), then the probability ofy= 0 is 1 −p, the probability ratiop/(1 −p) of dependent variable taking 1 and 0 is called dominance ratio, and the natural logarithm of dominance ratio is taken; then, sigmoid function can be obtained.This paper puts forward two methods; one is the business model optimization quantification model; the other is the financial crisis early warning model; the financial crisis early warning model is obtained by the"

Debt Repayment Risk Identification3.3.1. Analysis of Short-Term Solvency(a)Analysis of quick ratio indexAdding that the quick ratio is significantly reduced at a certain moment, it proves that the short-term payment ability of the company may be insufficient, and the company may face a greater debt repayment risk [24].

If the business is in good condition and if the enterprise's investment return rate is greater than the debt interest rate, it will get the positive effect of financial leverage. If the enterprise's operating condition is poor, making the enterprise's investment return rate less than the debt interest rate, it will get the negative effect of financial leverage and even lead to the bankruptcy of the enterprise. This uncertainty is the financial risk that the enterprise bears by using debt. The size of enterprise financial risk mainly depends on the level of financial leverage coefficient. Under normal circumstances, the greater the financial leverage coefficient, the greater the elasticity of sovereign capital return rate to EBIT. If EBIT rate rises, the sovereign capital return rate will rise at a faster speed. If EBIT falls, then sovereign capital margins fall at a faster rate,"
"financial leverage coefficient, the greater the elasticity of sovereign capital return rate to EBIT. If EBIT rate rises, the sovereign capital return rate will rise at a faster speed. If EBIT falls, then sovereign capital margins fall at a faster rate, and therefore, the risk is greater. On the contrary, the financial risk is smaller. The essence of the existence of financial risks is that the part of operating risks borne by liabilities is passed on to equity capital because of debt management.3.4. System Performance Test3.4.1.

"the management in all aspects, keep learning, and keep exploring and innovating, and then, you can build a boutique hotel. Strengthen the cultivation of talents, and improve service quality: talent is the most precious resource of enterprises, which has become the consensus of people of insight. Hotel competition is the competition of talents, and talents are the root of hotel survival and development. With the advent of the globalization of Chinese economy, the goal of hotel service in China has gradually changed from nationalization to globalization, and the diversification of customers means the need for diversified professionals. Hotel enterprises need to be employee-centered on the premise of customer satisfaction, because service quality, customer satisfaction, and enterprise performance all depend on employees, and all services are delivered by employees. \"There are no satisfied customers without satisfied employees\" is the consensus of successful hotel managers. Recruiting and retaining talents are the most concerned issue in any industry.Conflicts of InterestThe author declared that there are no conflicts of interest regarding this work.AcknowledgmentsThis work was sponsored by Project of Department of Education of Zhejiang Province (Zhejiaohan[2021]47) and Project of Tourism College of Zhejiang (2019GCC13).Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe experimental data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon"

"AbstractClinical nursing work fails to integrate various nursing tasks such as basic care, observation of patients' conditions, medication, treatment, communication, and health guidance to provide continuous and full nursing care for patients. Based on this, this paper uses the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize the infusion process and achieve closed-loop management of medications and improve the efficiency and safety of infusion and medication administration by using a rational and effective outpatient and emergency infusion and medication management system. The system was built by applying wireless network, barcode technology, RFID, infrared tube sensing, and other technologies and was combined with actual nursing work to summarize application techniques and precautions. The application of this system will become a new highlight of medical informatization, improve patient experience, monitor infusion safety, enhance nursing care, reduce emergency medical disputes, improve patient satisfaction, and will create good social and economic benefits for the hospital.1. IntroductionIn recent years, the increasing number of outpatient and emergency visits; the large number and complexity of infusion patients; the busy, trivial, repetitive, and uninspired work of safe infusion management; and the variety and newness of drugs used have increased the medication insecurity factors in safe infusion management, making the management of infusion rooms more difficult and"
"busy, trivial, repetitive, and uninspired work of safe infusion management; and the variety and newness of drugs used have increased the medication insecurity factors in safe infusion management, making the management of infusion rooms more difficult and unsafe, while the work pressure of nursing staff is increasing [1-3]. How to ensure that patients receive efficient, safe, reliable, and error-free infusion therapy, eliminate various unsafe hazards, and reduce the workload and stress of nurses is a new issue for medical managers. Therefore, the development of patient-oriented outpatient and emergency infusion management system using IOT technology to provide safe and quality medical services to patients and to realize the needs of infusion safety monitoring is gaining more and more attention from hospitals.With the gradual maturation and promotion of IoT technology in China, an outpatient and emergency infusion management system based on IoT technology has been implemented in China. As the frontline of hospital infusion work, the mobile infusion management system is particularly important to meet the medical needs of patients and ensure the safe and effective medical work [4-6]. This system can eliminate medication errors, ensure the safety of patient infusion, greatly improve the efficiency of medical and nursing staff, and enhance patients' trust, compliance, and cooperation with the hospital and the satisfaction of medical and nursing staff.

"ensure the safety of patient infusion, greatly improve the efficiency of medical and nursing staff, and enhance patients' trust, compliance, and cooperation with the hospital and the satisfaction of medical and nursing staff. In order to achieve patient infusion safety monitoring, this paper summarizes the application techniques and precautions of the system, taking into account the application of the system in nursing work and patient satisfaction surveys. The system has fundamentally improved the difficulty of infusion and reduced the unsafe factor of infusion.2. Overall Solution Design of the SystemThe bed medical infusion monitoring system is based on the following characteristics of each patient's life in the hospital:(1)Patients are distributed in the same area during hospitalization, and network wiring and node settings can be distributed in the hospitalization area(2)Each patient has a unique identification code at the time of admission, infusion, and bed call one-to-one, which can facilitate quick and timely handling of problems(3)Each patient has a unique attending physician and charge nurse after admission procedures.

"directly and quickly in the event of an emergency(4)Patients may need to move during the infusion process(5)Patient room calls to ensure accuracy and reliabilityThe system includes three major parts: infusion information collection terminal, ward call system, and PDA handheld terminal. The infusion information collection terminal is mainly responsible for the collection of drop rate, setting the appropriate drop rate value according to the patient's condition, and alarming when the actual drop rate deviates from the normal value or when the infusion is finished. The ward call system is responsible for alarming when the patient has an emergency and needs to contact the medical staff. The PDA handheld terminal system is a system that allows medical and nursing staff to obtain basic patient information by scanning the QR code of the inpatient wristband during ward rounds [7]. Each part uses a different wireless communication method, and each part has an IoT control unit. The part below the control unit is the lower computer, which is responsible for collecting and processing various information and data, and the part above the control unit is the upper computer, which is responsible for storing the collected data and information and displaying it through the remote user terminal.The overall structure block diagram is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointBlock diagram of the overall structure of the system.2.1.

Solution Design of Monitoring Terminal2.1.1. Patient Information Acquisition MethodIt is a routine clinical treatment for inpatients, but it is characterized by tedious and repetitive work. The types of drugs used by infusion patients are different, and the types of drugs are changing rapidly, so nurses may not be able to know the new drugs in time, which brings unsafe factors to infusion work. At the same time, with the increasing awareness of patient self-maintenance, this requires safer and more efficient inpatient infusion work. This is where a new model of wireless infusion system based on RFID technology comes into being, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of RFID-based wireless infusion operation.The RFID system is developed by scanning the patient's wristband and infusion tag with the help of a mobile nursing PDA handheld machine to obtain basic patient and drug information. At the same time, the mobile nursing system also records the information of infusion operation service recipients and service time, and after the infusion is finished, the system automatically prints the infusion result.

This system uses mobile nursing handhelds and barcode technology in many aspects to change and improve the way of operation in the original process links of the hospital, improve the efficiency of medical, nursing, and the service quality of the hospital.2.1.2. Droplet Monitoring Solution DesignIn addition to infusion pumps, a variety of infusion monitoring devices are currently available on the market, and more methods are used. However, the techniques used for infusion monitoring [8] are summarized as follows: liquid level detection method using photoelectric principle: mainly applied to detect whether the infusion is finished or not. The photoelectric sensor is installed on the fixed position of the infusion bottle, and when the liquid level in the infusion bottle drops to the photoelectric sensor position, the photoelectric sensor determines whether the infusion is finished according to the difference of reflection and refraction of light when there is no liquid, but it is not very suitable for bagged drugs in actual use, so it also has great limitations. Using metal electrodes with conductive properties to monitor drug solution, two metal electrodes are inserted into the infusion tube or infusion bottle, and according to the two substances, air and drug solution, which have different conductivity to the metal electrodes, the infusion is detected"
"to monitor drug solution, two metal electrodes are inserted into the infusion tube or infusion bottle, and according to the two substances, air and drug solution, which have different conductivity to the metal electrodes, the infusion is detected according to the different resistance values. However, this method is contaminated to the drug solution and cannot be applied in clinical medical intravenous infusion.Liquid level detection method using the cylindrical capacitor principle, mainly used to detect the remaining liquid volume to calculate the end of infusion time. The capacitor is composed of inner electrode and outer electrode, according to the difference of the dielectric constant of the liquid in the bottle. This method is hygienic and reliable but because the liquid level in the process of falling adsorbed water on the wall of the bottle has a direct impact on the sensitivity of the capacitance sensor. The error generated in the process of use is more obvious, and the specifications of the infusion bottles are also inconsistent, which makes the product development more difficult and therefore does not fully meet the actual needs [9].In this paper, we use the weighing method to detect the remaining liquid to judge whether the infusion is completed. Through pressure sensor, the weight of the infused liquid is measured by a pressure sensor or a spring scale, and then, the change in weight is used to determine whether the infusion is completed. This method is relatively"
"the infusion is completed. Through pressure sensor, the weight of the infused liquid is measured by a pressure sensor or a spring scale, and then, the change in weight is used to determine whether the infusion is completed. This method is relatively simple, but it is subject to certain limitations in actual use and cannot measure the finished amount of infusion and the speed of infusion. This method is relatively simple, but it is limited in practical use and cannot measure the finished amount of infusion and the speed of infusion, so it has some limitations in function.n this project, the droplet speed detection is achieved by using infrared pair of tubes. The average droplet velocity is calculated by counting the pulses collected by the infrared tube. Compared with the electrode detection method, liquid level detection method, and gravimetric method, this measurement method not only has a simple circuit structure, good stability, and easy to use but also has a low price. This method not only has the characteristics of simple circuit structure, good stability, easy to use, and low price but also is more important because it adopts the method of \"infrared\" to measure the drops. And more importantly, it adopts noncontact measurement, which is more environmentally friendly and safer.2.1.3.

Infusion Monitoring Terminal Solution DesignThe infusion information collection terminal is composed of two parts: infusion information collection unit and droplet information processing control unit.

The main functions of the infusion information collection unit include external infrared detection module, microcontroller system, LCD display, drop rate confirmation button, emergency call button, and wireless transmitter module, which mainly realize the functions of drop rate measurement and its display, patient manual control alarm, abnormal infusion process or infusion completion alarm, etc.The structural framework of the infusion information collection unit is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointInfusion information collection and control terminal.The droplet information processing control unit includes a multiplex wireless receiver circuit, a display, a buzzer, and a host computer.

Ward Call System Solution DesignThe ward call system is a comprehensive system project, which should be considered from various aspects such as its function, performance, cost, and application of modern-related technology. Based on such needs, it is suitable to develop a smart medical call system integrating the functions of bed call, bathroom call, and corridor screen display using CAN bus technology.

Communication Solution SelectionWith the continuous maturity of electronic technology and computer technology, wireless communication technology has been widely used. For example, wireless LAN is also used in medical treatment, which is more convenient for medical care.In this project, the following modes are used for wireless networking:(1)Networking Based on ZigBee Technology. Since ZigBee technology itself is suitable for wireless data transmission in a small area, in an environment with a large area and a relatively complex building structure like a hospital ward, the loss rate of wireless signals is inevitably high, and if the data reception and forwarding capacity is improved by increasing the number of terminals, the problem of wireless signal collision and high probability of error code cannot be solved, and it is difficult to establish a large sensor network covering the whole hospital. And ZigBee terminals need to forward signals at any time, the energy requirements are high, and they all use the wired mode of electricity(2)Wi-Fi-Based Networking.

"a large sensor network covering the whole hospital. And ZigBee terminals need to forward signals at any time, the energy requirements are high, and they all use the wired mode of electricity(2)Wi-Fi-Based Networking. PDA handheld devices exchange data and analyze data with the upper management system through Wi-Fi wirelessly, mainly because Wi-Fi technology is a very mature technology; there is no problem in data transmission and reception, which can ensure the stable transmission of patient bedside monitoring data(3)Network Based on CAN Bus Wired Transmission Technology. The ward call system uses CAN bus to achieve data transmission, mainly based on security considerations to ensure reliable transmission, but there are disadvantages such as poor system scalability and the need for wiring in the wardIn response to the above, this project takes the construction of a single ward as an example to build an ultra-low-power, easy-to-use, easy-to-expand clinical medical care monitoring system based on RFID technology.CAN belongs to the category of fieldbus and is the abbreviation of Controller Area Network, which is a serial communication network that effectively supports distributed control or real-time control. CAN communication is not synchronous with clock signals. The use of differential signal transmission has the following advantages:(1)Strong anti-interference ability, when the external noise interference, added to the two transmission lines at the same time, equivalent to"
"is not synchronous with clock signals. The use of differential signal transmission has the following advantages:(1)Strong anti-interference ability, when the external noise interference, added to the two transmission lines at the same time, equivalent to input a pair of common mode signal, so interference noise does not affect the significance of the transmission signal(2)It can effectively suppress its electromagnetic interference to the outside. Two transmission lines are close to each other and equal in amplitude, the amplitude of the coupled electromagnetic field between the transmission. The amplitude of the coupled electromagnetic field between the transmission line and ground is also close to equal, and the signal polarity is opposite, which can cancel each other out and suppress. The coupled electromagnetic field between the transmission line and ground is also close to equal in amplitude, and the signal polarity is opposite, which can cancel each other and suppress external electromagnetic interferenceThe CAN bus was chosen for the ward call system based on the following considerations:(1)The CAN is controlled in a multimaster way. As long as the bus is idle, any one of the units connected to the bus can start sending messages. If two or more units on the bus start sending messages at the same time, the priority can be determined by receiving or blocking the message according to its ID (identifier). If two or more units on the bus start to send messages at the same"
"messages. If two or more units on the bus start sending messages at the same time, the priority can be determined by receiving or blocking the message according to its ID (identifier). If two or more units on the bus start to send messages at the same time, the priority can be determined by receiving or blocking the message according to the ID (identifier) of the message. In the ward call system, the call button located in the ward needs to be pressed only when the patient is in an emergency to send a call message to contact the nurse and not to transmit the message at all times(2)Long distance and high speed transmission can be achieved. When the distance is less than 40 meters, the transmission rate of the CAN bus can reach up to 1 Mbps, and when the transmission rate is less than 5 kbps, the transmission distance of the CAN bus can reach up to 10 kilometers. Calls are generally used in emergency situations, so it is important to ensure high speed and reliable information transmission(3)Ability to automatically check and handle transmission errors. All units connected to the bus have the ability to detect. Any unit on the bus detects an error and immediately sends a notification to the other units on the bus. When any unit on the bus detects an error, it immediately sends a notification to the other units on the bus. The sending unit will immediately force to end the current transmission and start sending again and again until it succeeds(4)There is no theoretical limit to"
"on the bus detects an error, it immediately sends a notification to the other units on the bus. The sending unit will immediately force to end the current transmission and start sending again and again until it succeeds(4)There is no theoretical limit to the number of nodes that can be connected to the CAN bus, but there is a limit to the number of nodes that can be connected, due to bus time delay and load capacity. If the number of connected nodes needs to be increased, the communication speed can be reduced, and if the transmission speed needs to be increased, the number of connected nodes can be reduced. Conversely, the number of connected nodes can be reduced if the transmission speed needs to be increased. For a ward with a relatively large number of wardsThe CAN protocol has a high-speed communication standard ISO11898 for communication rates up to 125 kbps~1 Mbps and a low-speed communication standard ISO11519-2 for communication rates below 125 kbps. The CAN controller determines the signal level on the bus by comparing the difference between the potentials on the CAN_L and CAN_H lines, and the signal level on the bus is divided into two types: implicit level (logic 1) and explicit level (logic 0).2.3.

"for Information Management SystemThe main functions of the clinical medical information management system are to monitor the infusion status of patients in real time, to respond to patients' needs in a timely manner, to understand the situation and needs of each ward, and to realize scientific management of the whole ward and the whole ward, so that the efficiency of medical and nursing workers can be improved, the overall service quality of the hospital can be improved, and medical safety and patient satisfaction can be enhanced. The efficiency of medical and nursing workers is improved, the overall service quality of the hospital is improved, and medical safety and patient satisfaction are enhanced.The information management system is designed with the current mainstream three-layer architecture model, which is mainly divided into data layer, business layer, and application layer. The basic architecture is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointNursing monitoring system architecture diagram.The business functions of the system need the support of data, and through ETL tools combined with API (Application Programming Interface) services in the business, the data is collected from other databases, and the data is classified, collected, quality.

The data will be unified and managed, and a unified access and output standard will be set according to business requirements, forming a big data layer to make each business function more efficient and accurate in actual operation.The data layer includes data acquisition, modeling, and data storage. Data acquisition is done by scanning the QR code through the device, and then, the patient's medical-related data is taken out from the libraries such as HIS and EMR, and through data categorization and modeling, the acquired data related to each business is stored and managed in a unified manner, and at the same time, the data can be output quickly when the interface needs to display the data. The database of the data storage layer needs a good server performance and a high security database system to ensure the security of the data.The business layer is mainly responsible for the functions of application and data interaction and is also the support for business implementation.

"is also the support for business implementation. The terminal uses API to write and call different business logic according to different business requirements. Each operation in the terminal equipment will be pushed to the relevant service point through intermediate messages, and each operation will be pushed to the relevant business function point through the intermediate message function to remind the nurses of their work and improve the efficiency of work.Data application layer refers to the interface operation of the application, mainly according to the business function after calling API services to display the required data, while the user can also enter data, the system will push the relevant information to each terminal, such as the data entered or modified on the PDA will also be updated to the nursing system and the big screen in a timely manner, so that the patient medical information is shared and updated in a timely manner.3.

Performance EvaluationThe reflectivity is usually a function of the grazing angle parameterized by the nurse's operating frequency, as shown in Figure7, and such a plot shows a typical behavior of a rapid increase at very low sick call reflection angles, followed by a plateau region at intermediate angles, and finally a rapid increase as the grazing angle approaches 90 degrees. To illustrate this behavior of the newly proposed empirical model, some of the results already shown are repeated here but as a function of the grazing angle. In validating the use of different distributions in testing these results, the empirical model is based on different distributions represented by only two tables at 30 and 60 degrees. Thus, at lower angles, a better match can be expected.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointOcean reflectance.The system ensures the safety of patient medication and reduces medical risks.

"error rate decreased and was statistically significant, suggesting that the traditional PIVAS infusion process cannot quickly and accurately verify the patient's identity and manually check the drug information, infusion prescription, and infusion label, which can easily lead to verification errors and the dispensing of wrong dosage or wrong medication. However, based on the advanced barcode verification concept and information verification technology, nurses are freed from the busy, stressful, and repetitive manual verification work, which greatly reduces the incidence of medical errors.The confusion matrices for the test sets of NN, AlexNet, ResNet [10-12], and the methods in this paper are shown in Figure8, respectively.Figure 8(a) CNNOpen in figure viewerPowerPointConfusion matrix of the test set.Figure 8(b) AlexNetOpen in figure viewerPowerPointConfusion matrix of the test set.Figure 8(c) ResNetOpen in figure viewerPowerPointConfusion matrix of the test set.Figure 8(d) OurOpen in figure viewerPowerPointConfusion matrix of the test set.The diagonal plot of each confusion matrix in Figure8, which represents the numbers, is correctly classified by the nurses for medical care.

"matrix of the method in this paper has the strongest ability of the numbers being correctly classified. The wireless call unit in the upper part of the infusion seat and the automatic monitoring of the alarmed drip rate and liquid level make it easy for patients to call the nurse at any time when they have a service request (receiving a bottle, removing a needle) [7,13-15].It can be seen from Figure9that the more patients, the smaller the error of nurses, because our system helps the design and implementation of nurses' automatic monitoring. It makes it easier for nurses to take care of patients. This has improved the level of medical automation and made infusion more convenient and safer by overcoming the disadvantages of manual monitoring of fluid levels and flow rates, which consumes a lot of energy and is inefficient. The mobile handheld terminal allows nurses to serve patients in a timely and convenient manner, replacing the old verbal calls, improving the noisy environment in the infusion room, and maintaining order in the infusion site. The results show that the incidence of patients not being called and the rate of nurse-patient disputes are significantly reduced, and the differences are statistically significant.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperation error of nurses with different number of patients.Figure10reports the efficiency of five different nurses at the same length under the system designed in this paper.

"9Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperation error of nurses with different number of patients.Figure10reports the efficiency of five different nurses at the same length under the system designed in this paper. We can clearly know that their efficiency is consistent. The system meets the needs of nurses' mobile office and improves work efficiency. After the system was used, the time for medication review, medication administration check, and rounding sheet writing were all reduced and statistically significant, suggesting that the nurses used the mobile handheld terminal to scan the barcode to check the patient's identity and medication information in the process of setting up, dispensing, injecting, refilling, and finishing the infusion, which ensured the correct identification of the patient and medication safety and greatly saved time. The accuracy and timeliness of infusion records have been enhanced, and the management level of the hospital has been improved [16].Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointMonitoring efficiency of nurses to patients under different length at the same time.5. ConclusionsThe overall framework of the infusion monitoring system was introduced.

"was finally determined that the information collected in the infusion was transmitted wirelessly through the communication network to ensure that the infusion collection terminal was low powered for transmission and could use battery-powered ones. Based on the security consideration of call information transmission, the ward call information is transmitted wired by CAN bus to ensure the reliability of call information transmission. The PDA handheld system is connected to the hospital Internet system in the form of Wi-Fi and interacts with the host computer through different communication modes, respectively.Conflicts of InterestThere is no potential conflict of interest in our paper.Authors' ContributionsAll authors have seen the manuscript and approved to submit to your journal.
