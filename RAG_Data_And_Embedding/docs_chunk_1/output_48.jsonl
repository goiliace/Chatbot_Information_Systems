"departments. The questionnaire included administrative data elements (five classes) and clinical data elements (14 classes).2.3 AnalysisThe Delphi technique was employed for validating the developed MDS model of spinal canal stenosis national registry system. To measure the response of items, a five-point Likert scale was used (very much, much, somehow, little, very little). Moreover, one open-ended question (blank row) was set at the end of the data elements related to each class, to allow the experts to add any extra data deemed essential for the registry. For measuring the questionnaire reliability, Cronbach⍺coefficient was used. The coefficient was calculated for the main group and entire questionnaire. The coefficient obtained for the entire questionnaire was calculated at 86%.To acquire the opinion of experts, the questionnaires were provided to them through in-person visits or email. The experts included faculty members with specialties in health information management, neurosurgery, physiotherapy, and medical informatics. The expert selection criteria were knowledge related to spinal canal stenosis treatment and experience related to the registry of diseases and electronic health records. The selection of experts for the Delphi technique was done through the purposive sampling method.

"branch. In the groups of administrative data, 10 data elements were eliminated out of the 40 proposed ones, due to less than 50% consensus among the experts. The removed data elements were the phone number of patient's place of residence, patient's email, name of the service provider/service registrant, the surname of the service provider/service registrar, the healthcare center affiliation, the relevant medical sciences university, complete address of the healthcare center, the healthcare center email and its postal code. Moreover, 23 data elements related to the administrative data underwent a second opinion in the second stage of the Delphi study due to 50%−75% agreement among the experts. Among the 95 proposed elements for the group of clinical data, only one data element was eliminated, which was the test code. Further, the experts were asked again about 25 data elements, due to 50%−75% agreement over them. The data were related to the medical, individual, and family history of the patient, besides laboratory test, physiotherapy data, exercise recommendation and patient training, data on the disease course and the disease outcome.

It is divided into the administrative and clinical data groups. Most studies on the MDS have also used this classification. The examples include MDSs presented for C-section anesthesia information management system,16traumatic brain injuries,33speech therapy,34cardiac electrophysiology,35patients suffering from pelvic floor disorders,36postmortem computed tomography report for anthropological biological profiling,37and COVID-19 registry.18The reason for this classification has been the different nature and application of administrative and clinical data.

"has been the different nature and application of administrative and clinical data. The first general group of data included administrative data. These data are usually used for identifying patients, registering the healthcare institute or provider specifications, service costs, and administrative reports.18Given the applications mentioned in the present study, the administrative data sets for the spinal canal stenosis registry system included five classes capturing demographic data, socioeconomic data, address, healthcare identification data, and patient referral data. In the class of demographic data, eight data elements had been proposed, all being approved by the experts. The only difference between this class with other similar studies in Iran16-19,38on proposed data elements was the passport number of foreign citizens, due to referral of patients from Iraq and Afghanistan for treating spinal canal stenosis in Iran. Considering the importance of registering socioeconomic data in patients with spinal canal stenosis, for the socioeconomic data class, seven data elements were proposed, all being approved by the experts except for ethnicity. Some of the data proposed in this class had differences from similar studies.36,38Considering the effect of type of occupation on the severity of disease as well as the patient's response to the treatment, four data elements were considered for describing the patient's job.

"the effect of type of occupation on the severity of disease as well as the patient's response to the treatment, four data elements were considered for describing the patient's job. Given the wide extent of occupations, for precise determination of the type of job, it was proposed that the job type be chosen based on the official list of Social Welfare Organization Jobs in Iran.Given the study aim, which was a population registry system, one of the practical data for studying the incidence and prevalence of the disease across different regions was the patient's address. Thus, five data elements had been proposed for the address class, with three of them being approved by the experts. Two of its data including the type of residence and complete address of the patient per each country, province, and so forth had been considered for supporting the epidemiological studies of the disease across different regions. The data and classification of their values were similar to the MDS of COVID-19 registry18and the MDS of the gestational diabetes registry.14The two next classes of the administrative data set belonged to the healthcare identification data and patient referral data. Overall, nine out of 20 proposed data elements were approved by the experts. These data had been proposed for registering the information of healthcare providers and patient referrals, which were similar to other studies.14,18,26The second group of data belonged to clinical aspects.

"by the experts. These data had been proposed for registering the information of healthcare providers and patient referrals, which were similar to other studies.14,18,26The second group of data belonged to clinical aspects. A total of 94 data elements had been proposed in 14 classes, with only one remaining unapproved by the experts. The aim of the classification and proposal of data in each class was to provide important information about the disease risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of the treatment response process, and disease outcome. The first class of clinical data covered the disease signs and symptoms. Since pain is weighed as the most important symptom of the disease,39,40a separate subclass and six data elements were considered for the pain evaluation. Apart from the pain-associated data elements, eight data elements were also considered for other common signs and symptoms of the disease. In chronic diseases such as spinal canal stenosis, the severity and number of symptoms and signs of the disease play a key role in selecting the treatment plan and disease outcome determination (such as postoperative assessment).40Thus, in the registry of vertebral column diseases, a section is dedicated to pain assessment.In addition to the severity of signs and symptoms of spinal canal stenosis, the extent of disability resulting from the disease is also very important in the treatment plan and evaluation of its effectiveness.

"assessment.In addition to the severity of signs and symptoms of spinal canal stenosis, the extent of disability resulting from the disease is also very important in the treatment plan and evaluation of its effectiveness. In particular, in lumbar spinal stenosis, disability evaluation becomes further important.40Thus, a special class had been considered for the data elements of the disease disability. The first data element belonged to the Oswestry disability index score. It is used as a routine standard in the evaluation of pain and disability in vertebral column diseases.41In addition to the Oswestry disability index score, based on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), five data elements were proposed for evaluating the limitation in activities and participation. WHODAS is a well-known instrument for evaluating health and disability worldwide.42Some studies have also shown the effectiveness and validity of this instrument for evaluating the disability resulting from vertebral column diseases.43In our study, the reason behind proposing the evaluation of disability through WHODAS was the feasibility of patient disability status coding with ICF or V chapter (Supporting Information section for functioning assessment) ICD-11. Ahmadi et al. also in designing the MDS of disability health information management system, had proposed ICF for disability coding.24The next class belonged to diagnosis, and included six data elements.

"ICD-11. Ahmadi et al. also in designing the MDS of disability health information management system, had proposed ICF for disability coding.24The next class belonged to diagnosis, and included six data elements. Considering the WHO schedule for the implementation of ICD-11, as well as its pilot implementation in Iran,44attempts were made to set the data elements for registering sufficient details associated with diagnosis, in line with the codes related to spinal canal stenosis and other accompanying disorders.The individual and family medical history included 22 data elements. It had been proposed first for supporting the registry of individual and family risk factor for spinal canal stenosis. The second aim was to register other underlying diseases, which can negatively affect the course or treatment of the disease. In comparison to similar registry systems such as NOR spine12and Spine Tango,11more data elements have been considered for registering the disease risk factors. For example, in Spine Tango, height, weight, and cigarette smoking had been considered as risk factors.11In the clinical data, three classes captured para-clinical diagnostic data elements (medical imaging, clinical laboratory tests, and electromyography). The medical imaging data such as MRI have great value in diagnosing spinal canal stenosis. In our study, five data elements had been proposed for medical imaging, which was similar to other studies conducted in Iran. In our study, the aim of presenting"
"The medical imaging data such as MRI have great value in diagnosing spinal canal stenosis. In our study, five data elements had been proposed for medical imaging, which was similar to other studies conducted in Iran. In our study, the aim of presenting this format for diagnostic data elements such as medical imaging was to facilitate the data collection and registry in a health electronic information system (according to the action code data element). However, in the radiology form of the Spine Tango registry, numerous data elements had been considered for registering complete details of the imaging findings.45For registering the treatment process data in patients with spinal canal stenosis, four data classes of physiotherapy, exercise recommendation and patient education, surgical/invasive procedures, and medication had been proposed. The data proposed in these four classes were similar to the MDS of disability24and the MDS of the HIS.29Treatment of spinal canal stenosis depends on the clinical conditions of the patient, undergoing physiotherapy, patient education, exercise, epidural steroid injections, and surgical treatment.39One of the data elements in these classes was the intended therapeutic intervention code. Use of the code allows for a standard registry of healthcare as well as data exchange between the disease registry information system software and other health information systems such as Electronic Health Record.46Considering the plan of Iran's Health Ministry"
"the code allows for a standard registry of healthcare as well as data exchange between the disease registry information system software and other health information systems such as Electronic Health Record.46Considering the plan of Iran's Health Ministry for EHR development,47a data registry using a standard coding system facilitates data exchange between the information management system of spinal canal stenosis and HER in the future. In the class on surgery and invasive interventions, it was proposed to use ICHI for the coding of interventions. Some studies have shown that ICHI, in comparison to other intervention classification systems, has a better performance in registering the patient's information in the electronic health record.48For a complete registry of the surgical intervention data, in addition to the surgical/invasive procedures class, a separate class had also been considered for registering the complication surgical procedure. In the international registry of vertebral column Spine Tango,11the postoperative complications data elements had been propounded. As the spinal stenosis is most common among the elderly, surgical operation is associated with more risk of unwanted complications.49Complication surgical procedure was classified in two subclasses of early and late complications. The presence of these data elements can contribute to complete registry of surgical interventions.The discharge status class has been proposed for registering the information on"
"procedure was classified in two subclasses of early and late complications. The presence of these data elements can contribute to complete registry of surgical interventions.The discharge status class has been proposed for registering the information on the treatment outcome in hospitalized patients, including two data elements of discharge data and duration of hospital stay. The duration of hospital stay is a kind of useful data for comparing various surgical techniques and evaluating their outcomes.50The last data class in the clinical data group belonged to the course of the disease and the response to treatment. The aim of this class was to register the treatment follow-up and response to treatment information.5 CONCLUSIONThe MDS proposed in this study is designed to support a comprehensive registry of administrative and clinical data of patients with spinal canal stenosis. In this MDS, attempts were made to first emphasize the epidemiological aspects of the disease, and provide the possibility of registering and collecting patient data for various research through a clinical approach. Moreover, the possibility of data exchange between the registry information system software and HER is considered, besides using new classification systems such as ICHI.

"systems such as ICHI. In this regard, two stage of Delphi technique was conducted by the cooperation of 25 experts in various related fields including neurosurgeons and physiotherapist besides the specialists in health information management and medical informatics. The developed model included 120 data elements in two major branches of administrative data and clinical data, each involved 27 and 94 data elements, respectively. The application of this MDS can contribute to establishing a spinal canal stenosis registry system in Iran. It can also provide a higher quality registration of patient information in different healthcare centers.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJavad Zarei: Conceptualization; funding acquisition; project administration; supervision; validation; writing--review and editing.Ali Mohammadi: Data curation; methodology; project administration; writing--review and editing.Mohamad Reza Akrami: Conceptualization.Azar Jeihooni Kalhori: Data curation; formal analysis; investigation; software; writing--original draft.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was part of an MSc dissertation supported by the Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (Grant number SDH-0007).

"AbstractIn order to fully integrate various emergency management information resources for volunteer service, the author proposes a volunteer service participation in emergency management information collection platform based on big data technology. Taking a municipal government as an example, the current situation of information integration in emergency management is investigated and studied, the needs of various departments are analyzed through interviews and questionnaires, and the problems existing in the government's information integration are studied. It tries to build a scientific, reasonable, and operational government information integration model based on theories of government information disclosure, government emergency management, and metadata technology. The survey results show the following observation: In the survey results of \"the reasons that affect the integration of emergency linkage information of a city government,\" the first place is the poor information communication channels between departments, accounting for 22.7%; The second and the third are \"administrative system restrictions\" and \"protection of the interests of the department,\" accounting for 21.4% and 19.4%, respectively. It is worth noting that the technical problem of information management is also one of the important factors affecting the government's emergency response management, accounting for 19.1%.Conclusion.

IntroductionThe history of human development is a history of coping with challenges, overcoming disasters, and making continuous progress. With the development of human society today, the economy, society, and culture have achieved unprecedented prosperity. The increasing generalization and deepening of globalization and modernization have not only brought countless opportunities to human society but also created countless risks. Natural disasters caused by human beings ignoring environmental damage and demanding from nature savagely, it has become more and more frequent, and the economy, society, and nature have entered a stage in which various emergencies have higher probability, greater destructive power, and stronger influence [1]. In recent years, a series of emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, freezing, high temperature, and the spread of highly pathogenic infectious diseases have not only been much more than normal in the past but have also caused more and more serious harm to human life. From the general law of social development, when a country's economy develops to a certain stage, it will enter a stage of frequent"
"have not only been much more than normal in the past but have also caused more and more serious harm to human life. From the general law of social development, when a country's economy develops to a certain stage, it will enter a stage of frequent disasters and accidents with prominent contradictions based on social resources and institutional constraints. At this stage, it often corresponds to the period when the bottleneck constraints of social contradictions such as population, resources, environment, efficiency, and fairness are the most serious, and it is also a critical period in which social and economic imbalances, national psychological imbalances, and social ethics anomie are prone to occur [2]. At present, China is in an accelerated period of economic transition and social transformation, with the continuous deepening of industrialization and urbanization, the pressure caused by the rapid growth of society and economy is increasing, the deterioration of the natural ecological environment, and the cyclical changes in the activities of nature itself; this has led to the frequent occurrence of major natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and freezing of ice and snow in China in recent years, public health events such as SARS and highly pathogenic avian influenza frequently occur, and major criminal cases, foreign-related emergencies, mass violence, and political riots occur from time to time, accidents continue one after another [3].2."
"years, public health events such as SARS and highly pathogenic avian influenza frequently occur, and major criminal cases, foreign-related emergencies, mass violence, and political riots occur from time to time, accidents continue one after another [3].2. Literature ReviewAwajan et al. proposed the definition of \"sustainable\" community, based on the disaster reduction model, the reconstruction model, and the structural cognitive model and expounded on the connotation of \"sustainability,\" it is believed that the impact of sudden disaster events can be minimized through unified and coordinated organization and mobilization of the community public [4]. Lv and Li. proposed a community-based disaster reduction model, fully affirming the important role of the community in disaster reduction processing [5]. Guo studied the positive role of community participation in community disaster reduction work [6]. Tian, and others believe that the important role of volunteer organizations in urban community emergency management cannot be ignored, and the government departments should actively consider and provide an effective emergency participation mechanism [7].

"and assessment method, using a fire impact model to assess the risk factors affecting a given building fire [8]. Khan et al. studied the dynamic risk management model in the fast time-varying system, and constructed the framework of the emergency risk measurement model and risk decision model [9]. Ivanets et al. devised a simplified model for emergency risk management, and it is used to deal with the problem of too many treatment plans and risk sources in emergency risk analysis [10]. Yuan and Zhang studied the risk trust based on the total variation theory based on the trust research angle of emergency risk analysis [11]. Hannoun et al. used the accident risk assessment method in industry (ARAMIS) to analyze safety hazards, proposed an alternative protocol and method for risk reduction and reassessment, and used the odyssey marine accident to validate the proposed method's effectiveness [12]. Huang et al. classified risk analysis, assessment methods, and techniques from the perspectives of qualitative, quantitative, and comprehensive (qualitative combined with quantitative, semi-quantitative), and finally achieved the effect of improving risk management capabilities [13]. Shamzhy et al. studied a diversification technique to analyze and predict the risk of regional maritime emergencies in the United States [14].

"to analyze and predict the risk of regional maritime emergencies in the United States [14]. Hameed and Garcia-Zapirain proposed the uncertainty threat (RMS Probabilistic Terrorism) model of risk management schemes, which defined risk as a functional form; it is used for risk estimation under uncertainty of information [15]. The author mainly adopts the methods of theoretical research and questionnaire survey. In the elaboration of related concepts, theoretical research methods are mainly used, and a simple and concise elaboration of big data technology, emergency management theory, information integration demand theory, etc. The information and data related to this thesis of a city government department are used in the form of questionnaires, and the integrated application of emergency management information in a city is taken as a research case, under the background of big data, the problems, and reasons existing in the integration of emergency linkage management information for volunteer services in a city government are comprehensively expounded, which are used as the basis for the practice of this topic.3. Research Methods3.1. Overview of Government Emergency Management Theory and Practice3.1.1. Basic Theory of Emergency ManagementIntegrated emergency management system is a term commonly used in public safety management, or \"Emergency Management Partnership\" or called \"All Agency Approach/All-agencies Approach\" or \"Integrated Approach\". When emergencies occur,"
"Emergency ManagementIntegrated emergency management system is a term commonly used in public safety management, or \"Emergency Management Partnership\" or called \"All Agency Approach/All-agencies Approach\" or \"Integrated Approach\". When emergencies occur, representatives from different agencies, departments, and all levels of government are required to work together and cooperate with each other and decisions must be made quickly. If there is a lack of a set of planned, coordinated, and unified leadership, it will inevitably affect the government's response speed and adaptability, and it will not be able to implement effective management, as shown in Figure1[16]. Therefore, it is required to establish a chain of command that enables all participants in the emergency management work to work together, called an integrated emergency management system. Emergency management is a dynamic process that includes disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Disaster mitigation includes two meanings: Through preliminary work, we avoid avoidable disasters as much as possible and reduce the impact of unavoidable disasters as much as possible. In China, it is also called disaster reduction and prevention. Disaster mitigation measures cannot prevent disasters from occurring nor can they completely eliminate the vulnerability of a community or area's facilities to all hazards. Therefore, it is necessary to be fully prepared for all kinds of dangers that may occur. The purpose of"
"cannot prevent disasters from occurring nor can they completely eliminate the vulnerability of a community or area's facilities to all hazards. Therefore, it is necessary to be fully prepared for all kinds of dangers that may occur. The purpose of preparation is to ensure the emergency response capability required for emergency rescue of major accidents, mainly focusing on the development of emergency operation plans and systems. The main contents of preparation for extremes are preparation of plans, the establishment of early warning systems, emergency training, and emergency drills. Response is \"all actions to save lives and reduce losses in an incident\". Recovery is after the disaster event is over, the return of disaster-stricken communities and people to normal life and production order before the disaster.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointEmergency management.3.1.2. The Importance of Information Integration in the Modern Emergency Management TheoryIn accordance with the principles of \"comprehensive coordination, professional disposal, territorial focus, and high authorization,\" we scientifically define the relationship between the three levels of macrolevel strategic decision-making, mesolevel campaign command, and microlevel tactical action. However, grasping all kinds of information for the first time is the premise of professional command. In the past, most of the information was obtained by manual submission. Basically, front-line personnel collect information"
"microlevel tactical action. However, grasping all kinds of information for the first time is the premise of professional command. In the past, most of the information was obtained by manual submission. Basically, front-line personnel collect information manually and report it layer by layer. This is not inefficient and it costs a lot of manpower. In the era of big data, the way of information collection has changed from manual collection to information collection through scientific and technological means. Countries around the world have gradually changed the traditional \"human sea tactics\" characterized by huge numbers and huge consumption; instead, by optimizing and integrating various scientific and technological resources, strengthening the research and development of key technologies such as monitoring and early warning, command, and dispatch, and equipment support, as well as the development of complete sets of equipment, accelerated the application of remote sensing, geographic information system, global positioning system, network communication technology, cloud computing, Internet of Things and other technologies, as well as the comprehensive integration and transformation of high-tech achievements, and improved the ability to respond to emergencies in the first time, on the spot and at the first place. For example, through the development of advanced earthquake early warning and tsunami monitoring and early warning systems, millions of people can receive early"
"the ability to respond to emergencies in the first time, on the spot and at the first place. For example, through the development of advanced earthquake early warning and tsunami monitoring and early warning systems, millions of people can receive early warning information several seconds before the arrival of a strong earthquake and shear waves and thousands of minutes before the arrival of a tsunami, providing opportunities for self-rescue escape and refuge. In particular, the advanced subway early warning and automatic shutdown system enabled 27 subway trains operating in the disaster area to stop safely, effectively preventing the occurrence of secondary disasters. Therefore, in emergency management, the premise for scientific decision-making is to quickly, accurately, and comprehensively collect information and present it to decision-makers [17].3.1.3. Changes in Information Integration Work in the Era of Big Data TechnologyData are considered to be the basic means of life and market elements in the new era as important as material assets and human capital. The explosion of information has led to the explosion of the amount of information, and the data accumulated from the beginning of human history to the 1980s are not as good as our current data; the amount of data we generate is very huge, and now, there is a new trend in the era of the Internet of things. In the era of the Internet of things, we often see automatically formed interactions and automatically formed"
"not as good as our current data; the amount of data we generate is very huge, and now, there is a new trend in the era of the Internet of things. In the era of the Internet of things, we often see automatically formed interactions and automatically formed data processing; then, we will target ten times, hundred times, thousand times the equipment or the data generated all the time, this is the challenge of our data, in such a large amount of data, how much value can be really mined from it is actually very limited.The explosive growth of information resources, among which the unstructured data information reaches about 85%, traditional information resource management technology has been unable to cope with the challenges of the big data era [18]. The emergence of big data technology and other big data tools and equipment, as well as the widespread use of cloud computing data processing and application models, provide an efficient, scalable, and low-cost solution for emergency management to deal with the growing mass of unstructured data, it makes up for the shortcomings of traditional relational databases or data warehouses in processing unstructured data, deepens and expands the intelligence and knowledge service capabilities, forms a data-driven decision-making mechanism, and improves the level of decision making.3.2.

"forms a data-driven decision-making mechanism, and improves the level of decision making.3.2. Overview of Big Data Integration TechnologyIn the local government's emergency management information integration work, the information and digital big data environment constitute its external macro environment. The government's internal integration technical means and information communication channels constitute its internal microenvironment; the two together constitute the local government's emergency management information integration environment.3.2.1. Data CollectionIn the era of big data, government information resources are all-encompassing; on the one hand, a large amount of data are generated when interacting with external customers and partners through text information, social networks, mobile applications, etc.. On the other hand, a large amount of information is generated by daily administrative management activities such as internal production, office work, and video surveillance of the government. These information resources are represented in the form of text, images, audio, video, etc., and are a mixture of multimedia, multilanguage, and multitype information. We determine which data sources to select as analysis targets based on project planning and mission objectives, as well as data analysis needs. These data include database design specification, E-R diagram, outline design, system requirement analysis report, and system operation report. The more complete the"
"targets based on project planning and mission objectives, as well as data analysis needs. These data include database design specification, E-R diagram, outline design, system requirement analysis report, and system operation report. The more complete the data collection, the better the understanding of the data and the accuracy of subsequent data integration operations.3.2.2. Data CollationThe collected data may come from inside or outside the enterprise, and the platforms and formats of data sources are not necessarily the same. Different collection and processing methods are required for different data sources. The structure is complex and diverse and it is difficult to unify standards. In the era of big data, the organization of information resources is nonlinear, and hypertext and hypermedia information has gradually become the main way. Information resources on the same server may also differ in data structures, character sets, and processing methods. The complex and diverse structure of big data brings trouble to the establishment of unified standards and norms for information resources and makes the huge amount of structured and unstructured information resources in a disordered state. Standardization and standardization of enterprise information resources are one of the keys and difficult points of future enterprise informatization construction.3.2.3.

"of enterprise information resources are one of the keys and difficult points of future enterprise informatization construction.3.2.3. Data AnalysisResearch shows that the amount of digital information captured and generated in China is expected to increase to 8.5 ZB between 2015 and 2020, achieving a 22-fold growth, or maintaining a compound annual growth rate of 50% [19]. Finding relevant information in petabytes or even exabytes of data is tantamount to looking for a needle in a haystack, and the cost and complexity of using the information to drive decision making is increasing day by day.Generally, people who do data integration systems are not those who used to do operational databases for enterprises. Besides, there are many database systems in enterprises, which are generally completed by different personnel; therefore, it is very difficult to analyze data sources according to the found data, but this is an insurmountable work process and directly affects the quality of the new system. A very fundamental purpose of big data is to have very large storage and very large computing power, which can help us scale out the technologies we need to do.3.2.4. Data ConversionThe process of data conversion is actually the process of data mapping. If the previous steps of data source analysis are done well, then this step is relatively easy. It can be mapped at the analysis topic level, data source entity level, and attribute level.3.3. Investigation of the Existing Emergency"
"of data mapping. If the previous steps of data source analysis are done well, then this step is relatively easy. It can be mapped at the analysis topic level, data source entity level, and attribute level.3.3. Investigation of the Existing Emergency Management Information Integration Model in a CitySplitting and combining ordered information applies a hierarchy pattern. The mode of emergency information application of a city government is a split-type if-type hierarchical system, which is innovative from a single traditional distributed mode and a centralized mode, which meets the information integration needs of a city's emergency linkage management. In this hierarchical structure model, there is a centralized and closed unified scheduler, which centralizes all the emergency information resources in the whole region and then hands them over to the main program, while the regional management information resources and organizational coordination information are passed through another independent is done by the scheduler, it supports the owners of remote information resources to implement specific individual preference schemes for specific external needs; at the same time, it is compatible with the independent maintenance functions of each subsystem; the central system only performs comprehensive overall scheduling for these subsystems, and matters within them retain their own management control.

"functions of each subsystem; the central system only performs comprehensive overall scheduling for these subsystems, and matters within them retain their own management control. Obviously, a city's split and combined hierarchical information processing structure system has well absorbed the advantages of a single centralized unified scheduling and a single distributed independent processing, so the integration of emergency linkage management information is more hierarchical [20] as shown in Figures2(a)-2(c):Figure 2(a)Open in figure viewerPowerPointInformation integration management mode diagram.

"in the information resource integration channels according to the current supply and demand of local actual information, human resources, and other resources, using the split-combined hierarchical model to interconnect the different information integration channels, form an abstract model of emergency management information integration channels, and establish a concrete model according to the government affairs process, that is, the coexistence of multiple integration modes of component order integration, conditional selection integration, repeated integration, and parallel integration. The emergency information management platform of a city has constructed four routing relationships of parallel, condition, repetition, and sequence in accordance with the logical rules of the business processes of each department, so that the entire emergency information integration process has been interconnected, and significant results have been achieved in both the information update cycle and the information communication function. We form an ontology-based global mechanism. Before the establishment of the emergency linkage management office, various government organizations in a certain city used different information reporting and issuing methods to transmit the same information; due to too many transmission channels, it is easy to cause misinterpretation and low accuracy of the information in the process of information transmission; in the end, multiple versions of the same event"
"issuing methods to transmit the same information; due to too many transmission channels, it is easy to cause misinterpretation and low accuracy of the information in the process of information transmission; in the end, multiple versions of the same event information appeared, which undoubtedly had a huge negative impact on the feasibility and integrity of the information; in response to this thorny problem, the information management department of a city government, together with the public security, fire protection, and medical units, conducted an information communication reform attempts. All crisis cases, disposal information, etc., are incorporated into the government's unified split-level business flow model, and the goal of mapping and converting heterogeneous data sources to the global model has been preliminarily achieved. Based on the global mechanism of ontology, enhanced information integration, and sharing among departments across the region, the operation process of the emergency linkage center is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperation process of emergency linkage center.It is obviously reasonable to look at the measures of a city government from a technical point of view, because even if the government manages the flow of information resources in emergency response [21].

"even if the government manages the flow of information resources in emergency response [21]. Data sharing will involve organizations, departments, and information platforms with different permissions. However, after compatible processing through big data network technology, it has become a reality to transform the real \"heterogeneous\" environment into a virtual \"homogeneous\" environment, it can combine the same emergency management information with different description semantics; after the global integration mechanism based on the same ontology is transformed into the integration problem of different modes, the information is finally transmitted accurately, and the effective optimization and integration of various information resources are finally realized for scientific scheduling and management.4. Analysis of Results4.1. Survey Objects and ProcessThis survey uses the questionnaire method and interview method to conduct field investigations on some government agencies in a city. The general object of the investigation is the current situation of emergency linkage information integration of a municipal government. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed, 335 valid questionnaires were recovered, and the questionnaire recovery rate was 95.7%. Among them, 300 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the staff of functional organizations; 50 interview questionnaires were distributed to leading cadres.

"recovery rate was 95.7%. Among them, 300 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the staff of functional organizations; 50 interview questionnaires were distributed to leading cadres. The processing of the questionnaire data adopts Visual FoxPro, Excel, and other software for statistical verification.The basic idea of the paired samplettest is to set the populationX1to obey the normal distributionN(μ1,σ12), and the population to obey the normal distributionN(μ2,σ22), samples (x11,x12, ...,x1n), and (x21,x22, ...,x2n) are drawn from these two populations, respectively, and the two samples are paired with each other. It is required to test whetherμ1andμ2are significantly different. Specific steps are as follows:(1)Introduce variablesIntroduce a new random variableY=X1−X2, the corresponding sample value is (y1,y2, ...,yn), whereyi=x1i−x2i(i= 1,2, ...,n).(2)Establish the assumption as follows (1)(1)(3)Calculation formula and meaning(2)whereis the mean of the paired sample differences;is the standard deviation of the paired sample differences; andnis the number of paired samples.This statistictfollows a t-distribution withn−1 degrees of freedom under the condition that the null hypothesis (μY= 0) is true.4.2.

"Design and DistributionThis questionnaire consists of 25 closed-ended questions and 5 semi-open-ended questions; the main contents include survey on the information communication platform of government departments, a survey on information sharing willingness of various departments and staff, a survey on the overall level of information sharing in a city including public security, finance, human resources, and education systems, and a survey on the influencing factors of information sharing by government functional departments.4.3. Questionnaire Survey Results4.3.1. Lack of the Information Integration PlatformCompared with the information sharing platforms owned by the administrative systems of the more developed cities in China (as shown in Table1and Figure4), it can be seen that the number of information sharing platforms in the administrative system of a city is very lacking and can only basically meet the requirements of its jurisdiction. Information sharing needs. The data comparison shows that the public security system with the most information sharing platforms in a city differs by 21 units from the public security system in developed cities. The number of information sharing platforms for information management systems in a city is 30, while that in developed cities is 78, a difference of 48 units.

"systems in a city is 30, while that in developed cities is 78, a difference of 48 units. The education system has the least number of platforms in a city's administrative system, with only 9 platforms, the administrative system with the least number of platforms in a developed city is the civil affairs system, with 37 platforms, 28 more than a city. These numerical gaps basically reflect the gap between a city's information sharing hardware and other developed regions in China.Table  1.Number of government information management platforms in some developed cities.Department nameNumber of emergency management platforms (unit: units)Network equipmentDegree of information sharingPublic security system63High qualityGeneralFinancial system43High qualityHighCivil affairs system37GenerallyHighEducation system38High qualityHighInformation management system78PremiumHighFigure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe number of some government information management platforms in a city.4.3.2. Not Willing to Share InformationRegarding the disclosure and sharing of daily common information of government departments, more than 50% of units or individuals believe that cross-departmental information sharing is necessary and feasible; However, when it comes to the core interests of the department, such as the property of officials and the specific procedures of the disaster relief plan, the vast majority of departments are still opposed.It shows that despite the background of big data, there are"
"it comes to the core interests of the department, such as the property of officials and the specific procedures of the disaster relief plan, the vast majority of departments are still opposed.It shows that despite the background of big data, there are still many departments in the consideration of departmental interests, and reluctance to provide the department's data. In fact, the data are not only the appearance of information gaps between departments but also reveal some hidden reasons behind the reluctance of various departments to share their own departments with other departments. Based on their own short-term interests, many departments usually treat information sharing in a conservative manner and are unwilling to share their own information and data, which directly leads to the fragmentation and isolation of emergency management information. There are also department leaders or managers who have a relatively shallow understanding of the application of big data technology and are overly worried about the risk of leakage of departmental confidential information caused by information sharing. The deep-seated reason why some departments are reluctant to share information across departments is that the business of this department is completely different from that of other departments, and its powers and responsibilities are irrelevant; therefore, there is a bystander attitude of \"everyone sweeps the snow in front of the door, and does not care about the frost on other"
"department is completely different from that of other departments, and its powers and responsibilities are irrelevant; therefore, there is a bystander attitude of \"everyone sweeps the snow in front of the door, and does not care about the frost on other people's tiles\". In addition, based on privacy protection considerations, many government departments are reluctant to take the risk of information leakage due to information sharing and would rather sacrifice convenience than share information [22]. Therefore, in actual operation, the level of information sharing between departments is extremely low; it can be said that the information communication channels between horizontal government departments are not smooth.4.3.3. The Reasons That Affect the Integration of Emergency Linkage Information Are ComplexAccording to the survey results of \"the reasons that affect the integration of emergency linkage information of a city government\" (see Figure5), the first is the poor information communication channels between departments, accounting for 22.7%. The second and third are \"administrative system restrictions\" and \"protection of the interests of the department,\" accounting for 21.4% and 19.4% respectively. It is worth noting that the technical problem of information management is also one of the important factors affecting the government's emergency response management, accounting for 19.1%.

"the technical problem of information management is also one of the important factors affecting the government's emergency response management, accounting for 19.1%. Obviously, the factors affecting the integration of emergency linkage information of a city government are both objective and subjective, both internal and external. It can be said that the influencing factors are complicated and summed up as follows: China's current government organizations are slightly bloated, with too many management levels and confusing powers and responsibilities, which will inevitably increase the number of information transmission links, which is quite unfavorable for the dissemination of work information; otherwise, the accuracy of many critical emergency information will be affected to varying degrees, which will inevitably affect the management of emergency linkage information and the progress of crisis disposal. There are information gaps between various departments and lack of crisis management mechanism, as a result, the existing emergency linkage management information system faces greater difficulties and challenges, and the theoretical collaborative combat effectiveness has not been fully reflected in practical operations. Furthermore, the top-down one-way one-line communication method is too simple, if all emergency linkage information is top-down one-line communication, the speed of information dissemination will be slow and the feedback information will be less. In addition,"
"the top-down one-way one-line communication method is too simple, if all emergency linkage information is top-down one-line communication, the speed of information dissemination will be slow and the feedback information will be less. In addition, in the reporting of crisis accident information, in order to maintain the performance and interests of the department, local government departments usually report lightly or delay reporting, resulting in the dilemma of unbalanced emergency information. Under the management system of the existing traditional government departments, various units and departments of local governments still have difficulties such as lack of unity, information occlusion, and poor management communication and coordination in the public crisis, after forming a pattern of police and civilians, participation in multiple subjects, and multisector linkage; however, in terms of actual operation, it is far from exerting emergency linkage management.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointA survey of the reasons that affect the integration of emergency linkage information in a municipal government.5.

"flow, workflow, and responsibility flow; there are still some problems in practice, especially in the field of social management difficulties with relatively lagging law and system construction, and cross-responsibilities; some line departments have the responsibility of drilling legal vulnerabilities and \"inaction in accordance with the law,\" which leads to \"connect\" in form, but it cannot be \"moved\" in the solution mechanism of the problem. Second, the integration of human resources is very difficult to be restricted by the interests of the department. We analyze the main disadvantages and reasons of existing sharing models. At the same time, in combination with the application methods of big data in other industries, we analyze the needs of data sharing in the field of emergency management, so as to build a reasonable information sharing work model.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis study was funded by the 2021 University Philosophy and Social Science Research Project in Jiangsu Province: Research on the Mechanism of Cultivating the Core Literacy of Contemporary College Students by Volunteer Service in the New Development Stage, project no: 2021SJB0084.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Chen H.,Zhang Y.,Du Y., andCheng Q.

"AbstractEnterprise management resource protection is a system management activity in which an enterprise conducts comprehensive planning, allocation, utilization, and development of its resources, and it is the process of organizing, planning, coordinating, supervising, and controlling the allocation, utilization, and development of enterprise resources. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the system that digital information technology applies to enterprise management by constructing models and combinations based on digital information technology so that the built models and combinations have a more effective analysis and research. This paper first gives a general introduction to digital information technology, then analyzes the theory of enterprise management resource protection, then establishes a model for information technology to act on enterprise management, and finally analyzes the combination of information technology and enterprise management and compares the two through enterprise case analysis. The experimental results show that in the case of enterprise management in various regions, the efficiency of enterprise management based on digital information technology is obviously higher, and the enterprise resources can be better protected. From 2018 to 2021, the development of enterprise management resource protection in various regions is basically showing an upward trend; it increased from 3.443, 5.414, 6.473, 4.382, 2.997, 3.751, 0.506, and 2.974 in 2018 to"

From 2018 to 2021, the development of enterprise management resource protection in various regions is basically showing an upward trend; it increased from 3.443, 5.414, 6.473, 4.382, 2.997, 3.751, 0.506, and 2.974 in 2018 to 6.187, 7.658, 8.601, 7.518, 5.932, 6.516, 3.877, and 6.243 in 2021. This is a good demonstration of the effectiveness of the protection of enterprise management resources based on digital information technology.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of the domestic economy, the protection of enterprise resources in enterprise management has become a hot issue in the current business circle. Many scholars believe that resources are an important factor that increases people's work pressure, which in turn affects people's physical and mental health. In recent years, scholars have paid more and more attention to the theoretical research of enterprise resource protection based on enterprise management. Digital information technology mainly uses geographic information system, communication network, and multimedia technology to build a digital system, so as to organize, process, transmit, query, and display the collected information, in order to assist the decision-making in enterprise resource protection in enterprise management and comprehensively guide the progress of enterprise management resource protection.Today, with the rapid development of Internet technology, the whole country is a \"digital city.\" This paper uses digital"
"resource protection in enterprise management and comprehensively guide the progress of enterprise management resource protection.Today, with the rapid development of Internet technology, the whole country is a \"digital city.\" This paper uses digital information technology to provide a technical support for solving the problem of enterprise resource protection in enterprise management, provides a standardized and scientific information management for it, and builds an effective enterprise management system. This also has a very far-reaching impact on the development of the enterprise. The application scope of digital information technology is very wide, and the use of digital information technology can meet the comprehensive management of enterprises. But in recent years, the research on digital information technology for enterprise management is relatively less. Therefore, the application of digital information technology to the research of enterprise management resource protection has certain theoretical and practical significance.2. Related WorkWith the progress of society, more and more people have studied digital information technology. Theis proposed that \"Moore's Law\" will open a new era, and the focus of information technology research and development will shift from miniaturization of time-honored technologies to coordinated introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures for computing [1].

"technology research and development will shift from miniaturization of time-honored technologies to coordinated introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures for computing [1]. However, many such studies have emerged and may be lacking in innovation. Later, Habib studied the use of mathematical information automation technology to carry out a new management of higher education institutions and successfully provided experience to higher education academia [2]. However, this research system still has some limitations, and it has not been able to successfully identify the characteristics of the system. Wang studied the hypothetical association between digital birth and four common IT addictions. He employed a multidimensional digital information technology approach to compare the associations between specific attributes of digital soundtracks and each type of IT addiction [3]. However, it is clear that the final results did not reach the expected state, and further research is needed. Following this, Li studied the use of these modern information technologies in libraries for common applications through a case study of digital libraries in China. He concluded that artificial intelligence can improve the service level of existing digital libraries from three aspects: resource construction, information organization, and information service [4].

"can improve the service level of existing digital libraries from three aspects: resource construction, information organization, and information service [4]. However, the cases he studied were too scattered to fully present his views. Based on research by academics, Given found that the digital technologies used by humanists support traditional ways of working within their disciplines, while also creating potential for new academic practices. The heterogeneous nature of the research practices of humanities scholars is explored and thus has implications for the design of digital tools [5]. However, his research does not take into account the practical significance and is too theoretical. Through his research results, Vanpoucke proposed the use of information technology and found that more and more companies exchange information with each other in order to better cooperate closely with supply chain partners. In his paper, he showed that information exchange was indispensable for business integration [6]. However, such studies are too complex to be appropriate as survey studies for small companies. Subsequently, Yadav studied the design of an optimal low-power digital phase-locked loop.

However, this design is not yet complete and has not yet been applied in practice.The innovation of this paper is as follows: (1) In the enterprise management resource protection project, digital information technology can be used to quickly collect, process, integrate and process resources, and then transmit and display them. It is convenient and effective to apply digital information technology to enterprise management, and it can also better conduct a comprehensive management of enterprises. (2) Creating two models for comparison to get better test results. In addition, the advantages and characteristics of digital information technology are deeply studied, and the effective function of applying it to enterprise management resource protection is found out, so as to obtain a better system combination of digital information technology and enterprise management resource protection.3.

"is a science and technology that accompanies electronic computers. It refers to a technology that converts various information (such as picture, text, sound, and image) into binary numbers that can be recognized by electronic computers with the help of certain equipment and then operates, processes, stores, transmits, propagates, and restores the numbers [8]. It is also called digital technology, computer digital technology, etc., because it is necessary to use computers to encode, compress, and decode information in operations, storage, and other links. Digital technology is also called digital control technology. Information technology (IT for short) refers to the technology that expands human information functions under the guidance of the basic principles and methods of information science. Generally speaking, information technology is the sum of technologies that realize the functions of information acquisition, processing, transmission, and utilization as the main means of electronic computers and modern communication; it is also a general term for related methods, means, and operating procedures for the management, development, and utilization of information resources.3.1.2.

Overall, the application of informatization to enterprises is very effective [10].3.1.3. Digital Information Technology and Enterprise ManagementIn the new era, enterprises are facing the challenges of intensified competition and accelerated innovation. In this context, mastering digital information technology becomes more and more important. First of all, digital information technology can expand the information sources of enterprises and enrich the innovation resources of enterprises. This effect is not only reflected in technology, but also in the market, and this is the key point that enterprises value most.

Digital information technology has the function of innovation and integration of different professions.3.2. Enterprise Management System3.2.1. Concept of Management SystemThe enterprise management system mainly stipulates the functional scope, responsibilities, authority, and working procedures and methods of management of various management departments, management positions, and various professional management businesses [11]. The value of enterprise management lies in enabling different employees to work together to achieve enterprise goals; the management system can be regarded as the sum of the rules for regulating and coordinating the behaviors of various departments and personnel, integrating resources, and constraining and adjusting various behaviors and their relationship with resource elements in business management activities [12].The management process is also an indispensable part of the enterprise, and the management system can co-evolve with the management process as"
"adjusting various behaviors and their relationship with resource elements in business management activities [12].The management process is also an indispensable part of the enterprise, and the management system can co-evolve with the management process as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe management system is more dependent on the vertical level of the organizational structure, and the process operation is more inclined to the horizontal coordination between departments. The two are parallel in the management system and do not conflict. In practical applications, the two are often combined.3.2.2. Management systemIn the management system, it is assumed thatYandXare two topological spaces;Z:Y⟶Y,V: X⟶X are the self-maps ofYandX, respectively. If there is a homeomorphism c fromYtoX:Y⟶X, makec[Z(T)] =K[c(T)]; then,ZandKare said to be topologically conjugated, denoted asZ~K.

Then, the following differential equations can be obtained:(11)Assuming that the function on the right-hand side of the equation is considered in a system of m-dimensional constant coefficient linear differential equations, assuming that B is a 22-constant square matrix, andYis simplified to a two-dimensional columnwise number, we can obtain(12)Then, the solution that satisfies the initial conditionY(0) =Y0is(13)Not only that,ϕ(A,Y0) also has the following properties:(14)For the convenience of analysis, we consider a two-dimensional constant coefficient dynamical system.

Management Process DesignThe definition of process design is mentioned in the literature review part of this paper, and some are listed in Table1. The management business process realizes the implementation of most management systems through the content decomposition of the specific business process and the objective description of the time and space requirements.

Employees' Awareness of the Management SystemThe compilation of management system is the main form of management system. For example, Company P is an enterprise with only a few hundred employees, and its system compilation is complex, with 15 articles, 154 chapters, and more than 400,000 words, and it is ready to be further expanded. Such a compilation of management systems, even corporate executives may not have the patience and time to read them through [16]. The employees' attention and understanding of the management system also determine its performance effect.

Theory of Enterprise Resource Protection3.3.1. The Theoretical Significance of Resource ProtectionThe theory of resource protection means that enterprises maintain, protect, and gather resources with all their strength and the threat that enterprises face is that they will lose or lose these precious resources. Assuming that the enterprise faces the threat of resource loss, lacks resources, and does not get the corresponding resource return after investing a lot of resources, it will promote the psychological pressure of employees [17]. However, other resources can be used to offset the negative impact of the lack of resources, and enterprises can replace resources. For example, re-employment of people can greatly reduce the feelings of depression and anxiety caused by long-term unemployment. If people cannot directly replace the resource, indirect or symbolic replacement methods can be used.3.3.2. Resources in the Theory of Enterprise Resource ProtectionEnterprises will seek the resources they need according to the order of physical resources, social resources, and psychological resources.

"to the order of physical resources, social resources, and psychological resources. Through the resource conservation theory, maintaining and gathering resources is the main purpose of the enterprise. Therefore, enterprises will not only protect the resources because of the value generated by the resources themselves, but also because the resources help enterprises obtain and protect other meaningful resources. In the theory of \"resource protection,\" resources include physical objects, personal characteristics, identities, abilities, and other resources that employees value, as well as physical objects, personal characteristics, situations, or abilities that enable employees to obtain precious resources [18]. According to the relevant data, the resource protection model can be drawn as shown in Figure4. It can be seen that a successful enterprise adaptability strategy is to make a circular input in resources to obtain resources.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint4. System Demonstration of Enterprise Management Resource Protection after the Application of Information Technology4.1. Information Technology Panel Model4.1.1.

"enterprise resources. However, the impact of information technology on total factor enterprise resources is not a simple linear relationship and may show a nonlinear relationship with the changes of heterogeneous factors such as the level of information technology and human capital of enterprises in various regions. In order to further judge whether heterogeneous factors such as information technology level and human capital level will cause the influence of information technology on total factor productivity to be nonlinear, this paper uses the panel threshold model to test [19].There are many variables in the model, such as the degree of opening to the outside world (FDI), the level of marketization (Mar), the level of human capital (Huma), and the level of industrialization (Indu). The descriptive statistics for these variables are shown in Table3: It can be seen that the marketization level (Mar) has the highest average value of 1.636, indicating that it is most deeply influenced by information technology.3.Descriptive statistics of variables.VariableThe meanThe standard deviationThe minimum valueThe maximumTotal factor productivity (TFP)0.0050.011− 0.0150.037Technical efficiency (TEC)− 0.0030.004− 0.013≤0.001Technological progress (TCH)0.0110.012− 0.0140.045Information technology (IT)4.7922.197− 1.9379.399Openness (FDI)− 4.3611.069− 8.232− 2.606Marketization level (mar)1.6360.3220.2672.328Human capital level (Huma)0.5560.0960.3020.862Industrialization level"

And according to the test results, the choice of model (1) is more suitable. From the results, the elastic coefficients of the degree of opening to the outside world, the level of marketization, and the level of industrialization are 0.0002, 0.0007, and 0.0017, respectively, and they all passed the 5% significance test. This shows that the degree of opening to the outside world, the level of marketization, and the level of industrialization have a significant positive impact on technical efficiency.4.Panel regression results of information technology on the technical efficiency of enterprise resource protection.Variable(1) FE(2) REIT− 0.0016∗∗∗ (− 18.484)− 0.0022∗∗∗ (− 13.075)FDI0.0003∗∗ (2.262)0.00045∗∗∗ (3.407)Mar0.0008∗∗ (1.974)0.0008∗∗ (2.224)Huma(0.798) Indu 0.0018∗∗∗(2.338) 0.0021∗∗∗Constant(3.493) − 0.0092∗∗∗(3.386) 0.0109∗∗∗F/Wald testHausman test347.32188.61∗∗∗1132.27ObservationsR-squared3900.83043900.8246Note:∗,∗∗,"

It can be seen that this is very different from the above. This shows that information technology can change the impact of technological progress on enterprise resources by coupling other factors. From this, it can be concluded that improving absorptive capacity will help to improve technological progress through opening to the outside world [21].5.Panel regression results of information technology on the technological progress of enterprise resource protection.Variable(1) FE(2) REIT0.0006∗ (1.708)− 0.0012∗∗∗ (− 13.074)FDI− 0.0001∗ (− 0.362)0.00054∗∗∗ (3.436)Mar0.0049∗∗∗ (1.983)0.0009∗∗ (2.234)Huma(0.797) Indu 0.0017∗∗∗(2.439) 0.0020∗∗∗Constant(3.462) − 0.0092∗∗∗(3.395) 0.0138∗∗∗F/Wald testHausman"

Information Technology Centralized Verification of the Implementation Effect of Enterprise Resource ProtectionInformation technology can promote technological progress by accelerating the speed of technology introduction and diffusion [24]. The rapid development of information technology has greatly accelerated the speed of information exchange between enterprises and strengthened the technical exchange and cooperation between enterprises. The development of information technology provides a platform and channel for the introduction and diffusion of technology so that enterprises in less developed areas farther away have the opportunity to contact and learn advanced technology and increase exchanges and learning in technology, so as to help narrow the differences in the technical level of enterprises between regions and achieve balanced development.

The operation of centralized accounting of information technology also helps to strengthen the management and effect of the head office on the prefecture and city branches. Compared with before operation, the leaders of the head office can conduct pre-examination of large-amount matters in information technology accounting and increase supervision and control. At the same time, the financial information system can automatically generate vouchers, and the information technology only needs to check whether the automatically generated vouchers are correct, and there is no need to manually enter the account and amount, which reduces the subjective error of vouchers and improves the quality of enterprise resource accounting.According to the model system created above, we investigated the data of Company P from 18 to 21 years before and after the implementation of centralized accounting, and obtained Figure8and the conclusion: Since 2020, when the centralized accounting of information technology was implemented, the cost and expense ratio of Company P decreased from 66.85% in 19 years to 53.4% in 20 years.

DiscussionThis paper is devoted to research and design based on digital information technology and applies it to the complex analysis and processing of enterprise management resource protection. For the research of digital information technology, this paper starts by introducing the concept of information technology, then establishes two models for comparison, and successfully combines improved enterprise management resources and information technology. In the stage of empirical analysis, the created model is used to analyze enterprise instances, and the results show that the obtained results are in line with the actual situation.Through the analysis of this case, it is shown that the enterprise management resource protection combination based on digital information technology is more effective than a single type of resource management and enterprise managers apply digital information technology to implement management. In this way, the loss of enterprise resource projects can be greatly reduced, and optimization decisions of multi-project portfolios can be made.

ConclusionsThrough the case study, important conclusions were drawn: In the current enterprise management mode, using digital information technology, enterprise managers can more effectively prevent the loss of enterprise resources and better protect the cycle of enterprise management resources. As the two models created in this paper, according to the change of enterprise resource parameters after the use of information technology, a more detailed study and quantitative analysis of the protection of enterprise management resources based on digital information technology are carried out, and it determines the role and way of introducing information technology.

"AbstractThe supply chain is an organization alliance formed by the aggregation of many enterprises and based on the information flow to realize the coordinated operation of all links between enterprises. Therefore, enhancing the information synergy between enterprises is a weapon to enhance the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. The introduction of information management technology is the technical support and fundamental guarantee to realize the supply chain information synergy capability. The introduction of blockchain solves the two main problems of traceability and irreversibility of transactions in the supply chain, which can effectively improve the transparency of the supply chain. Transparency, as an important point for all stakeholders in the supply chain, can ensure that product information can be viewed and obtained in a timely manner. The purpose of this article is to analyze the role of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system by observing and analyzing the methods of modern city governance information management system and to understand the application and development prospect of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system. The comparison of the blockchain before and after the implementation of the modern city governance information management system and the research on the application and development of the blockchain in the modern city governance information management system were analyzed."

"As a basic technical support, Bitcoin is the technical guarantee for Bitcoin's decentralization, intelligence, and security operations. Since the concept of blockchain was proposed, the academic community has not yet given a unified definition. The formal definition of the blockchain is as follows: as a basic data protocol, the blockchain can be regarded as a distributed database, even for the operator of the database node; it is also a continuously growing and unchanging data system. This article believes that the blockchain is composed of blocks connected in chronological order. It does not need to rely on third-party agencies to provide trust. Using technologies such as cryptography and mathematical methods, a highly secure and memorable distributed shared database can be ensured. The emergence of decentralization effectively solves the above problems, not only eliminates intermediate costs and reduces the economic pressure of users but also greatly reduces the intermediary caused by delays, and realizes point-to-point information transmission and value transmission. The increase in time also increases the economic benefits of users [1]. For example, a poverty-stricken county has introduced the smart beekeeping technology of \"Alibaba Cloud IoT + blockchain traceability\" and deployed smart beehives, video surveillance, environmental monitoring poles, large data screens, and other equipment, as well as a blockchain traceability platform and a collaborative production and"
"of \"Alibaba Cloud IoT + blockchain traceability\" and deployed smart beehives, video surveillance, environmental monitoring poles, large data screens, and other equipment, as well as a blockchain traceability platform and a collaborative production and sales traceability platform. Poverty was lifted out of the honey industry.Blockchain technology has the characteristics of high transparency, decentralization, trustlessness, collective maintenance, and anonymity. In this system, free and flexible value transfer activities can be realized without the credit provided by other credit institutions. Taking the online bank transfer process as an example, in addition to registering relevant information, you must also fill in the beneficiary's account name, the beneficiary's bank name, ID number, signature, and many other information. In addition, because banks need to process and verify related information and processes, relevant institutions and personnel need to invest a lot of time and energy, which restricts the realization of process effectiveness. Decentralization is different. Only limited information needs to be entered, such as the address of the counterparty and transaction amount, and the value transfer can be completed in an instant, which effectively improves the deficiency of the existing credit mechanism and maximizes time effectiveness. Smart contracts consist of a series of codes. According to the code setting, when the conditions are met, the conditions can be"
"in an instant, which effectively improves the deficiency of the existing credit mechanism and maximizes time effectiveness. Smart contracts consist of a series of codes. According to the code setting, when the conditions are met, the conditions can be automatically identified, judged, and executed without any intermediary involvement [2].Applegate and other scholars found that once the execution cannot be stopped, the essence of the agreement is an independent agreement, which is an effective technical means to achieve the exchange of target values and avoid interference from external factors. Smart contracts are similar to contract systems, but different from ordinary contracts as we know them. How to ensure that the blocks and timestamps in the blockchain are linked in chronological order is discussed [3]. The timestamp is the \"timestamp\" of each transaction, which effectively solves the problem of repeated payments, so that each transaction can be traced back to the source, and has the characteristics of nontampering and nonforgery [4].This article uses the method of experimental research to understand the role of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system, as well as the comparative exploration before and after its use. Through theoretical analysis and experimental exploration, find out the function and process data through data recording, sorting, calculation, mapping, analysis, and simulation through the blockchain in the modern city"
"before and after its use. Through theoretical analysis and experimental exploration, find out the function and process data through data recording, sorting, calculation, mapping, analysis, and simulation through the blockchain in the modern city governance information management system correlation data statistical data set, combined with data and empirical analysis of blockchain in modernization. The role of urban governance information management system, combined with effective data, summarizes and analyzes the role of blockchain in modern city governance information management system. The results show that with the method of this paper, the recognition rate reaches 34%, which is faster and 20% faster than others.2. Specific Methods Are Suggested2.1. BlockchainA blockchain is a database with a function of \"hashing verification\" of data. Blocks are data blocks, which combine data blocks into a chain structure in chronological order and use cryptographic algorithms to collectively maintain the reliability of the database in the form of distributed accounting. All data blocks are connected in chronological order to form a blockchain.In the following aspects, the timestamp is superior to the general time recording function: first, the timestamp ensures the automatic and orderly connection of chronological blocks, rather than the idle arrangement in the database. Secondly, timestamp is an auxiliary tool for information query, which can save a lot of time. It is very convenient"
