"especially the young and middle-aged as the most important part of the tourism market, are no longer satisfied with the way of group travel but are inclined to \"self-service travel\". They hope to choose the travel destination they are most interested in according to their personal hobbies and interests, use their favorite means of transportation, and travel freely. Therefore, the personalization of tourism behavior has become the general trend of its development. However, the new propensity to consume creates an obvious contradiction. On the one hand, travel is already a behavior with a wide range of people, and many of them want to make their own travel plans without being constrained by group travel [1]. On the other hand, the formulation of a scientific tourism plan should at least reasonably organize the six elements of \"travel, food, accommodation, tourism, shopping and entertainment\" according to a certain theme. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate a good schedule to ensure that tourists can obtain the maximum travel experience in the shortest time and at the lowest economic cost. This includes tourism geography, tourism psychology, tourism aesthetics, tourism economics, tourism sociology, and other multidisciplinary knowledge. However, it is impossible for tourists to have professional knowledge in various disciplines involved in tourism, so they need professional help [2].The knowledge base of a tourism expert system is divided into dictionary base and"
"knowledge. However, it is impossible for tourists to have professional knowledge in various disciplines involved in tourism, so they need professional help [2].The knowledge base of a tourism expert system is divided into dictionary base and rule base. The dictionary base includes a noun base and a fact base. The noun base is used to store the keywords and codes describing the recommendation or analysis results of the tourism expert system, including the tourism resources of the tourism system, tourism service resources, and other proper nouns and their explanations [3]]. The fact base stores the parameters that tourists may choose to describe the various resource demands in the tourism system [4]. The rule base is used to store all the rules, including the rule precondition library and the rule conclusion library. The rule prewarehouse stores the preconditions corresponding to each conditional rule. According to the parameter values and possible results of tourists' actual demand for various tourism resources, the rule conclusion library is divided into rules from demand parameters to demand parameters and rules from demand parameters to conclusion [5]. In the intelligent tourism information system, the tourism expert system includes the tourism expert planning subsystem and the tourism expert recommendation subsystem. For each subsystem, an independent rule base is defined and an independent rule table is established [6].In the expert system, reasoning is based on the"
"system includes the tourism expert planning subsystem and the tourism expert recommendation subsystem. For each subsystem, an independent rule base is defined and an independent rule table is established [6].In the expert system, reasoning is based on the existing knowledge in the knowledge base, which is a kind of knowledge-based reasoning. A computer that implements knowledge-based reasoning constitutes an inference engine. As one of the cores of the expert system, the inference engine's main task is to timely determine the selection and application of knowledge in the process of problem solving. The control strategy of the inference engine determines the choice of knowledge, and the inference mode of the inference engine determines the application of specific knowledge [7]. The inference direction of the inference engine is used to determine the driving mode of inference, which is divided into forward inference, reverse inference and hybrid inference. No matter which direction of reasoning, the system generally requires a knowledge base for storing knowledge, a database for storing initial known facts and problem states, and an inference engine for reasoning [8].Forward reasoning is the reasoning from the fact to the goal, also known as fact-driven reverse reasoning. It does not start reasoning according to the input facts, and checks the reasoning rules in the knowledge base in turn. If the premise of the rule is true, the rule is employed, thereby generating new facts.,"
"also known as fact-driven reverse reasoning. It does not start reasoning according to the input facts, and checks the reasoning rules in the knowledge base in turn. If the premise of the rule is true, the rule is employed, thereby generating new facts., it is also possible that new rules are adopted, so that until all relevant rules in the knowledge base are detected, all possible results are obtained, and the inference result is a set of facts [9]. Forward reasoning is suitable for obtaining all possible outcomes from a limited set of facts. Reverse reasoning is the reasoning from goals to facts, also known as goal-driven. Reverse the reasoning process, formulate hypotheses, and use the knowledge in the knowledge base to judge whether the hypotheses are true or false. If it is true, record the knowledge used for explanation; if false, put forward a new hypothesis again, and then make a judgment; judge when the reasoning can be ended; and if necessary, ask the user about the situation [10]. Reverse reasoning does not need to consider rules unrelated to the overall goal, but the choice of goal is blind, and it is suitable for applying to the range of known problem solutions, and the number of solutions is small. The basic idea of the hybrid reasoning strategy is to first select the initial target through data-driven help, and then use the target to drive to solve the target; or first assume a target for reverse reasoning, and then use the information obtained in the reverse"
"of the hybrid reasoning strategy is to first select the initial target through data-driven help, and then use the target to drive to solve the target; or first assume a target for reverse reasoning, and then use the information obtained in the reverse reasoning to carry out forward reasoning to deduce more many conclusions. It avoids the blindness of target selection and overcomes the blindness of reasoning in data-driven [11]. The tourism expert system, including the tourism expert recommendation subsystem and the tourism expert planning subsystem, adopts different reasoning rules, respectively. The tourism expert recommendation subsystem adopts a mixed reasoning strategy. First, forward reasoning is carried out, starting from the initial conditions, and reasoning towards the final goal of the problem to be solved. If the premise of the rule is true, the rule is adopted until each initial condition finds the corresponding goal [12]. Since there may be logical relationships such as \"and\", \"or,\" and \"not\" between the initial conditions, the inference results may not be ideal. Then, these goals are used to drive the reverse inference, and the reasoning is repeated, and finally the tourists are satisfied with the conclusion. The tourism expert planning subsystem is driven by facts and adopts forward reasoning [13].Smart tourism service is one of the cores of smart tourism, emphasizing the use of smart technology to provide tourists with higher-quality services and improve their"
"tourism expert planning subsystem is driven by facts and adopts forward reasoning [13].Smart tourism service is one of the cores of smart tourism, emphasizing the use of smart technology to provide tourists with higher-quality services and improve their service levels. Generally speaking, before traveling, tourists will first search for the attractions they want to visit on the Internet, and then arrange the itinerary according to their own time after making a decision. At the same time, relevant staff of tourist attractions will collect and sort out travel records and travel information, and formulate targeted travel plans to attract the attention of tourists [14]. Tourism enterprises can design specific travel plans that meet the needs of tourists in advance through the online tourism system platform, provide tourists with multiple optional tourist attractions, and create humanized tourism services. Secondly, in the context of big data, the smart management model will update tourism information at any time, provide tourists with the latest tourism trends, provide more service space for the tourism industry, and promote the development of the tourism industry [15]. In the smart management model, tourism industry staff can comprehensively collect and organize tourists' booking status, identity information, and travel information to ensure the security of tourists' personal information, and establish travel information and travel platform websites across the country to"
"can comprehensively collect and organize tourists' booking status, identity information, and travel information to ensure the security of tourists' personal information, and establish travel information and travel platform websites across the country to realize travel information sharing. Finally, the smart tourism service platform based on big data is a powerful tool for the conversion of new and old kinetic energy, which helps tourism companies to achieve precise marketing, improve the quality of tourism services, and meet the personalized and differentiated needs of tourists [16]. At the same time, the development of tourism will often lead to the development of catering, accommodation, transportation and other service industries, thereby driving regional economic development. The smart tourism service based on big data improves the management level of the tourism management department, solves various new problems encountered in the development of the tourism industry more scientifically and quickly, and can effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of tourists. In addition, the smart tourism service platform has a public welfare nature, providing free tourism reference data for tourists and tourism enterprises, improving the quality of tourism public services and achieving high social benefits [17].Building a smart tourism management model is inseparable from perfect information equipment, but from the current point of view, smart tourism is still in the"
"improving the quality of tourism public services and achieving high social benefits [17].Building a smart tourism management model is inseparable from perfect information equipment, but from the current point of view, smart tourism is still in the early stage of development. Although the tourist attractions have solved the problem of weak signal of network tourism resources, they have not fully realized the full coverage of the radio tourism resources signal, which brings a lot of inconvenience to tourists. In terms of mobile platform construction, the level of tourism management informatization is low, and there are defects in data collection and information processing. Especially during holidays, the number of tourists is large, and the intelligent platforms of many scenic spots cannot intelligently process information, making it difficult to effectively evaluate the number of tourists, which will reduce the tourist experience of tourists [18].This paper combines the Internet of Things technology and 5G technology to carry out the intelligent development of tourism resources, so as to improve the recommendation effect of modern tourism resources and improve the effect of tourism development.2.

"Model2.1. Basic BuildingWe consider a total ofMomnidirectional array elements in the antenna array in space, and there areDtourist resource signal sources in the far field at the same time. First, there must be a calibration location. For the sake of convenience, this paper regards the position of the first sensor array element as the origin of the coordinates processed by the algorithm. After obtaining this coordinate origin, the expression for the arrival of thei-th tourist resource signal at the coordinate point is:(1)In Formula (1),zi(t) is thei-th tourism resource signal, andis the high-frequency carrier frequency that the tourism resource signal propagates in space. In the previous paper, it has been assumed that the tourism resource signal has the characteristics of narrowband, so there are:(2)Then, the tourism resource signal can be expressed as Formula (3) after the spatial propagation delay of timet.(3)Therefore, without considering any other errors, the spatial tourism resource signal source detected by them-th array element is in the form of:(4)In Formula (4),tmiis the relative time from thei-th sensor to them-th sensor relative to the calibrated origin array position. According to Formula (3) and Formula (4), the tourism resource signal received by the entire antenna sensor array can be written in the form shown in(5)In Formula (5), the direction vector of thei-th tourism resource signal is, the array manifold isA= [a0,a1, ⋯,aD−1], the tourism resource signal"

Array GeometryThe research in this paper is based on Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and Sparse Linear Array (SLA). Therefore, the following will give a detailed introduction to the two layout methods of uniform line array and sparse line array.2.2.1. Uniform Linear ArrayA schematic diagram of the layout of the uniform linear array is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs shown in Figure1,Marray elements with a distance of d are arranged on a straight line, and the position labels of the array elements start fromОand end atM− 1. An array of this type of arrangement is called a Uniform Linear Array (ULA). It positions the first array element at the origin of the coordinates.

"is called a Uniform Linear Array (ULA). It positions the first array element at the origin of the coordinates. When the angle between the incident angle of the target and the formation is 0, the time difference of the tourism resource signal on the nth sensor relative to the specified origin sensor is:(9)In the above formula,λrepresents the wavelength of the tourist resource signal. Substituting the Formula (9) into the direction vectora(θ), the specific expression of the steering vector of the linear uniform array can be obtained as shown in(10)In the formula,φ=ω0(2πd/λ)cosθFrom Formula (7), we get:(11)Formula (11) gives the specific representation of the array manifold of the equidistant linear array.It can be seen that the array flow pattern of ULA has a Vandermonde matrix structure, which allows many array tourism resource signal processing algorithms to process tourism resource signals received by a uniform linear array. The layout form of the uniform line array is simple, and it is also very beneficial to the realization of the project. In the following chapters, a post-processing flow based on Vandermonde matrix decomposition is used in the proposed grid-free DOA algorithm. The specific content will be discussed in detail in Chapter 3.2.3. Sparse Linear ArraysThere are many specific sparse forms of sparse linear arrays.

"in detail in Chapter 3.2.3. Sparse Linear ArraysThere are many specific sparse forms of sparse linear arrays. The sparse linear array introduced here is one of them, which can be regarded as a special uniform array. For a uniform linear array with M array elements, the wavelength of the tourist resource signal source incident on the sensor array is denoted byλ, and the distance between the two isd=λ/2. Then, the direction vectora(0) of thek-th tourism resource signal source has the following form:(12)In Formula (12),θ= −φ/2π. It can be seen thatθkis the frequency of the uniformly sampled complex sinusoida(θk). This is whyθis called the frequency parameter.A sparse linear array can be thought of as a uniform linear array with \"missing.\"The red array elements shown in Figure2indicate that there are no array elements originally placed at the position. It can be considered that the sparse linear array defined here is a linear array that only uses a subset of the array elements of the uniform linear array. This paper calls itΩ, therefore, the set of element position indicesΩ∈[M] of the SLA array. Without loss of generality, we assume that according to the increasing order ofΩ1= 1 andΩD=M, then the direction vector of thek-th source represented byaΩ(θk) under the SLA array is:(13)Open in figure viewerPowerPointWe denoteΓΩ(θk) ∈ {0, 1}D×Mas a selection matrix such that thej-th row ofΓΩcontains all 0 s, but a single 1 at theΓΩth position.

Obviously, there are:(14)2.4. Introduction to Subspace Class AlgorithmsThere are many methods for DOA estimation using multi-element arrays, among which the method based on eigendecomposition is a large category. This type of method uses the observed array data to construct a covariance matrix, then decomposes the covariance matrix, and then performs DOA estimation.The covariance matrixRobtained from the array data can be mathematically divided into tourist resource signal subspace and noise subspace, namely:(15)In Formula (15), [•]Hstrictly represents the transpose operation of the matrix. You can get:(16)According to Formula (16), we can get:(17)The rank of the matrix RSis full, and the matrix is a non-singular matrix, so its inverse must exist. Thus, Formula (17) can be transformed into the form of Formula (18):(18)Formula (18) shows that each column in the direction vector matrixA(O) is orthogonal to the noise subspace orthogonality decomposed by the mathematical dimension, so there are:(19)Due to the orthogonal relationship between the decomposed noise subspace and the tourist resource signal subspace, the spatial spectral function of the entire receiving antenna array can be derived in the form of Formula (20).(20)It can be known from Formula (20) thatθis"
"relationship between the decomposed noise subspace and the tourist resource signal subspace, the spatial spectral function of the entire receiving antenna array can be derived in the form of Formula (20).(20)It can be known from Formula (20) thatθis constantly changing in space, and the angle of arrival is estimated by searching for wave peaks. Then Formula (20) can be expressed as formula.(21)In the formula, the operation expression arg, min[·] represents the value corresponding toОwhen [·] obtains the minimum value, P is the projection matrix ofa(e), and its specific expression is:(22)According to the above reasoning, the steps of the MUSIC algorithm can be summarized as:(1)First, the estimation result of the covariance matrix is obtained from the direction vectors of theNsnapshot tourism resource signals received by the sensor array:(23)We eigendecompose the covariance matrix obtained by Formula (23):(24)(2)In this paper, all the eigenvalues are arranged in descending order, and the space formed byDlarge eigenvalues with the same number as the tourism resource signals is selected from the largest to the smallest, which is called the tourism resource signal subspace. Note that this operation is a division above the digit dimension. Next, the space formed by all the remaining (M-D) eigenvalues is called the noise subspace, and the covariance matrix can be rewritten as shown in Formula (25).(25)(3)In this paper, 0 is divided into grids in space, and the spectral peak"
"digit dimension. Next, the space formed by all the remaining (M-D) eigenvalues is called the noise subspace, and the covariance matrix can be rewritten as shown in Formula (25).(25)(3)In this paper, 0 is divided into grids in space, and the spectral peak function value of the spatial angle corresponding to each grid is calculated according to the spectral peak expression of Formula (20). The desired DOA estimate is the maximum value of the spectral peak function in the entire grid calculation result. If there are multiple signal sources, know the number of signal sources in advance, and sort the spectrum peaks from large to small. The value corresponding to the number of signal sources represents the required estimation result2.5. The Principle of ESPRIT AlgorithmThe computational cost of the ESPRIT algorithm is very low. The rotation-invariant subspace method has many excellent properties in the estimation of direction of arrival, and the ESPRIT algorithm has been widely used in recent years. Moreover, there have been many variants of algorithms, such as least squares ESPRIT algorithm, overall least squares criterion ESPRIT algorithm, singular value decomposition ESPRIT algorithm, and other variants of RSPRIT algorithm.It is assumed that two array elements with exactly the same properties are called an even array element, and the distance between the two array elements between an even array element is △. We assume an arbitrarily arranged planar array withMarray element"
"is assumed that two array elements with exactly the same properties are called an even array element, and the distance between the two array elements between an even array element is △. We assume an arbitrarily arranged planar array withMarray element pairs. That is, the array actually has 2Marray elements, but two array elements form an array element called an even array element. We assume that there are spatial tourism resource signal sources less than the number of even array elements that propagate in space at the same time and are captured by the array, then different tourism resource signal sources can be distinguished by DOA estimation. We assume that the noise is independent white Gaussian noise with varianceσ2. With the above assumptions, an array can be called as two arraysZxandZywhose translations are bothΔ. The output tourism resource signal on thei-th array element pair can be expressed as:(26)Among them,sk(t) is thek-th signal source received by the subarray Z, andθkis the arrival direction of thek-th tourism resource signal.ai(θk) is the array element response of thei-th array element to thek-th array element. c is the speed of light,nxi(t) andnyi(t) are Gaussian white noise on the subarraysZxandZy, respectively. The specific expression of the tourism resource signal output by each antenna radiating element of any subarray at time 1 is as follows:(27)(28)In Formula (27) and Formula (28), a and A are called direction vector and direction matrix, and the"
"The specific expression of the tourism resource signal output by each antenna radiating element of any subarray at time 1 is as follows:(27)(28)In Formula (27) and Formula (28), a and A are called direction vector and direction matrix, and the specific values areandA= [a(θ1),a(θ2), ⋯,a(θM)], respectively.Φis a K × K-dimensional diagonal matrix, and its diagonal elements represent the phase delay of each tourism resource signal source on each radiation unit, which is expressed as:Among them,μk= (ω0Δsinθk)/(c,k= 1, 2, ⋯,K), the matrixΦis the operator that connects the two arrays corresponding to an even array element. That is, (30) means that any one of the two subarrays corresponding to the even array element receives the tourism resource signal multiplied by the operatorΦto get the other array to receive the tourism resource signal. The travel resource signal of the entire array consists of two arrays together. Therefore, the output tourism resource signal matrix of the entire array is:(29)In Formula (29), there are:(30)A matrix with a dimension of 2M×Ncan be formed by using snapshot data of consecutiveNmoments, and Formula (29) can be matrixed. Therefore, it can be re-expressed in the form of(31)In Formula (31),Z= [z(t1),z(t2), ⋯,z(tN)],S= [s(t1),s(t2), ⋯,s(tN)],Nz= [nz(t1),nz(t2), ⋯,nz(tN)].

In the mathematical dimension, the signal subspace and noise subspace of tourism resources can be extracted from the data. First, the autocorrelation matrix of the output matrixZof the array data can be obtained as:(32)In the formula,Rzzrepresents the autocorrelation matrix of the tourism resource signal, and the variance of the noise is represented byσ2. The rank of the autocorrelation is full, and the dimension of its rank is the number of tourist resource signal sources. Of course, this conclusion must be obtained when the source of tourism resources is incoherent. If it is a coherent tourism resource signal, the two subspaces cannot be distinguished in the mathematical dimension, which will reduce the rank. At the same time, because the arrival angle of each tourism resource signal is different, there is no relationship between the columns of. The autocorrelation matrixRzzeigendecomposition is:(33)In Formula (33), the eigenvalues are arranged in descending order. Then, according to the number of tourist resource signal sources, the corresponding eigenvectorEs= [e1, ⋯,eK] is drawn into the tourist resource signal space and the eigenvectorEN= [eK+1, ⋯,e2M] into the noise space orthogonal to the tourist resource signal subspace.

From the analysis, it can be concluded that Ex and EY form similar subspaces, and the value on the main diagonal of matrixΦis the eigenvalue of matrixψ.According to the above analysis, the steps of DOA estimation by the LS-ESPRIT algorithm based on the correlation matrix can be summarized as follows:(1)The algorithm obtains the tourism resource signal matrixZfrom the array and obtains the estimationRzzof the correlation matrixRzz(2)The algorithm performs eigendecomposition onRzz, of which(3)The algorithm estimates the numberKof tourism resource signals(4)The algorithm takes the tourism resource signal subspace of the two subarrays corresponding to the eigenvalues of the corresponding number of Zhang Chengeven array elements(5)The algorithm calculates the eigenvalue of(6)The algorithm calculates to reach the estimated value of the angleθk= arcsin{c·angle(λk)/(ω0Δ)}3.

Intelligent Development of Tourism Resources Based on Internet of Things and 5G TechnologyTourist resources have the characteristics of various types, large quantities, wide distribution, diverse geographical combinations, and flexible and changeable market supply and demand. Therefore, in the process of investigation, evaluation, development, planning, dynamic monitoring, and protection of tourism resources as the basis of tourism development, it is necessary to improve the effect of intelligent development of tourism resources through intelligent methods.

"AbstractUniversal access to sexual and reproductive health remains part of the unfinished business of global development in Africa. To achieve it, health interventions should be monitored using programmatic indicators. WHO's Strengthening Measurement of Reproductive Health Indicators in Africa initiative, implemented in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, aimed to improve national information systems for routine monitoring of reproductive health indicators. Participating countries developed action plans employing a two-pronged strategy: (1) revising, standardizing, and harmonizing existing reproductive health indicators captured through routine information-systems; and (2) building data-collection capacity through training and supervision at select pilot sites. Country teams evaluated existing and new indicators, and outlined barriers to strengthening routine measurement. Activities included updating abortion-care guidelines (spontaneous and induced abortions), providing training on laws surrounding induced abortions, and improving feedback mechanisms. The country teams updated monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and attempted to build recording/reporting capacity in selected pilot areas. Barriers to implementing the initiative that were encountered included restrictive induced-abortion laws, staff turn-over, and administrative delays, including low capacity among healthcare staff and competing priorities for staff time. The areas identified for further improvement"
"initiative that were encountered included restrictive induced-abortion laws, staff turn-over, and administrative delays, including low capacity among healthcare staff and competing priorities for staff time. The areas identified for further improvement were up-scaling programs to a national level, creating scorecards to record data, increasing collaborations with the private sector, conducting related costing exercises, and performing ex-post evaluations.1 IntroductionGlobally, progress towards improving maternal health, especially universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, has been slow and uneven.1Reaching universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare remains a key factor in achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, \"[to] ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\", and, particularly goal 3.7 of ensuring, by 2030, \"universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes\".2To reduce maternal mortality rates and improve maternal health, women must have access to high-impact interventions and quality reproductive services. Health-service interventions with the aim of reducing unmet need, preventing unsafe abortion, and managing complications due to abortion, contribute towards meeting these targets, particularly universal access to reproductive healthcare.

"interventions with the aim of reducing unmet need, preventing unsafe abortion, and managing complications due to abortion, contribute towards meeting these targets, particularly universal access to reproductive healthcare. However, to ensure these goals are met, interventions--established and implemented at a national level--should also be monitored and strengthened through the use of programmatic indicators. Global, regional, and national monitoring of carefully selected programmatic indicators would help in detecting periodic changes, identifying gaps to achieving goals, and directing actions toward achieving success.Maternal mortality (and its causes) and unmet contraception needs were among the key monitoring indicators for assessing progress in achieving Millennium Development Goal 5, improving maternal health. Global and national monitoring can help detect changes in these indicators, aiding understanding of progress toward Millennium Development Goal 5 and its two targets: (1) reducing maternal mortality, and (2) achieving universal access to reproductive health (Figure1).3For almost all indicators, the slowest progress rates have been in African countries.1Despite the continent having experienced a notable decrease in unmet family-planning needs (−1.9% between 2000 and 2015, second only to −2.0% in Latin America and Caribbean regions),424% of women in Africa remain without access to family planning; this is the highest percentage worldwide.4Figure 1Open in figure"

Unmet family-planning need was calculated as the percentage of women aged 15-49 years who were married or in unions who wished to delay childbearing but were not using contraception.In 2007, to assist countries in this endeavor, WHO and the United Nations Population Fund developed a guide for national-level monitoring of progress toward universal access to reproductive health.5The guide provided a framework (hereafter referred to as the 2007 framework) to monitor progress toward universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, consisting of a set of indicators supporting the collection of reproductive healthcare data. The 17 indicators presented in the 2007 framework underwent a rigorous consultation process with the goal of ensuring they addressed the main aspects of sexual and reproductive healthcare and could be used to monitor progress in terms of removing barriers, improving health systems, and positively addressing needs and risks within this area.5Additionally, the 2007 framework was intended to help guide decision-making to identify and implement activities that could accelerate progress toward universal access to reproductive healthcare.This"

Each country developed an action plan to strengthen information systems through the inclusion of selected reproductive health indicators (regarding family planning and safe abortion) to better monitor actions taken to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal and reproductive health.Technical teams from the Ministry of Health in each study country and WHO developed plans to strengthen national information systems by: (1) revising existing reproductive health indicators, (2) incorporating new family-planning and safe abortion care indicators, including post-abortion contraceptive use by method,"
"and WHO developed plans to strengthen national information systems by: (1) revising existing reproductive health indicators, (2) incorporating new family-planning and safe abortion care indicators, including post-abortion contraceptive use by method, (3) piloting both revised and new indicators at a sub-national level (through training and supervision), and (4) strengthening feedback mechanisms at both the sub-national and facility level.Each country's plan outlined context-specific activities that supported the two main aims of the initiative: to strengthen reproductive health indicators (their definition, collection, and monitoring) and to ensure that efforts yielded improved information for decision making.3 Program PlanningIn November 2012, a multi-country workshop was convened in Nairobi, Kenya, to introduce the reproductive health-program monitoring indicators (based the 2007 framework) related to family planning and safe abortion.8Country teams were comprised of Ministry of Health program officers, monitoring and evaluation officers, and WHO reproductive health technical staff (from both country offices and headquarters). During the meeting, participants received an overview of program implementation, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and reproductive health indicators--including their characteristics, data sources, quality, and analysis (both quantitative and qualitative).The countries present at the workshop were Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,"
"evaluation frameworks, and reproductive health indicators--including their characteristics, data sources, quality, and analysis (both quantitative and qualitative).The countries present at the workshop were Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Based on the aforementioned discussions, countries conducted systematic evaluations of the status of existing reproductive health indicators (AppendixS1). This assessment was based on data sources, data quality, and strategies for improvement. At the same workshop, countries also identified and prioritized new indicators (drawn from the 2007 framework) that were based on data sources, feasibility, and requirements for routine reporting. Additionally, the country teams outlined barriers to strengthening the routine measurement of those indicators deemed to be high priority during the evaluation process.All country teams present at the workshop were invited to submit a concept note and five countries were selected to submit full proposals for the initiative (implemented between August 2013 and December 2015). These countries were Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Across these five countries, the main objective of the proposals was to apply country-specific strategies aimed at improving the monitoring of reproductive health services and related indicators.

"proposals was to apply country-specific strategies aimed at improving the monitoring of reproductive health services and related indicators. Once the proposals were finalized and approved, the country teams conducted activities and prepared programmatic updates approximately every 6 months using a standardized reporting form (AppendixS2). A mid-point review meeting was held in Kampala, Uganda, in September 2014, where countries were able to present and share learning experiences from their strategies, update work plans, and to prepare for the final implementation phase.Finally, in December 2015, WHO held a meeting in Accra, Ghana, to finalize and disseminate the results of the project. Of the original 10 countries invited to participate in Kenya in 2012, nine were present at the final meeting (Tanzania was absent). Countries that had implemented initiatives shared results and insights, whereas those that had not, shared their ongoing work and progress regarding reproductive health indicators.4 ResultsBased on the activities at the Kenya workshop in 2012, country teams prepared proposals that prioritized indicators and identified data sources. The majority of the core indicators prioritized, such as unmet need for family planning, adolescent birth rate, total fertility rate, and contraceptive use, were already collected as part of Demographic Health Surveys, and countries relied on these surveys to measure these indicators.

"adolescent birth rate, total fertility rate, and contraceptive use, were already collected as part of Demographic Health Surveys, and countries relied on these surveys to measure these indicators. The prioritized indicators that were not collected as part of Demographic and Health Surveys were identified (Table1), and country teams identified major barriers to tracking these indicators. These barriers were grouped under the three main areas: (1) policy, national standards, leadership (including financial costs), and inadequate commitment to monitoring and evaluation activities at the sub-national level; (2) weaknesses in data collection and information systems, including inadequate distribution logistics for data collection tools, a lack of systematic feedback mechanisms, low data quality, and weak linkages among data sources; and (3) issues related to health workers, including excessive staff reporting obligations, inadequate staff numbers, and high staff turn-over.Table 1.Indicators identified for prioritization in country proposalsCountryIndicatorGhanaNumber of family planning service delivery points per 500 000 populationNumber of other sources of family planning information, services, and supplies per 500 000 populationProportion of induced abortions managed using medication (e.g. using mifepristone/misoprostol) and not surgeryHealth providers trained to provide safe induced-abortion services within the full extent of the lawKenyaNumber of primary health facilities"

Based on systematic evaluations conducted in each country, a single conceptual framework was developed for strengthening the measurement of reproductive health indicators. This framework was then adapted by the country teams from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, and the individual frameworks were included in the country proposals (Figure2).Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointConceptual framework for strengthening the measurement of reproductive health indicators. Abbreviations: DHS, demographic health survey; HMIS, health management information system.To overcome the barriers identified above, the following approaches were systematically included in the proposals: (1) country consultations were performed to build consensus among key stakeholders; (2) high- and low-performing pilot districts (based on their performance according to existing reproductive-health indicators) were selected to use revised data-management tools prior to up-scaling; and (3) monthly/quarterly statistical bulletins on reproductive health indicators were prepared to facilitate the implementation of feedback mechanisms.

"data-management tools prior to up-scaling; and (3) monthly/quarterly statistical bulletins on reproductive health indicators were prepared to facilitate the implementation of feedback mechanisms. Each county team tailored the implementation of these approaches in line with their own experience, and the programs derived from the workshop are summarized below.4.1 GhanaAt the district level, new tools were developed to map the number of facilities providing reproductive-health services and to capture monthly reproductive health information summaries. The Ghana team also created new facility-level data ledgers with the intention of ensuring tools existed for capturing comprehensive abortion care data, as well as clarifying definitions for reproductive healthcare indicators. These updated data ledgers included a section (or column) for healthcare providers to record patients' most common sources of reproductive health information. This information was considered important to the efforts of the Ministry of Health in terms of identifying the most popular means of disseminating and harnessing reproductive health messages them. This program was piloted in the Akuapim North and Atiwa Districts in the Eastern region, and Sagnarigu, East Mamprusi, and West Mamprusi in the Northern region.

In these districts, the country team provided intensive training on the use of the new data ledgers and tools to healthcare workers before a pilot phase began at facilities in these five districts; the country team conducted joint-supervision visits every 3 months. At the time of writing, the Ghana team was in the process of planning the national dissemination of the district-level and updated comprehensive abortion care tools.4.2 KenyaOwing to high staff turnover in 2013, the Kenya team faced many administrative obstacles in project implementation (including administrative changes at the province, district, county, and sub-county levels), causing significant delays. Despite these factors, the Kenyan team, in conjunction with partners (national and international non-governmental organizations working in the health sector), updated reproductive health indicators, including the provision of training on the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) for maternal deaths and cervical cancer. A national monitoring and evaluation framework was finalized, and the Kenyan team worked with partners and stakeholders (including relevant funding agencies and professional associations) to adapt safe induced-abortion care guidelines. Further, the team implemented a pilot program in the Kakamega and Kiambu districts to introduce new, and updated existing indicators from the finalized framework. Results from this pilot"

Further, the team implemented a pilot program in the Kakamega and Kiambu districts to introduce new, and updated existing indicators from the finalized framework. Results from this pilot will be used to inform a national revision of reproductive health indicators.4.3 NigeriaAs part of the initiative described in the present manuscript, the Nigerian team revised sexual and reproductive health indicators, updated existing data collection tools, and worked to support the coordination mechanisms of the Nigerian health management information system. At the start of this initiative, Nigeria had a national mobile electronic database for collecting data at the sub-national level and at some healthcare facilities (mostly large hospital facilities, as clinics generally employed paper-based systems). The team and its implementing partners, including UNFPA, FHI 360, and USAID MEASURE Evaluation, held a stakeholder forum to revise the national health management information system tools, with a focus on reproductive health and induced abortion indicators. The updated tools were then presented to the national health management information systems technical working group for validation. The Nigerian team then piloted the updated tools and indicators in two states (Ekiti and the Federal Capital Territory); further, the team trained 45 healthcare providers and monitoring-and-evaluation officers to use the tools and indicators.

"The Nigerian team then piloted the updated tools and indicators in two states (Ekiti and the Federal Capital Territory); further, the team trained 45 healthcare providers and monitoring-and-evaluation officers to use the tools and indicators. The Nigerian team went on to conduct six mentoring visits. The pilot training resulted in increased capacity at the state level, demonstrated by improvements in the completeness and timeliness of data reporting. This was measured by the percentage of health facilities in both states involved in the pilot that provided routine data reports (including data on reproductive health and induced abortion indicators) to the national health management information system on a quarterly basis. In Ekiti State, health-facility data reporting rates increased from 18% (July-September 2013) to 67% (July-September 2014), and in the Federal Capitol Territory, rates increased from 41% (July-September 2013) to 60% (July-September 2014). As part of the project activities, the Nigerian team produced and printed 1000 copies of a quarterly reproductive-health statistics bulletin, containing updates on relevant reproductive health indicators, for distribution at national and state levels (usually within the health system but also shared with implementing partners and donors, if appropriate). At the time of writing, the Nigerian Ministry of Health was planning to scale-up the pilot program to other states and to decentralize evidence-based decision making"
"the health system but also shared with implementing partners and donors, if appropriate). At the time of writing, the Nigerian Ministry of Health was planning to scale-up the pilot program to other states and to decentralize evidence-based decision making strategies, with the aim of increasing the use of reproductive health data (presented in bulletins and within national health management information systems) at state level. These efforts also focused on improving the quality of data by reviewing the data collected and recorded in the national database. Further, the Nigerian team began to prepare and distribute a semi-annual bulletin (based on the quarterly bulletin produced for this project, but at the national level) with the aim of strengthening feedback at the sub-national level by providing state-level staff access to summarized information collected at the national level.4.4 UgandaWithin Uganda, there was a supportive family-planning policy environment that was reinforced by the Uganda Vision 2040 program (a national government-led consultation, launched in 2013 with the goal of, \"A Transformed Ugandan Society from Peasant to Modern and Prosperous Country within 30 years\"9) and an ongoing national review of reproductive health care.

"health care. The Ugandan team attempted to develop consensus across 15 core comprehensive abortion care indicators (including family planning counseling of mothers during prenatal care, with a particular focus on women with HIV), as well as working with partners from the Center for Health and Human Rights and Development to clarify the legal boundaries surrounding induced-abortion care for the protection of healthcare workers, and to ensure the implementation of new abortion guidelines. Several national stakeholder consultations were performed and included all parties involved in the delivery of health care (professional associations, implementing partners, and donors). The Ugandan team led the consultative process (based on discussions and review of existing indicators) that resulted in the standardization of comprehensive care indicators for patients undergoing induced-abortions and of the 15 indicators to be applied systematically, across all healthcare facilities. Additionally, the Ugandan Ministry of Health recruited legislators to act as champions to improve the policy environment for sustaining comprehensive induced-abortion care services at lower-level health facilities. As part of this initiative, the Ugandan team held a national stakeholders meeting to share up-to-date information on women's lack of access to comprehensive reproductive health services including family planning and safe abortion services, and its impact on maternal mortality and morbidity.

"team held a national stakeholders meeting to share up-to-date information on women's lack of access to comprehensive reproductive health services including family planning and safe abortion services, and its impact on maternal mortality and morbidity. The Ugandan team also reviewed existing sexual and reproductive healthcare data collection tools and indicators, and finalized a comprehensive monitoring-and-evaluation framework for a national sexual and reproductive health program. The indicators were piloted in two districts (Hoima and Iganga) and feedback from healthcare professionals who attended the training demonstrated that collecting data for the new indicators was feasible. Furthermore, as a result of this initiative and in co-operation with other national initiatives (Uganda Vision 2040), a costed implementation plan was developed for the national reproductive health program 2015-2020; this plan incorporated performance monitoring of the costed implementation plan, with the goal of establishing a multi-sectorial approach to monitoring said program.4.5 ZimbabwePrior to the initiative described in the present manuscript, Zimbabwe had a national integrated data-collection system. It included data-collection using death-notification forms (completed within 7 days of a maternal death), and sexual and reproductive healthcare data sheets and registers (employed at the facility level; data sheets were used to report aggregated information on a monthly basis and registers"
"forms (completed within 7 days of a maternal death), and sexual and reproductive healthcare data sheets and registers (employed at the facility level; data sheets were used to report aggregated information on a monthly basis and registers were used to capture individual patient information). The Zimbabwe team hired a new management and evaluation officer as part of this initiative and conducted a rapid situational analysis to identify weaknesses and strengths in existing data collection systems (including the use of the aforementioned tools), as well as to monitor and evaluate reproductive health indicators. Based on this analysis, the team updated both maternal mortality audit and facility-level sexual and reproductive health data sheets. The Zimbabwe team conducted a pilot program with these updated tools in Mashonaland East, Masvingo, and Matabeleland North provinces. During this pilot, the Zimbabwe team also collected qualitative feedback from health workers in these provinces and, based on the results, produced an updated and finalized national sexual and reproductive health monitoring and evaluation framework that included key indicators. Relevant individuals (in addition to the team members), specifically from the National, Provincial and District Health Information Offices were involved in the planning for this initiative, with the aim of standardizing reproductive health indicators and incorporating revised data-collection tools into existing health management"
"National, Provincial and District Health Information Offices were involved in the planning for this initiative, with the aim of standardizing reproductive health indicators and incorporating revised data-collection tools into existing health management systems. Additionally, the Zimbabwe team were able to include the reproductive health indicators in the existing national quarterly publication, \"Health Matters\". At the time of writing, the Ministry of Health was working to disseminate the monitoring and evaluation framework to all stakeholders nationally and was working to convene a national meeting to establish the indicators across all Zimbabwe.5 DiscussionThe five countries that participated in the present initiative revised and updated national sexual and reproductive healthcare-related indicators, and monitoring and evaluation plans, with a specific focus on family planning and safe induced-abortion services. Each country team tailored their implementation plans following the initial analysis and discussions. Country teams reported that effective collaboration with relevant stakeholders was important throughout the implementation phase. Pilot programs were implemented in at least two sub-national areas in each of the five countries to investigate the application of updated data-collection tools; alongside this, sub-national and facility-level healthcare workers received training in implementing the data-collection tools.The work described in the present manuscript"

This declaration sought to recommend strategies for improving the provision of primary health services across nine priority areas, including health information systems.11Similarly, the mid-project meeting of the present initiative, in September 2014, served as a platform for the five teams to share their experiences and learn from one another. The country teams stressed the importance of capacity building; universally, the teams reported that when delivering initial or refresher training on existing and new indicators to healthcare staff, the level of knowledge and skill among trainees varied across different facilities. Country teams reported that, in some instances, healthcare workers were unclear on the variables measured for existing indicators.

Further, high staff-turnover rates and shortages in human resources at sub-national facilities could present significant problems for the implementation of new indicators.Some general problems across the participating countries were also illuminated during the project; one such concern was to ensure healthcare workers had a clear understanding of the country's laws surrounding induced abortions and acted within them, producing an environment conducive to implementing new guidelines. The country teams reported that legal barriers resulted in delays in adapting safe induced-abortion care guidelines and in incorporating related indicators into everyday practice.During the implementation phase, country teams highlighted the harmonization of data-collection tools as a priority. This harmonization was reported as being important, not only nationally, but also across partner organizations to ensure that data collected at the facility level were then included in higher level databases. Efforts to synchronize data collection were necessary to avoid overlap and superfluous collection, trends that can occasionally be propagated by donors and other stakeholders.12Population-based surveys (such as the Demographic Health Surveys) are important but they should not be used as the sole source for core"
"avoid overlap and superfluous collection, trends that can occasionally be propagated by donors and other stakeholders.12Population-based surveys (such as the Demographic Health Surveys) are important but they should not be used as the sole source for core reproductive health indicators. During the implementation phase of the present initiative, the feasibility of using routine health information systems to track indicators and progress toward targets was highlighted. The development of more robust feedback loops is also crucial for improving data collection, accountability, and support to staff in the implementation of monitoring and evaluation activities to improve service provision. This could be initiated through the implementation of a bulletin, as was reported by some country teams in the present initiative, and/or the inclusion of indicators in the Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescent Health scorecard,13which is currently produced quarterly in a number of countries in the African region.In the present initiative, effective co-ordination between country teams and other stakeholders through consensus-building meetings was important to avoid what has been described by AbouZahr and Boerma14as the development of separate, parallel mechanisms responding to a donor's requirements and not the needs of a country itself.

"of separate, parallel mechanisms responding to a donor's requirements and not the needs of a country itself. As part of the present initiative, workshops and follow-up consultations were convened that included country teams, representatives from a country's Ministry of Health, relevant partner organizations in the country, and academic institutions, to discuss the relevance of indicators to a country's needs; this enabled the prioritization of indicators based on national, rather than international, requirements. Additionally, it was hypothesized that collaborating with national stakeholders to tailor the initiative to the local context and other ongoing reproductive healthcare initiatives would support stronger, more sustainable outputs compared with what could have been achieved individually.During the course of the initiative, some limitations were encountered. Although participating countries used a two-pronged approach in implementing the project (working at the national level to build consensus, and at the sub-national level to implement changes), it was difficult to draw comparisons across the five countries. Each participating country had its own priorities and activities that were dependent upon national political conditions (particularly in terms of policies surrounding induced abortion), and interventions during the implementation phase varied depending on national-level circumstances. Additionally, high staff turnover, particularly in monitoring and evaluation"
"conditions (particularly in terms of policies surrounding induced abortion), and interventions during the implementation phase varied depending on national-level circumstances. Additionally, high staff turnover, particularly in monitoring and evaluation positions (owing to personal reasons or, elections within higher-levels of government) made it difficult to sustain field activities. During the initiative, elections in Kenya resulted in delays to activities of longer than 6 months and high staff turnover in Ghana resulted in training at sub-national facilities having to be repeated. Finally, another limitation was a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of indicators themselves; although the initiative aimed to improve data collection and use, country teams did not track changes in specific healthcare measures such as contraceptive-use rates.The conceptual framework developed (Figure2) provided a standard approach to measuring the outcomes of reproductive health programs in Africa. Effective implementation was facilitated by basing projects on a common protocol with a clear conceptual framework that allowed countries to tailor programs to specific settings. In terms of future steps, it was intended that country teams could: (1) scale up the intervention nationally; (2) conduct a national family-planning costing exercise (including a monitoring and evaluation plan); (3) complete an ex-post evaluation to ensure indicators are implemented; and (4) build sub national-level"
"(1) scale up the intervention nationally; (2) conduct a national family-planning costing exercise (including a monitoring and evaluation plan); (3) complete an ex-post evaluation to ensure indicators are implemented; and (4) build sub national-level capacity to ensure the generation of local reports and the use of data.The need for robust health information systems is highlighted by the momentum and political will surrounding the sustainable development goals.7Specifically, there is a need to strengthen existing national health information systems to routinely collect complete and accurate data to enable the timely implementation of decisions, particularly in terms of induced-abortion and family planning services in Sub-Saharan Africa, where demand for limiting births is increasing.15The collection and monitoring of data and indicators at the local, national, and global level would also present the necessary tools for increasing accountability. A two-pronged strategy to standardize reproductive health indicators, including stakeholder support at the national level, and increased data-collection capacity and supervision at the sub-national level, could strengthen the routine gathering of information on family planning and safe induced-abortion services.Author ContributionsMB, ÖT, and LS guided the conception, design, and implementation of the project, and prepared the manuscript.

"AbstractHuman resources are the most dynamic factor among all productivity factors. The goal of human resource management is to achieve effective and optimal allocation of resources, while the goal of optimal allocation is to promote the realization of corporate goals. At present, the overall domestic human resource management is relatively backward, and most of it is nonstandardized management, and the level of informatization and technology is not high. Therefore, this paper proposes the image model and algorithm research of human resource optimization configuration based on FPGA and microsystem analysis. First, through the data analysis method, in-depth study of traditional resource allocation algorithms: genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm, combined with machine learning algorithms, established a human resource optimization configuration model based on FPGA and microsystem analysis, and then optimized the configuration of human resources for the impact The standard deviation and variance measurement of 18 factors of the company, as well as the analysis of the matching degree between employees and positions, and required capabilities. Finally, it is concluded that the sample average is higher and the top three are employees' positive spirit A12, employees' executive ability A15, and the relationship between salary and performance A11.

"the top three are employees' positive spirit A12, employees' executive ability A15, and the relationship between salary and performance A11. The sample averages are 4.615, 4.522, and 4.479, respectively; standard deviation of the three factors with the smallest values are good values A8, strong employee cooperation ability A17, and perfect reward and punishment system A16. This shows that the above considerations should be considered in the optimization of enterprise human resources. Moreover, the algorithm in this paper is easier to obtain the optimal solution, and it is easier to obtain the optimal allocation result of human resources.1. IntroductionAny organization is a system. When assigning personnel to positions, they cannot be randomly assigned, and the best personnel in other positions cannot be assigned to positions that are not suitable for the staff. Therefore, they have certain methods and skills in the management of human resource allocation, especially since it is to meet the optimal characteristics of the system as a whole. In the process of two-way matching between employees and positions, it is necessary to screen and select and consider the required skills, knowledge, and experience. It is often difficult to achieve such a state in the daily human resource management process and lack of scientific and effective methods.

Therefore, this article proposes the image model and algorithm research of human resource optimization configuration based on FPGA and microsystem analysis to better solve the human resource configuration. The above problems meet the needs of actual daily work.FPGA is the same potential gateway. It is a kind of computer chip. The advantage is that you can adjust it permanently and it takes some time. When implementing this material, it is important to redistribute resources, such as new systems concepts, to promote innovation and improve human resource management systems. On this basis, in combination with a small-scale system analysis, the power analysis is performed simultaneously with the quantitative analysis, to promote the final optimization of human resources. This paper analyzes the image model and algorithm of human resource optimization configuration based on FPGA and the microsystem and realizes the optimal model configuration of FPGA and the microsystem by comparing the original basic human resource management system.The Jaafar MA Human Resource Information System (HRIS) is a joint product.

The purpose of our study is that this is Lebanon's first attempt to address the current state of Lebanon's human information system, to examine human resource management across all sectors, and to explore the use of universities as an example [1]. Wright et al. combines the knowledge and results of low-level behavior management/human resource management with an overview of the company's macroresources [2]. The Zhang J Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has become well-known for designing and designing advanced technology properties due to its design, low design cost, and high capacity. Current IP security solutions are often limited to FPGA configuration protection and require permanent FPGA key storage. In addition, they can not provide pay-per-view solutions for a reliable device. In this regard, he proposed a new IP security device to restrict IP functionality to specific FPGA devices, thus effectively protecting IP from cloning, copying, or using unauthorized integration. The human resource information system has played a great role in solving the problem of resource allocation and is suitable for major resources, optimizing the management of the group company [3].The innovations of this article are as follows: (1) analyze complete research data by combining power analysis with quantitative analysis and (2) integrating scientific research"
"for major resources, optimizing the management of the group company [3].The innovations of this article are as follows: (1) analyze complete research data by combining power analysis with quantitative analysis and (2) integrating scientific research with homicide research and integrating human resource-based sample analysis into systematic analysis. The relationship between weight ratio, management requirements, and manual work difficulty and time is proposed, and it is combined with quantitative research, blog system, and practical research. On the genetic algorithm, most solutions to the general redundancy assignment problem assume that the redundancy strategy of each subsystem is predetermined and fixed; however, in practice, both active redundancy and cold standby redundancy can be used in the system design, and the choice of redundant strategy becomes an additional decision variable. But genetic algorithm can solve this kind of problem very well. In order to improve the convergence and diversity of Pareto optimal sets in the multiobjective optimization algorithm, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm (d MOPSO-DE) based on decomposition and differential evolution is proposed, in which the direction angle is used to generate a set ofAdirection vector that keeps the population uniformly distributed.

Genetic AlgorithmGenetic algorithms are based on the laws of biological evolution, that is, the survival of the fittest and the survival of the fittest. The programming and implementation of the genetic algorithm is relatively complex. First, the problem needs to be encoded, and after the optimal solution is found, the problem needs to be decoded. It was first proposed in 1975 by Professor J. Holland. Its main function is to handle construction objects directly. There is no fixed limit on output and operation.

Is its application for artificial intelligence machine learning? It is very broad; like signal processing and other fields, it has been revised in the text, as follows, genetic algorithms are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning and are widely used, such as signal processing in other fields [5].2.1.1. The Steps and Significance of Genetic Algorithm(1)First select the group. Alternatively, select the characters or groups ofi= 1, 2, ⋯n. The first group solves many problems. Generally,η= 30-160. It is often a random group or symboli= 1, 2, ⋯n. The best solution to this problem is to develop these key issues [6](2)Select individuals based on the principle of their optimal survival. Here, define the functionf. How do you represent each person?f(as) is called the suitability of the individual(1)2.1.2. Features of Genetic Algorithm(1)The biggest difference between genetic algorithms and traditional algorithms lies in their different starting points [7,8]. General algorithms calculate from a single initial value to obtain a local optimal solution, but genetic algorithms can calculate from the overall situation to find the overall optimal solution. Excellent solution, the coverage of this solution is still relatively large [9](2)The genetic algorithm hardly uses the information of a specific problem and can simply constitute a"
"from the overall situation to find the overall optimal solution. Excellent solution, the coverage of this solution is still relatively large [9](2)The genetic algorithm hardly uses the information of a specific problem and can simply constitute a general algorithm program. Genetic algorithms use matching value information for retrieval, so there is no need for information directly related to the function of the problem [10](3)By selecting, crossing, and modifying, you can quickly delete completely different fibers in the best solution. Therefore, genetic algorithms have high resistance to inhibitors [11](4)The selection, crossing, and modification of the genetic algorithm are all random tasks and not specific rules. This shows the genetic algorithm for finding the best solution and selecting the best solution using a random method, where the intersection represents the vision of the best solution and the contrast indicates the range of the solution, the best in the world [12]2.2. Particle Swarm Optimization AlgorithmThis combination is a group-based evolutionary algorithm, which simulates the actions of a flock of birds flying in pursuit of food, and achieves the best combination through collective cooperation between the flocks.

"flocks. PSO has the advantages of algorithm simplicity, simple implementation, fast convergence, and no need to adjust multiple parameters [13,14]. According to the characteristics of the mathematical model of optimal manpower allocation, the independence of genetic algorithm is adopted in the particle swarm optimization algorithm [15]. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used in neural network training, classifier design, cluster analysis, and network community discovery, and a detailed code design is given.In a large area, the birds did not know where there is food. How did they find the food they need in the shortest time? This requires solving the distance optimization problem. First, PSO names the position of each bird in the sky as a particle, and there is a common function between them, which is an optimization function. According to this optimization function, each bird has a certain flight direction and distance and speed. Then, all the particles will be searched according to the best particles around them until the optimal solution is found through repeated iterations. This solution is called each extremumpbest. All independent particles update their position and velocity according to the following formula [16]:(2)(3)The iteration termination condition usually selects the maximum number of repetitions or the minimum standard error of the particle combination according to the specific problem.

"[16]:(2)(3)The iteration termination condition usually selects the maximum number of repetitions or the minimum standard error of the particle combination according to the specific problem. The initial position and velocity of the particle swarm are randomly generated, and a satisfactory solution is repeatedly found according to formulas (3) and (4).In order to optimize the allocation of human resources, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm has found the best solution through personal collaboration. Its essence is to use each limit value information and all extreme value information to derive the next iteration of the particle [17]. Figure1is a sequence diagram of the particle optimization algorithm.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointFlow chart of particle optimization algorithm.Both the particle swarm optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm belong to optimization algorithms. They both simulate the adaptability of individual populations on the basis of natural characteristics and use certain transformation rules to solve them through space search.2.3.

The average kernel size can be set to any value smaller than the size of the input image.

The default base is the default refresh modes.The formula is as follows:(9)The mix of teamwork and casual work is a continuation of the LP idea. The random collection selects random values between the pool areas according to the specific odds distribution. Therefore, accurate nondynamic signaling should be transferred to the next stage of construction. The tank concentration can be described as a synergy between the mean concentration and the maximum concentration.(10)Research has shown that mixing condensate and random concentration compared to mean and maximum concentration is a normal function that helps prevent excessive neural network formation.2.3.3.

"of the evaluation, it is generally necessary to consider various scoring elements, such as an excellent evaluation (or evaluation group) and the weighted value of the evaluation. In general, the upper-level evaluation (or evaluation group evaluation) accounts for a relatively large weighted value, and other evaluations account for a relatively small weighted value. Here, priority is given to the four aspects of the level of excellence (or evaluation team), the level of the candidate, the level of colleagues, and the level of subordinates. According to the zoning system, each candidate is quantitatively evaluated, and the scores of employees for each ability element are obtained.

Image Model and Algorithm for Human Resource Optimization Configuration Based on FPGA and Microsystem AnalysisHuman resources have three attributes: importance, availability, and restriction. The amount of labor creation is the calculation formula of the value of human resources (v+m) = operating profit-production cost, depreciation of fixed assets, and period expenses of intangible assets. Through FPGA and the microsystem, the measurement dimension, personnel management, relative weight of work elements, correlation coefficient of the number of people, and resource allocation in human resource optimization are optimized and compared with the traditional human resource system.This paper conducts research on the image model and algorithm of human resource optimization configuration based on FPGA-based microsystem analysis. It mainly selects 18 key elements in the impact of human resource optimization configuration for statistical analysis of measurement dimensions, and analyzes the sample mean and standard deviation, and specific statistics.

The above table represents the relative weight of the job elements. After weighting, the applicant's comprehensive score on the ability elements can be obtained, as shown in the following table. It can be seen from Table3and Figure5that the ability elements valued by each position are different, so the weight ratio is also different. The most valued ability inW3 position isF3 ability, which accounts for 0.32; the most important ability inW7 position is alsoF3 position, which has reached 0.38, and the less needed ability isF1, and the weight coefficient is only 0.07.Table  3.Relative weight of post elements.F1F2F3F4F5F6W10.170.090.310.060.270.16W20.230.230.180.050.290.08W30.210.090.320.080.130.23W40.290.110.070.360.220.09W50.030.290.250.270.180.04W60.190.320.080.120.260.09W70.070.190.380.120.130.15W80.180.220.040.350.250.11Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointRelative weight of post elements.In the above table,M1-M10 represents 10 different applicants, andF1-F6 represents the six ability requirements of the positions applied for.

Table4shows the staff quality evaluation scores. From Figure6, it can be seen that the comprehensive scores of each candidate in each position are high and low because of the existence of the best match. For example,M1 scored only 62 points inF1, but the highest score inF5 was 95 points. Of course, there are candidates with higher comprehensive qualities that can meet the various requirements of the company's required positions, so the overall score is relatively high, such asM2 scored 89 points onF1,F2 scored 94 points,F3 scored 98 points,F4 scored 92 points,F5 scored 78 points, andF6 scored 67 points.Table  4.Personnel quality evaluation score.F1F2F3F4F5F6M1627983749492M2899498927867M3688555667988M4646965826394M5727387887463M6698559897466M7568165745981M8919769765769M9728788736452M10986790635771Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointPersonnel quality evaluation score.The correlation coefficient of the number of employees in Table5and Figure7is as high as 0.795, which has a certain relationship with work intensity.

ConclusionThis article focuses on the research of the optical model and algorithms of human resource optimization structure based on FPGA and microsystem analysis. In this article, we will focus on fine-tuning the particles in the traditional algorithm, in order to highlight the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm and to highlight the innovations of this algorithm. The research results show that the innovative algorithm in this article can really achieve a better distribution of human resources, which can enhance mobility and protect exceptional individuals. And to improve the importance of human resources, the most important functional requirement is personnel management, accounting for 72%. The ability elements evaluated by each position are different, so the weight ratio is also different, the weight coefficient value is relatively small, and the convergence speed is also obtained, a great improvement, which also shows that the number of people and the difficulty of the work have nothing to do with the main reasons for the working environment.The new substance of this article is a solid study combined with quantitative research to fully analyze research data first.

The models and algorithms proposed in this paper for the optimal configuration of human resources still have defects to a certain extent. For example, many companies do not have the conditions to use FPGA and microsystem analysis algorithms; in addition, all the achievable functions of FPGA algorithms rely on it is realized by hardware, and there is a big gap in design flexibility compared with general purpose processors. However, the innovative perspective of this article can provide some constructive reference opinions to a certain extent to help enterprises better realize the optimal allocation of human resources.Conflicts of InterestThe author states that this article has no conflict of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.References1Jaafar M.

"AbstractA large component of the Health Information Systems now comprises numerous independent apps created in the past that need to be merged to provide a more uniform service. In addition to affecting the Intelligent Health Board Functionality and dependability, the quality of these additional apps may also have an impact. A critical characteristic of the SHS's management and upkeep is the SHS's reliance on the real benefits provided to it. In speaking, an HMIS (Healthcare Management Information System) is a computer-based device that benefits medical practitioners to perform their duties more efficiently by coordinating all of their data.

"IntroductionCreating legally acceptable systems is a difficult software engineering task, particularly for systems that are subject to regulatory restrictions, like healthcare information systems. The ambiguity and domain-specific definitions present in governmental regulations are the source of this difficulty. Because of this, there is a critical business need to automatically assess privacy texts, extract rules, and then apply those rules throughout the supply chain. The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is used as an example in the current works that analyze health policies. Saudi Arabia's healthcare data warehouses have developed over the years, and this study looks at how important service enhancements in Saudi offer different perspectives on how premium initiative help in health may be accomplished as well as how this may be done. Researchers have created stages of development model to help explain how various medical practitioners have interacted with healthcare systems throughout history.Patient medical and nursing administration are the primary functions of hospitalization strategic planning (HMIS). In addition to maintaining track of patients and their medical histories, the hospital also maintains a record of vaccinations prescribed to treat, as well as knowledge of different illnesses and the medications that may be used to treat them [1].

"a record of vaccinations prescribed to treat, as well as knowledge of different illnesses and the medications that may be used to treat them [1]. All of these many tasks were formerly handled by hand by the operational cadre and physicians. As the demand for healthcare resources developed as a result of an increasing economy and an increased focus on individual protection and treatment approaches, it became more challenging to consistently complete all of these obligations. In addition to rapid and varied improvements in ICT, which hold a position of leadership and are a vital component in the shift from a traditional to a digital system, electronic health information management has become a necessity to automate all of the other operations. Failure to comply with these regulations might have serious financial and reputational repercussions for healthcare providers in addition to the risk of sensitive patient information being disclosed, which could harm patients' reputations and finances. Because of this, creating a legally compliant system is a difficult software engineering task and is acknowledged as a major problem, especially in systems governed by law. Ambiguities and domain-specific definitions present in governmental regulations are the source of this problem.

"regulations are the source of this problem. For instance, Saudi legislators intended for ambiguities in healthcare privacy legislation to be reinterpreted as business practices change and people's capacity to comply with regulations changes over time.The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve certain facets of healthcare is already being fulfilled. It will probably become crucial in the future to support clinical and other applications that lead to more intelligent and efficient operations and care. With more secure and interoperable data, AI is going to be a key driver of analytics, insights, and the decision-making process across health plan, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and health system companies today. Businesses that embrace adoption are likely to see immediate benefits from cost savings and long-term competitive advantage as a result of using AI to alter their goods and services and improve customer engagement.It was characterized as a comprehensive personal computer for the storage, manipulation, management, and retrieval of medical and administrative health data organizations [2]. To better understand a healthcare facility's IT infrastructure, consider it to be more than simply machines, Internet, and machine infrastructure components.

"and machine infrastructure components. It is about so many doctors' data and its ability to handle and store it. When it comes to medicine, it has the potential to cut expenses and enhance performance while eliminating the problems of inaccuracies in data storage, reporting, and retrieval that conventional facilities face. Benefits aside, the journey to implementing this ideal system is not without difficulties [3]. Some of these issues stem almost from the character of patient data, while others stem from complicated health informatics and its users. Hospital software has been the subject of several studies by academicians and practitioners from a wide range of fields.When it comes to running a facility's operational, budgetary, and surgical operations, a HIS is an indispensable tool [4]. By using computerized data processors to enhance clinical outcomes and administrative processes, healthcare information systems are a subset of health imaging [5]. The healthcare industry has benefited greatly from the use of information technology. Computational modeling and accompanying applications have been introduced into the medical environment throughout the early 1990s.

"capacities and kinds of community hospitals to remove costly, bulky, and challenging paper health history with digital information that will be much faster and more efficient and integrate numerous duties.As a result, the health information system (HMS) plays a very important role in designing, implementing, organizing, and overseeing the processes of the doctor's subdomains and so enables constructive goals and business objectives of implementing the hospital's strategic plan and achieving its goals [6]. Using HMS, hospitals may transition from one historical to a continuous evaluation and improvement and proportionality of treatment, which increases the nursing experience. HMS has been implemented at a large number of Saudi hospitals, spread out over many cities in the region. In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is the most prominent government agency and the principal provider of medical services. About 98 percent of all health expenses are funded by the MOH. Health information Systems (HIS) have been given high attention in Saudi healthcare institutions because of the growing consciousness of the need for improved treatment and also the consequent growing adoption.Many nations, including Saudi Arabia, are seeing an increase in sales for pharmaceutical tests and procedures due to reasons along with an aging population and the increasing citizen expectations for good health and well-being [7].

"an increase in sales for pharmaceutical tests and procedures due to reasons along with an aging population and the increasing citizen expectations for good health and well-being [7]. This is the case in Saudi Arabia as well. The subject of healthcare has become more important to various governments. To ensure that all residents have access to an affordable, high-quality healthcare system, government and international healthcare systems have been implemented throughout the last several decades. For regional medical professionals, these policies have presented a thorny issue. As a result of a variety of changes happening during the last two decades, the administration of hospitals has to adapt their computer networks. The main difference is that, by emphasising significant service innovations in Saudi Arabia, this suggested work offers many viewpoints on how cost-effective service excellence in healthcare may be attained. As a result, fresh lines of inquiry have been discovered. Healthcare Method is conducting this research to create a smart and safe system for managing medical records. This system should facilitate the entry of patient data, improve the management of doctor appointments, facilitate the flow of information across departments, and accurately archive patient data and diagnoses.2.

ObjectiveThe main purpose of this article is that key service innovations in Saudi Arabia give varied viewpoints on how cost-effective service excellence in healthcare might be accomplished. As a result, new research avenues have been identified. Healthcare System is conducting this study to create a smart and protective system for managing healthcare records. This system should make it easier to create patient data, better manage doctor schedules, allow information to flow smoothly from one department to the next, and precisely archive patient information and diagnoses.3. Review of LiteratureMarzouk and Othman [1] showed that institutional arrangements may be necessary for social sustainability to ensure that establishments are responsive to future requirements. Effects minimization was first used in previous research as a way to evaluate institutional practice.
