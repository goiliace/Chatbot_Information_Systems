"of establishing IFMISs, the Korean government also introduced the third generation fiscal management system, known as DBAS, in April 2004, which became fully operational in January 2007. Considering the well-acknowledged success factors of integrating financial management systems, as evidenced by previous studies conducted in other countries (e.g., Guess,2005), the development process of DBAS intended to run a complete integration of national finances, implement the system in a comprehensive manner rather than adopting an incremental approach, and train public information officials and professionals. This involved a meticulous 3-year preparation period. During the development phase of dBrain, the central government modified existing laws and regulations while concurrently developing new information systems. This was conducted to ensure a coherent alignment between the functionalities of this large-scale system and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape.The main objective of DBAS was to provide comprehensive management of national finances and real-time monitoring of relevant budget processes. Functioning as an integrated finance information system, DBAS enabled the processing of the entire finance functions, including program budget, double-entry bookkeeping and accrual-based cost accounting, settlement, and performance evaluation (Bae et al.,2013).

"program budget, double-entry bookkeeping and accrual-based cost accounting, settlement, and performance evaluation (Bae et al.,2013). The Digital Budget and Accounting Renovation Office was created to support the new development of DBAS with public officials from several ministries, certified public accountants, and IT experts. The Office was positioned to collaborate with the World Bank in organizing workshops with the purpose of constructing financial information systems and to collect data from several developed countries, such as the United States, Austria, and the United Kingdom. The intention of these efforts was to consult practical insights regarding the use of financial information systems, which facilitated modifications to be made to DBAS. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance (2011) conducted business strategy planning analysis and suggested that having an in-house enterprise resource architecture derived from the previous versions of financial management systems would be beneficial for the continuous updating of the dBrain system rather than the adoption of Enterprise Resouce Planning (ERP) that were used in developed countries (Jeong,2017).Although the management of public finances differs between developed and developing countries, there are foundational elements in constructing an integrated finance system that aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, accountability, and public participation in national fiscal management.

"and developing countries, there are foundational elements in constructing an integrated finance system that aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, accountability, and public participation in national fiscal management. Therefore, the dBrain system also adopted a basic framework based on the World Bank's treasury reference model, as proposed by Hashim and Allan (2001). However, the dBrain system was developed solely using domestic technologies, unlike some countries that heavily relied on using packaged ERP system software (Bae et al.,2013). The decision to develop in-house technologies for operating the dBain system is influenced by the challenges involved in modifying ERP application packages, which entail high costs, time constraints, and a shortage of skilled workforce (Kumar et al.,2002; Markus et al.,2000). These challenges are particularly relevant for developing countries that often require frequent changes in public finances but may lack adequate resources to support such modifications. Consequently, the development of in-house technologies grants the Korean central government full control over the dBrain system to effectively respond to changes in national and international environments.3 RECIPIENT COUNTRY-CENTERED STRATEGIES IN FRAMING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS3.1 Composing on-demand module applicationsDeveloping countries have adopted financial management information systems developed by prominent international institutions, such as the"
"STRATEGIES IN FRAMING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS3.1 Composing on-demand module applicationsDeveloping countries have adopted financial management information systems developed by prominent international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme, as well as donor countries providing official development assistance. In such cases, beneficiary countries often express high levels of satisfaction with the systems, despite not fully using their functionalities over time. Beneficiary countries have faced challenges in operating and maintaining the financial management system due to the lack of operational capacity. The complex nature of the systems, with numerous unnecessary functions that are viable only for countries with specific profiles, has hindered their accurate implementation in recipient countries. The design primarily driven by information technology does not adequately consider the financial realities of recipient countries, which results in incompatibility between the existing financial systems of recipient countries and the systems. It may eventually necessitate alterations or even rebuilding of the systems.When constructing a financial information system for developing countries, it should carefully evaluate its practical achievements.

"of the systems.When constructing a financial information system for developing countries, it should carefully evaluate its practical achievements. The financial information system may not be sufficiently customized to fit the financial situations of developing countries, as it often lacks a thorough investigation of their existing financial management information systems, including management of state coffers, budgets, financial systems, and others. Priorities of the system established from the supplier-side perspective of donor countries may significantly differ from the needs of recipient countries. A reasonable system module should meet the specific conditions of recipient countries' financial systems as they may only need basic functions of IFMIS, such as state fund and budget management and statement processing. However, donor countries focus on building high-end financial information systems with more functions than the necessary for recipient countries. Therefore, a recipient country-centered strategy is critical for the effective implementation of the adopted third-generation of the IFMIS, namely dBrain.The plan to export the dBrain system may not be practically feasible for recipient countries. Furthermore, the Korean government has even considered exporting the fourth generation of the dBrain system after it achieves stable operational status following its release in 2022.

"government has even considered exporting the fourth generation of the dBrain system after it achieves stable operational status following its release in 2022. While exporting the fourth generation dBrain plus system would be acceptable in many ways, it may not be strategically preferable. The fourth generation dBrain plus system is designed as an integrated solution that connects all national finance business processes in a unified manner, necessitating a large-scale structure. Developing countries may prefer more manageable systems, so that even the second-generation NaFIS system could be sufficient for their needs. The straightforward framework of the second-generation system can serve as a practical module for developing countries, allowing additional functions to be easily attached to the basic module as needed (Jeong & Oh,2019).The term \"module\" in the context of an FMIS refers to a sub-element or a system that allows the system to be more readily upgraded to meet future needs (Diamond & Khemani,2006). This module approach allows for a gradual expansion of the functionalities needed in the basic module. For example, if [Treasury Single Account (TSA) + statement processing] is the base module, additional modules can be attached based on future needs, such as budget, balancing account, national assets management, and property management can be added. Uña and Pimenta (2016) described that most Latin countries used a single ERP-type system extensively at the subnational"
"be attached based on future needs, such as budget, balancing account, national assets management, and property management can be added. Uña and Pimenta (2016) described that most Latin countries used a single ERP-type system extensively at the subnational level, while interoperating their IFMIS databases with others at the national level. In such cases, it would be beneficial to add additional functionality to the IFMIS in a modular way to reduce the burden on organizational capacity.With a module-based platform, developing countries can have the flexibility to extend the base module and assemble a personalized desktop computer that operates with central processing units, a mainboard with built-in graphics, hard disks, and memory. These parts can be integrated with the basic module, namely [TSA + statement processing], to operate independently. If a country needs a device to load external budget data, compact disc read-only memories can be attached, thereby encompassing the budget functionality within [TSA + budget + statement processing]. The additional external graphics cards can be also attached to provide a visualization of accounts settlement activities, extending the system to [TSA + budget + settlement + statement processing]. This customized approach enables effective management of both state funds and state property, thus improving overall financial governance.3.2 Strengthening maintenance and building capacitiesThe implementation of an IFMIS at the national level"
"This customized approach enables effective management of both state funds and state property, thus improving overall financial governance.3.2 Strengthening maintenance and building capacitiesThe implementation of an IFMIS at the national level requires a substantial commitment and continuous involvement of all relevant stakeholders (Diamond & Khemani,2006). Donor countries may seek recognition merely for establishing a financial information system in recipient countries, which they have received free of charge along with the necessary human and material resources. When surveying the use of IFMIS, beneficiary countries tend to report high satisfactory rates, even though they are not genuinely content with provided IFMIS systems. Donor countries then share these positive survey results with domestic and foreign countries.However, there is a noteworthy issue that needs attention, namely system maintenance. In general, donor countries offer a maintenance period of one to 2 years subsequent to the adoption of their systems by recipient countries. Nevertheless, it is important to consider a scenario in which recipient countries undertake revisions to their financial laws two or 3 years later, as their system modules require to be updated accordingly. In the event that the system module cannot be adequately modified to accommodate new changes in manual procedures and processing rules at a minimum, the system risks becoming obsolete. Therefore, it is critical for the maintenance"
"be updated accordingly. In the event that the system module cannot be adequately modified to accommodate new changes in manual procedures and processing rules at a minimum, the system risks becoming obsolete. Therefore, it is critical for the maintenance period to span at least five to 7 years to ensure the sustained functionality of the system in the long term. Although Uña and Pimenta (2016) suggested a minimum timeframe of four to 5 years, the extended maintenance period guarantees accurate assessment of the system's overall sustainability. Once the maintenance period is over, recipient countries should carefully evaluate the need to enhance the existing system's functionality or opt for a complete upgrade.Capacity-building programs play a critical role in the successful implementation of IFMIS. While system maintenance is vital for sustaining its functionality, the lack of necessary institutional capacities for staffing and organizational structures often leads to the new built-in functions' unsuccessful implementation. Capacity-related issues, particularly concerning personnel and relevant organizational operations, have been identified as common challenges for the successful implementation of financial systems in developing countries (Uña & Pimenta,2016; Vickland & Nieuwenhuijs,2005). It takes time to understand the system's functions for users, so making capacity-building programs is essential in the early development and implementation stages (Lundu & Shale,2015;"
"countries (Uña & Pimenta,2016; Vickland & Nieuwenhuijs,2005). It takes time to understand the system's functions for users, so making capacity-building programs is essential in the early development and implementation stages (Lundu & Shale,2015; Mwangi et al.,2016). Operating capacity-building programs should be continued to ensure effective use of the system by frontline ministries. These programs should be integrated with system maintenance efforts. Deploying personnel to recipient countries to provide on-site assistance in system use can be an effective option. By combining capacity-building programs with ongoing maintenance support, recipient countries can enhance their understanding of the system and maximize its potential.4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSWhen considering the adaptability and stability of the dBrain plus system in recipient countries, the Korean government should pay attention to whether the dBrain system can be effectively utilized based on the specific conditions and capacities of recipient countries. The Korean government should establish target strategies to ensure that the dBrain system can be practically customized for recipient countries, thus valuing efforts and resources invested in building the system. Instead of being content with the completion of system establishment in recipient countries, it is necessary to guarantee the system's effectiveness in achieving sustainable development outcomes once it is implemented.

"Instead of being content with the completion of system establishment in recipient countries, it is necessary to guarantee the system's effectiveness in achieving sustainable development outcomes once it is implemented. The construction or adoption of an IFMIS should not be viewed as a stand-alone solution.The dBrain system developed by South Korea exemplifies a standardized and centralized approach to managing national public finances compared to the IFMIS developed by countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. The dBrain system operates as a single centralized finance system at the national level, while incorporating decentralized operations to integrate sub-national entities. Moreover, the developmental phase of the dBrain system involved the modification of existing laws and regulations to provide the necessary support, along with the creation of new information systems to address potential challenges and improve system effectiveness. It is worth noting that the minimum prerequisites for successful adoption and implementation should be in place.Furthermore, system maintenance and capacity-building programs should be provided after adopting the system. The system's operations can be performed better when it accurately reflects the existing public financial systems of recipient countries, rather than being dominated by the perspectives of donor countries or international financial organizations. In the case of the Korean government's financial information"
"it accurately reflects the existing public financial systems of recipient countries, rather than being dominated by the perspectives of donor countries or international financial organizations. In the case of the Korean government's financial information systems, its second-generation logic should be sufficient (Jeong & Oh,2019). Large and complex financial information systems are unlikely to operate efficiently, leading to limited use by recipient countries. To develop a practical financial information system, recipient countries should adopt a modular approach, identifying specific subsets of IFMIS modules that align with their needs and existing budget systems. By doing so, they can quickly assemble a fully functioning adaptation. The roles and responsibilities of recipient countries in operating and managing the system must be taken into account during the developing process of dBrain modules. Adopting a recipient country-centered strategy is crucial as it allows for greater customization and systematic reflection of the recipient's perspectives during the adoption stage. This approach holds particular importance, given that developing countries often face limitations in terms of financial and personnel resources to develop their own IFMIS.The Korean government combined the off-the-shelf customization option, which used the products available on the market (Uña & Pimenta,2016), to develop an in-house centralized IFMIS.

"their own IFMIS.The Korean government combined the off-the-shelf customization option, which used the products available on the market (Uña & Pimenta,2016), to develop an in-house centralized IFMIS. Thus, the adoption of the dBrain system becomes a benchmark for setting a viable public financial information system, considering the economic and political conditions in developing countries in Africa, East Asia, and Latin America. Furthermore, developing countries should actively engage in the evaluation of necessary modules in an IFMIS and demonstrate a strong commitment to a long-term implementation path when considering its adoption. This is particularly important while receiving assistance and support from international institutions or donor countries for the success of their financial reforms.Open ResearchDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.REFERENCESBae, D.

IntroductionWith the deepening of education reform, the scale of postgraduate enrollment has been expanding, and the data to be recorded and processed in the training management work has increased exponentially. To standardize management and improve the level and efficiency of postgraduate training management, many universities have established postgraduate management systems and related teaching support platforms one after another to realize the collection, processing, and statistical functions of basic teaching information, which reduces the manual processing work of management personnel, improves the working efficiency, and brings great convenience to teachers and"

It reduces the manual work of management staff, improves work efficiency, and brings great convenience to the teachers and students of the school. However, from the perspective of the development trend of graduate education and teaching, there are still some unsuitable places in the informatization of graduate students in colleges and universities. However, from the perspective of the development trend of postgraduate education and teaching, there are still some unsuitable places for postgraduate informatization in colleges and universities, mainly in the following aspects: many postgraduate systems in colleges and universities were built earlier; the system construction did not follow the national standards and industry standards; the data structure and data content were not standardized; it is difficult to ensure the consistency of data, resulting in difficulties in information and data sharing between systems; and it is difficult to achieve an upgrade and maintenance of the system [2].

"to achieve an upgrade and maintenance of the system [2]. Many schools do not include the construction of graduate education informatization into a purposeful, planned, and step-by-step system engineering project, and even if there is a better hardware and software environment, it is difficult to mobilize most teachers and students to participate in the construction of education informatization to the greatest extent due to the lack of a corresponding standardized system and standardized management [3]. Many systems are designed from the needs of administrators, only designing management functions, with less support for cultivation management closely related to students' learning activities, which cannot support the whole process of graduate students' learning activities, making it difficult for administrators to track and monitor the completion and quality of graduate students' studies and ensure the smooth progress of research work [4]. After collecting a lot of teaching information into the system, it only does simple query and statistical functions without deep processing and lacks multidimensional statistical analysis functions, which makes it difficult to provide management decision analysis information to school leaders and managers.This study intends to draw on the development experience of other perfect systems, compare the more popular system development technologies, analyze the specific needs of the postgraduate training process in the light of the overall"

For example, the personnel information in the personnel system, the financial information in the financial system, the undergraduate major course information in the teaching service system, and the student accommodation information in the coordination management system, etc., to design a set of management information system suitable for the actual situation of postgraduate management. However, due to the lack of a corresponding standardized system and standardized management, it is difficult to mobilize teachers and students to devote themselves to the construction of educational information. Many system designs are based on the needs of managers, only designing management functions, and there is little support for training management that is closely related to student learning activities.

"various heterogeneous data in the digital campus, unifies the management of semistructured and structured data, eliminates information silos, and realizes real-time data sharing among systems [5]. For example, it provides authoritative data such as basic information of graduate students, cultivation, and degrees for the data sharing center; it extracts basic information of faculty personnel and additional information such as payment and accommodation of graduate students from the data sharing center, which ensures the consistency of data [6]. Before the design and architecture of the system, a prospective study on the data standards of the university was conducted, and the coding rules of human, financial, and material aspects were planned uniformly from the university, which laid a good foundation for the construction of the data sharing center in our university. In the design process of the postgraduate management information system, it is designed to exchange data from the digital campus shared data platform and reserve the data interface for public information calling from the university's portal or other systems calling.

"and carry out teaching assessments, which greatly saves the work pressure and work content of administrative teaching staff. Computer network technology allows each student to choose elective subjects independently through the computer, which provides sufficient autonomy for students and greatly improves work efficiency, allowing teaching staff to have more time to deal with other things and meet the needs of students at different stages.2. Current Status of ResearchAlthough the current university networked teaching management model has improved, it still lacks a lot of rationality and humanized design. Based on the above considerations, the development of an artificial intelligence-driven teaching management information system suitable for various needs is particularly important for improving the efficiency and quality of managers and enhancing the image of the school [7]. For example, the British scholar Aithal and others mentioned that some institutions in the UK and France have built information technology earlier, and each university focuses on the construction of a web platform in the academic affairs network management system [8]. Through decades of development, they already have a perfect and mature teaching system, teaching service system, office system, library system, campus entertainment system, and so on [9].

These system platforms have had a great impact on students, teachers, administrators, and community residents, facilitating students' spare time, improving office efficiency, improving learning environment and methods, and accelerating the pace of transformation of an information-based society [10]. The digital campus is better than UEAS Academic Affairs Management System, which combines the advantages of both and builds a better application system, deploying C/S computing mode for parts that need a lot of calculations, such as data import and data analysis, and B/S computing mode for parts that do not need too many calculations, such as information query and display [11]. The C/S computing mode is open to a few users who need it, and the B/S computing mode is developed for all users of the system [12].Many schools have established student information management systems, which provide a solid foundation for modern network education. The technical aspect of the management information system led to innovation and reform of the traditional office model, thus creating a previously unavailable, new form of efficient modern office model [13].

"[13]. As we all know, for the long-term sustainable development of each enterprise, there is a need for an efficient and convenient management system; they will mostly choose reliable public generally recognized software companies to cooperate in the development, but the required development costs and maintenance costs will become very difficult to bear, which for the market users, will be a cost-effective automated management information system [14]. This paper will design and study the most cost-effective management information system to meet this demand [15]. In the initial stage, the construction of information technology in universities only stopped at the registration and storage of data and only established a relatively closed local network on campus, and the individuals who used this network only used it in the local area network, and with the improvement of requirements, the university built a medium-sized campus network, which improved the efficiency of using the campus network and accelerated the improvement of teaching quality to a certain extent [16]. A large information center was built, and from the initial embryonic stage to the present day, a complete information system has been built, which has greatly improved the degree of digitalization of the school [17].

Analysis of Integrated Design of Information System for Graduate Education in Digital Campus Universities3.1. Technical Analysis of Graduate Student Education Information SystemThe system uses an on-demand B/S technology architecture. This system also uses a J2EE-based development framework and runtime environment to maximize the inclusion and integration of existing and to-be-built applications [19]. For example, provide the data sharing center with authoritative data such as basic information, training, and degrees of graduate students; extract basic information about teachers and workers from the data sharing center; and additional information such as postgraduate payment and accommodation to ensure the consistency of the data. The SOA service-oriented architecture simplifies the processing mode of business process integration between systems, simplifies the difficulty of cross-system interface integration due to changes in business requirements, and achieves loose coupling between systems [19].

"excellent performance is selected as powerful. A distributed software architecture is used to realize the integration of data, services, and business processes utilizing application integration, and the digital campus is built in steps under a unified top-level design. Each system operates independently, and cross-system invocation and collaboration are realized through standard and clear interfaces.The server is usually a high-performance PC, workstation, or minicomputer with a large database system such as Oracle or SQL Server. The B/S architecture has three main components: client browser, application publishing server, and database server, as shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointB/S architecture diagram.The construction of a digital campus is a long-term and continuous construction process that matches the strategy of the university. It is necessary to consider the results and data of the university's existing information technology construction, and at the same time, it is necessary to lay the foundation and indicate the direction for the future development of the university's information technology, so that the construction of the digital campus is a continuous improvement and continuous updating process over time and can effectively form the long-term accumulation of the university [20].

"are the primary factor affecting the continuous improvement of the quality of education and teaching in colleges and universities [22]. In Huizhou Engineering Vocational College, the college proposes to pay attention to the construction of a digital campus network system, and in the teaching-centered mode, it is necessary to guarantee good teaching quality and good teaching mechanism, precisely for the establishment of the current higher vocational college at the early stage, to establish an integrated working system platform, which has more efficient work efficiency compared with the traditional campus management and can also serve the teaching staff and students accurately [23]. It allows data to generate more shared value and establishes a data intervisiting mechanism. Focusing on on-campus information applications, it solves various current management problems and serves campus faculty and students. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of the digital campus academic affairs management system of colleges and universities and analyzes and discusses each functional module in the digital campus academic affairs management system of colleges and universities, which has a certain innovative value.Many colleges and universities implement the management mode of large academic affairs and put all the work related to education and teaching into academic affairs, so whether the school's academic affairs management is smooth and the quality of academic affairs"
"and universities implement the management mode of large academic affairs and put all the work related to education and teaching into academic affairs, so whether the school's academic affairs management is smooth and the quality of academic affairs management is directly related to the quality of education and teaching. In recent years, Huizhou Engineering Vocational College has been upgraded to a higher vocational college by merging several secondary schools, and the management mode needs to be changed continuously. At the same time, as the college continues to expand and transform, the academic administration will also face increased pressure. To maximize the inclusion and integration of existing and to-be-built applications, through the SOA service-oriented architecture, it simplifies the processing mode of business process integration between systems, simplifies the difficulty of cross-system interface integration due to changes in business requirements, and realizes loose coupling between systems. To adapt to the changing needs of academic affairs management, the traditional manual work can no longer meet the needs of complex academic affairs information management, which requires us to change our concept and adopt modern means to manage the current academic affairs information and continuously improve the management of academic affairs management for all teachers and students of the school, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall business"
"modern means to manage the current academic affairs information and continuously improve the management of academic affairs management for all teachers and students of the school, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointOverall business data information flow of digital campus.The construction of a digital campus requires the school to establish its own data code rules, and to the maximum extent consistent with the education management informatization standard (Ministry of Education), relevant national standards, and relevant industry-standard codes, reduce the duplication of code usage, and consider the need for future code expansion for the construction and maintenance of code rules, i.e., school-defined data standard rules. The database server adopts a minicomputer system, and through physical partitioning technology, the informatization campus database and the one-card database are run separately in different partitions, while a separate partition is used as the environment for database testing and development. It is planned to add a set of disk array systems with the same configuration as the main storage system in the offsite server room as the offsite disaster recovery center and realize the synchronous or asynchronous partial or complete replication of data from the main storage center to the disaster recovery center through the configuration of fiber optic switch plus long-distance transmission interface module and data mirroring software.The"

The outermost layer is a dedicated hardware load-balancing device and can be deployed as a dual-computer active-active high availability mode, which is responsible for providing load balancing and high availability guarantee for HTTP (80) traffic from users to the HTTP front-end server; the middle is two WebSphere HTTP servers, which act as task schedulers for the back-end. These two HTTP front-end servers function as task schedulers of the information portal platform and digital campus application servers at the back-end and are responsible for providing load balancing and high availability for user requests to access the information portal and application systems at the back-end; the back-end is a WebSphere Application Server Cluster member server. The construction of the digital campus is a process of continuous improvement and renewal over time, which can effectively form the long-term accumulation of the school.

The graduate school and all colleges adopt the computer-aided manual scheduling method according to the courses already offered in the current semester to determine the teachers, time, and location of each course, and the system provides strict conflict verification of teachers and classroom resources and provides automatic generation and query functions of the curriculum. Students can be scheduled manually during the scheduling process, and the system will automatically check whether students have conflicting class times. When scheduling classes in a new semester, the training office or college can refer to previous scheduling information and copy the scheduling information of certain courses as needed to reduce the maintenance workload.3.2.

Digital Campus Environment Living SystemThe smart campus software system is the window of the school's informatization construction, which can show the information of each interface for students and can allow users to easily find the desired information or resource portal, etc, reduce code reuse rate, consider the need for future code expansion, and carry out the construction and maintenance of code rules, that is, calibrate data standard rules. The database server adopts a minicomputer system and runs the information campus database in different partitions through physical partition technology. All the platform systems of the smart campus should be reflected in the school portal, and school news and notices can be released in time to show the development and progress of the campus. The construction of the campus information portal is not only a window for the school to display to the outside world but also an important platform for teachers, students, faculty members, and other personnel to carry out unified identity authentication, based on which the entrance to other application systems can be easily found, providing great convenience to users.

If the campus information portal is not well planned, it will be difficult to carry out the whole digital campus construction in depth. The training office or college can refer to the past scheduling information and copy the scheduling information of certain courses as needed to reduce the maintenance workload. The information portal is a center of various information collections, which can provide relevant information inquiry and release some information related to the column, which will be displayed on the school's portal after review. The campus portal is a large network platform integrating news release, content management, video on demand, image retrieval, full-text search, and other functions, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSchematic diagram of the unified login and authentication process.An intelligent access control system uses a card access control machine, license plate recognition, remote identification, and other access control equipment for linkage integration. In addition to controlling the entry and exit of vehicles, it can further calculate and control the number of live-restricted parking spaces, strengthen the antitheft/prevention function, and make the vehicles pass through the entrances and exits more effectively identified and managed [25].

All-important departments of the college, training areas, and machine rooms are accessed using access cards, and the permissions of each faculty member and student can be managed in the background. On this basis, it can be combined with a personnel attendance system to realize intelligent attendance and unified access to the college network for remote management. The digital campus is a system that takes the network and digital information as the basis and makes the teaching resources more fully utilized by students, teachers, and managers. Teachers, in addition to having the same operation rights as students, can also access the teaching videos and animations of relevant courses through this system. Administrators can use this system to efficiently integrate school-related information and can release daily school arrangements to students and teachers through this platform, such as notification of school closures and power outages, so that the information notified to students, teachers, and other administrators can be notified within the first time. The above are the functions that can be provided by the smart card, but some additional functions will be added later to improve the interface of the system, to improve the quality of the system to achieve the purpose of improving the core competitiveness.It"

The system replaces the campus card with the library card. Students need to verify their identity when entering the library, and they need to swipe their cards at the card machine at the entrance of the library before the library will open, and they also need to swipe their cards to register their identity information when borrowing books. Through this system, the relevant information of the school can be efficiently integrated, and the daily arrangements of the school can be released to students and teachers through this platform, such as the notice of rest and power outage, so that the information notified by the school can be notified in the first-time students, teachers, and other administrators. The system uses the student card instead of the key, when students enter the dormitory need to brush the card, identity verification, only in the corresponding dormitory building student card can open the dormitory door, in the dormitory such as the population, male and female dormitory main channel, training building entrance to install access control equipment, access control system is conducive to"

The consumption system mainly includes the meal charge system for teachers and students, the supermarket charge system, and the drinking water charge system. The main function of the consumption system is to make the daily consumption of students and teachers inside the school safer and more transparent, for example, eating in the school's dining hall will send the daily consumption records to the APP, which can show the dining consumption for a month and the average daily consumption, etc. In addition, other consumption of students inside the school will also be recorded, such as drinking water and supermarkets, in which no cash consumption and old card spending.Teachers and students will be integrated with the comprehensive application system to realize data sharing so that the comprehensive application system for teachers and students will become a whole and create a convenient, fast, and humanized campus electronic life for teachers and students.

It is a comprehensive information platform for teachers and students to enroll, teach, train, live, seek jobs, learn skills, graduate, and resign. Nowadays, in the era of rapid development of information technology, this is both an opportunity and a challenge for the school management system. The establishment of an integrated work system platform has more efficient work efficiency than traditional campus management and can also accurately serve faculty, staff, and students, to a greater extent, allow data to generate more shared value and establish a data exchange mechanism. On the one hand, the background of this era provides a more excellent network environment for the information system, and on the other hand, the information system faces more dangers due to the rapidly developing network environment. While the business is expanding, the emergence of education administration system not only provides users with a convenient and quick way to manage various tedious education affairs but also liberates the education department, streamlining administration, reducing recurring expenses, and using existing resources can bring greater benefits, as shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointManagement system function module.Nowadays, in the era of rapid development of information"

The system can greatly simplify and standardize this process, realize information sharing and business collaboration between the upper and lower departments, and connect with departmental budgeting, recruitment, accounting, and fund clearing systems. The establishment of an online payment system mainly solves the problem of reimbursement of research funds. In colleges and universities, teachers conduct various kinds of research, in which the accounting and issuance of funds generated is a complex process. This system can greatly make this process streamlined and standardized; realize information sharing and business collaboration between upper- and lower-level departments; connect with a departmental budget, procurement, accounting processing, and fund clearing systems; realize asset change application; approve financial accounting; and realize the whole life cycle management of the whole assets.4.

After the test cases executed, the exceptions are followed up to ensure that these developed products meet the detailed regulations. When designing the above test cases, the status of illegal user input and boundary conditions should be analyzed. The user's software should be tested to prevent any surprises. Confirmation of the test results should be carried out, and the errors of the test are often determined by another person when carrying out the confirmation. For the more prominent problems, a meeting can be considered to discuss and determine. With the help of the test results, it is possible to find out if the problem exists and the severity of the problem. The design goal of the test case for adding student status is to test whether the function of adding student status can be used to verify whether the user's input information is legal.

"technology architecture based on J2EE architecture is designed with high efficiency and reusability, which makes the system have good maintainability and portability. While managing the system, the only data format standard belonging to the graduate system was established, which lays the foundation for the later digital campus integration construction, simplifies the steps of sharing data, and improves the operational efficiency of the system. This study focuses on the technical solution design for the needs of a single application system of the postgraduate management information system. The digital campus construction will have a large amount of personal information about the transmission, the vast majority of which can be said to carry confidential information, and the orientation of information also requires communication and coordination between school departments and authorization.Conflicts of InterestAll the authors do not have any possible conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.References1Nur Ain Basri S.,Ahmad F.,Izie Adiana Abidin N.,Baba I.,Harun H.,Hazren Abdul Hamid N.,Awang M.,Ashraf Abdul Rahman M.,Kamaruzaman Musa M.,Hamidon N.,Ahmad S.,Ahmad S.,Ahmad S., andAzhan Ishak S.,Digital campus,International Journal of Engineering & Technology.

"AbstractBased on the concept of \"smart tourism,\" this paper designs and implements a tourism management information system based on PSO-optimized NN. The foreground tourism web page of the system adopts DIV + CSS mode for page planning and layout, PHP as the client script language, and SQL server as the database to store and analyze user information. At the same time, the system adds personalized components to the user's search ranking results, so that the routes and scenic spots presented in front of users in the result interface are more in line with users' consumption habits. In order to verify the performance of the model and algorithm constructed in this paper, several experiments were carried out in this paper. Experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of this algorithm is 94.67% and the recall rate is 96.11%. This algorithm can overcome the disadvantages of traditional algorithms and provide some effective suggestions for tourism management. At the same time, this paper applies the concept of \"smart tourism\" to specific tourism informatization, which can promote the transformation and upgrading of tourism industry structure and further enhance the overall development level of tourism industry.1.

"informatization contributes significantly to the growth of tourism and is increasingly becoming a key competitive advantage in global resource allocation [1]. The three major industries in the world are tourism, automobiles, and oil, and tourism is also known as the \"smokeless industry.\" The tourism industry has grown rapidly in tandem with the improvement of people's living standards, but it has also brought many problems. Travel agencies currently deal with a large amount of data, with low efficiency and significant errors. With the advancement of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, many people are turning to holiday tourism to relieve stress and relax [2]. As a result, people's demand for tourism will continue to rise. It is critical to develop a tourism management information system that meets application requirements and has comprehensive functions in order to better adapt to the current market situation. Wisdom tourism is a higher-level and more comprehensive guiding strategy for tourism informatization development, as well as a more profound embodiment of the value of tourism informatization development. With the rapid advancement of computer technology, database management systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated [3].

"increasingly sophisticated [3]. People are gradually paying attention to modern enterprise management as a result of the establishment of scientific management systems and the popularisation of modern computer management mode, particularly due to the rapid development of computer technology and modern communication technology [4]. The use of computer-assisted management emerged and grew quickly. The importance of carrying out informatization construction in the tourism industry is both theoretical and practical.People's office efficiency and cost savings can be greatly improved with a tourism management system. However, tourism development is currently slow, and there is no effective management strategy in place. Enterprises with poor information management are less efficient. It is not smooth due to a lack of informatization, a single management mode, and limited communication channels in the tourism administrative department. The tourism industry's development is hampered by these issues. Simultaneously, how to quickly and accurately find high-quality information from the vast amount of Internet data; how to thoroughly analyze customers' consumption habits and formulate user strategies is an important field of Internet technology research [5].

"research [5]. As an information processing system that mimics biological neurons, the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) offers non-linear approximation, parallel processing, self-learning, self-organization, and fault tolerance. As a result, it has some advantages in terms of practical application. The most widely used NN (Neural network) model is the Bpnn (Back propagation neural network) [6]. To adjust the weight, BPNN typically uses the gradient descent method. However, it has some flaws, such as the ability to fall into local minima, slow convergence speed, and easy oscillation [7]. This paper introduces PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), which is used to train the weights and thresholds of NN in order to address these flaws. This paper builds a tourism management information system based on PSO-optimized NN based on the concept of \"smart tourism.\" The following are some of its innovations:(i)This paper mainly researches and develops the system according to the idea of software engineering design, and uses a variety of cutting-edge technologies to complete the establishment of tourism management information system. Aiming at the time-consuming problem faced by users in choosing tourist routes, this paper puts forward a brand-new price comparison decision method.

In this paper, an improved PSO-optimized NN algorithm is proposed, aiming at its inherent defects of falling into local minima, slow convergence and easy oscillation.

Related WorkWith the fierce competition of more and more tourism industries, how to improve the service quality and management of tourism is becoming more and more important. At the same time, with the rapid development of mobile Internet, cloud computing, AI and other technologies, the integration of tourism industry and IT industry is getting closer and closer. among them, ANN has been well applied in many fields. At present, many scholars have combined NN with tourism and made some achievements.In order to improve the prediction accuracy of popular tourist attractions, Du et al. proposed a prediction model of popular tourist attractions based on genetic algorithm optimization [8]. Zhou et al. used use cases for travel service recommendation [9]. This model organizes the user's historical data into case forms and stores them; when the user has a demand, the system will search through the case by the method of similarity calculation to find the case that is close to the user's needs; The case is adjusted according to local needs and a recommended"
"case forms and stores them; when the user has a demand, the system will search through the case by the method of similarity calculation to find the case that is close to the user's needs; The case is adjusted according to local needs and a recommended solution is generated. Liu et al. introduced the radial basis function NN with strong non-linear modeling ability to describe the non-linear change characteristics of popular tourist attractions, and optimized the parameters of the radial basis function NN to establish the optimal prediction model of tourist attractions [10]. Bai and Han made dynamic prediction of tourist attractions based on grey system and NN [11]. Lv uses the improved genetic algorithm to optimize the structure and initial weight of the BPNN in the research of improving the genetic algorithm to optimize the BPNN for prediction [12]. In the PSO optimization NN prediction model, Zhao et al. used PSO to optimize the weight parameters of the BP network [13]. This method improves the problem that the BP network is easy to fall into the local minimum value, and improves the convergence speed. The system proposed by Sundriyal et al. uses demographic information to recommend tourist attractions, and classifies users by using Bayesian methods and support vector machines; and assumes that users in the same class have similar interests and preferences, recommending similar Other attractions of interest to users to solve the cold start problem [14].

"by using Bayesian methods and support vector machines; and assumes that users in the same class have similar interests and preferences, recommending similar Other attractions of interest to users to solve the cold start problem [14]. It has a certain effect. Du achieves a balance between the global search and local search of particles through the linear decrease of the inertia weight and acceleration factor of the PSO, and improves the optimization performance [15]. Behjaty and Monfared proposed a PSO-optimized NN ensemble tourism prediction model based on support vector machines [16]. Zhang designed a tourism demand forecasting system based on BPNN. The system can dynamically predict tourism demand and has good prediction accuracy [17].This paper discusses the mode of \"smart tourism\" and builds a tourism management information system based on PSO optimized NN based on an in-depth review of relevant literature. To begin, an improved PSO optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weight parameter combination of the BPNN model repeatedly. The algorithm is then used to precisely optimize the obtained network parameters. Finally, for prediction, the most accurate optimal parameter combination is used.

Finally, the experimental simulation demonstrates that the improved method presented in this paper improves the accuracy of prediction results while requiring few parameters and being simple and effective.3. Methodology3.1. Tourism Management Information System and NN AlgorithmThe brain is the most complex, perfect and effective information processing system known in the universe. The number of nerve cells in the brain is huge, and these nerve cells are also called neurons. It is hundreds of millions of such neurons that make up our human brain through complex connections. Neurons are the only cells in human body that can sense stimulation and conduct shock, and are also the basic units of nervous system in morphology, structure, function and nutrition. Inspired by the bionics research of ANN [18-20], the operation mode of brain neurons was simulated. NN has the characteristics of massive parallelism, learning autonomy, high nonlinearity and self-organization, and is widely used in many fields. ANN is a complex network composed of a large number of simple components connected to each other. It has a high degree of nonlinearity, and is a system that can perform complex logical operations and realize non-linear relationships. ANN can process information, and its core idea is to adjust"
"large number of simple components connected to each other. It has a high degree of nonlinearity, and is a system that can perform complex logical operations and realize non-linear relationships. ANN can process information, and its core idea is to adjust the connection relationship between internal nodes according to the different complexity of the system. It has all the characteristics of non-linear dynamic system, such as irreversibility, various types of attractors, chaos and so on. BPNN is the most commonly used NN model at present. Because of its good adaptability and strong non-linear mapping ability, BPNN has been widely used, but it also has some shortcomings. For example: ① the random initialization assignment of BP network connection weight and threshold before network model training makes the network easy to fall into local extreme points and affects the accuracy of prediction. ② For the determination of BPNN structure, there is no exact formula for the number of hidden layer nodes. Improper selection is prone to over fitting or insufficient learning ability, which affects the generalization ability of the network. BPNN model generally has input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The neurons in adjacent layers are fully connected, and there is no connection between neurons in each layer. The structure of NN is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointNN structure.BPNN is a multilayer feedforward NN with two processes: forward transmission of"
"are fully connected, and there is no connection between neurons in each layer. The structure of NN is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointNN structure.BPNN is a multilayer feedforward NN with two processes: forward transmission of input signals and error back propagation. Various neurons in a feedforward network accept the previous layer's input and output to the next layer without receiving feedback. There are two types of nodes: input cells and calculation cells. There can be any number of inputs, but only one output per computing unit. The basic idea behind the BPNN algorithm is to first initialise the weight and threshold of NN, and then calculate the corresponding output value using the transfer function between NN layers; finally, calculate the error between the output value and the expected output value, and then reverse the weight and threshold of NN. NN is trained by performing forward and reverse error corrections repeatedly. The operation is terminated when the error value reaches the set standard. The neuron state of each layer only affects the neuron state of the next layer in the BPNN model. To approach any rational function with any accuracy, the network structure usually only requires a single hidden layer. The number of neural nodes in the input and output layers of the network is determined by the dimension of the input and output vectors of training samples. The characteristics of neurons, the form of neuron interconnection, and"
"a single hidden layer. The number of neural nodes in the input and output layers of the network is determined by the dimension of the input and output vectors of training samples. The characteristics of neurons, the form of neuron interconnection, and learning rules are the three factors that determine NN's overall performance. We must improve the BPNN model's inherent flaws in order to better apply it. PSO stands for swarm intelligence optimization. The algorithm is simple to use and is used in a variety of optimization problems. This paper will build a tourism management information system using a PSO optimized NN algorithm.The development of information and Internet technology has completely changed people's life, and the intellectualization of tourism management has also become a trend. At present, the websites of travel agencies all over the country are in their own array in terms of function, information service and business operation, and the phenomenon of \"information island\" is serious [21]. The tourism management information system is convenient, which can manage, store and share resources through the network and various types of tourism resources. It greatly saves the labor cost, reduces the work difficulty and improves the intelligent level of the tourism industry.

"and improves the intelligent level of the tourism industry. Continuously improve the level of tourism informatization management, optimize the allocation of resources, and realize the industrial chain of enterprises; It can promote the development of enterprises, expand employment and realize the positive role of tourism economic development. Therefore, developing a tourism management information system that can not only store but also update and query data is critical. The requirements for building various formats of informatization in smart tourism are extensive. The creation of a smart travel agency, for example, necessitates the network realization of various functions such as data collection and resource procurement, product planning and release, product sales, tourist service, order management, team management, statistical settlement, and so on. However, in the current reality, only a few tourism businesses use the network to carry out the aforementioned functions. The tourist route can be inquired by inputting tourist places; Travel agency management route; Recommended by popular scenic spots; Scenic spot reservation; Order processing, and so on are the main functions of a tourism management information system that can satisfy the application. It should also have a user-friendly interface and provide appropriate operation tips. Decision-making is central to management, and prediction [22,23] is the foundation of decision-making.

"can satisfy the application. It should also have a user-friendly interface and provide appropriate operation tips. Decision-making is central to management, and prediction [22,23] is the foundation of decision-making. In tourism development and planning research, we should employ appropriate forecasting methods and models to determine the tourism economy's development law, as well as predict and speculate on tourism's future development trend, direction, and possibility, in order to better serve tourism planning, project decision-making, and management. Before developing an application system, we must understand the design and actual requirements of the system, assess the technology and principle's feasibility, and plan for development. The system should be simple to use once it has been launched, and most ordinary users with Internet experience should be able to use it without difficulty. At the same time, system administrators must have a thorough understanding of computers. General computer-related professionals can become competent after reading the instruction book. The paper then provides an overview of the system's overall design and implementation functions, as well as the system's overall test and trial operation, using an example design.3.2.

It is concerned with network applications. The function, or purpose, of a network management system should be the first step in its development [24]. The functional requirements are usually to clearly express a network management theme, to accommodate various types of content, and to adapt to various resolutions. Second, the design structure should be obvious. Because there are so many databases in this system, the databases must be designed ahead of time. It is the foundation of the data tourism management information system, the core content of the smart tourism city construction, and it provides crucial data support for the application service system construction. A data dictionary is made up of data items, data storage, data flow, data structure, and data processing, with data items being the smallest unit of the data dictionary. Data items make up the data structure. Data structure and data items are used to describe the data dictionary. A solution system for industry-wide data perception is proposed in this planning scheme, which is integrated into tourism intelligence data based on industry-wide data.

"which is integrated into tourism intelligence data based on industry-wide data. Many weight adjustment methods for BPNN algorithms based on gradient descent exist, but they all have drawbacks, such as slow convergence, long training times, and global convergence. PSO's optimization process is independent of gradient information, and it does not require that the function be differentiable or that the derivative be excessive. PSO is used as the NN training method in this paper to reduce NN training time and improve search efficiency. The flow chart of optimizing PSO NN algorithm is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointPSO optimization NN algorithm flow.A perfect system should have good stability, reliability, security and scalability, and can run efficiently. Therefore, this system meets the following performance requirements: ① correctness. ② Reliability. ③ Easy practicality. ④ Maintainability. ⑤ Reusability. ⑥ Understandability. ⑦ Safety. ⑧ Effectiveness. The system's basic information data for users primarily consists of gender, age, occupation, city, and historical comment items, while the comment data primarily consists of the user's comment text information on previous tourism service items and the corresponding scores.

The system also allows for real-time online operation, and the front page of timeliness and variability consistently sets high standards. The establishment of tourism data security standards ensures the security of data circulated in the tourism industry. Data transmission security standards, data storage security standards, and data exchange security standards are all included in the construction. Traditional linear modeling methods cannot accurately describe influencing factors and tourist attractions because they have a strong non-linear relationship. In order to fit the non-linear relationship between influencing factors and tourist attractions, this paper uses PSO to optimize NN. This paper uses a three-layer NN with only one hidden layer for the topological structure of NN in order to balance the algorithm's simulation and prediction accuracy, and because the more hidden layers, the more over-fitting of practical problems will occur. The number of nodes in the input layer represents the dimension of the original data, while the number of prediction indexes represents the number of nodes in the output layer.

The objective function expression is(7)In the formula,Nrepresents the total number of training samples,firepresents the square error sum of the objective function;y(k) andym(k) represent the target output value and actual output value of the objective function, respectively.The related parameters are coded based on the setting of the NN structure, and the optimization dimension is represented by the weights and thresholds of the NN connection. Using cyclic iteration, the number of hidden layers is determined, and the optimal number and weight of NN hidden layers are found. The optimal position of the current particle and PSO is updated based on the fitness function value. Then, to generate a new group of PSO, update each particle's position and velocity. The individuals in the improved PSO optimization algorithm are coded into the weights and thresholds of the three-layer feedforward NN structure. Set the variable value intervals in the improved PSO optimization algorithm, then randomly initialise PSO's position and speed within the initialization range. The performance of particle local search and global search will decrease if the inertia factor of PSO is linearly adjusted, according to the basic PSO.

The network is trained and the results are shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointTraining results of different networks.It can be seen that the convergence speed of this network is faster. In this paper, PSO is combined with NN, and the weight and threshold of NN are determined by using improved PSO instead of BPNN based on gradient descent. Therefore, the optimal parameter combination is obtained for NN to forecast the tourist volume in tourist areas. Three different models are used to predict the test set, and the prediction results are compared and the performance is analyzed. Test the recall results of different algorithms at the same time.

"requirements and provide some effective suggestions for tourism management decision-making.5. ConclusionsThe development of the tourism industry has been accelerated by the rapid development of computer technology, and the traditional tourism industry has changed dramatically. As a result, a tourism management information system with high availability, expandability, and ease of maintenance is required. This paper completes the construction and application of a tourism management information system using a PSO-optimized NN algorithm. The improved PSO is used to optimize BPNN in this paper, and the PSO's optimization performance is improved by nonlinearly decreasing the inertia factor. Simultaneously, the system provides end-to-end service, including system setup, management personnel analysis of tourism resource management, and statistical category reports. This can provide a great deal of convenience for visitors and have a significant positive impact on tourism benefits. Several experiments were conducted in order to verify the performance of the model and algorithm developed in this paper. The prediction accuracy of this algorithm is 94.67 percent, and the recall rate is 96.11 percent, according to experimental results.

"This system uses the Scrapy framework to crawl travel website route information, allowing it to efficiently and accurately capture travel route information; providing a user registration interface, clustering users based on user information, and storing user clicks in different categories on different lines; and rearranging route information to make search results more personalized and accurate. The system's performance is adequate for the application's needs. At the same time, this paper applies the concept of \"smart tourism\" to specific tourism informatization, which can help the tourism industry transform and upgrade its structure, as well as improve its overall development level. This research has made some achievements, but due to the time problem and the limitation of knowledge level, there are still many deficiencies in this system. In the future, distributed crawling and distributed storage should be considered to improve the system performance. At the same time, a more humanized interface should be designed.Conflicts of InterestThe authors do not have any possible conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by the Research Fund for Hainan Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Circles, Research on the Impact of the Entry of International High-End Hotel Brands on the Promotion of Tourism Image in Hainan and Their Image Fit (HNSK(ZC)21-134), and Research Fund for Hainan Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Circles, Research on Kinetic"

"AbstractIn the era of rapid development of information, with the popularization of computers, the development of science and technology, and the continuous growth of IT technology and business, the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system has become a platform and guarantee for the completion of business management processes after long-term operations. Establishing a logistics management information system is an important means for Chinese companies to improve their logistics efficiency. This is the prerequisite for modern companies to gain a competitive advantage in the management of logistics companies. Therefore, organizations must adapt to different needs, fierce competition, and rapid strategic changes. This is a powerful supplement to the nature of logistics companies. The logistics management information system has continuously experienced the processes of MRP, MRP II, and ERP. This article aims to study how to use computers in logistics management to create an ERP system-based enterprise logistics information management system. This article puts forward the development significance of logistics information management system, uses ERP system to analyze complex logistics business in detail, and designs the overall framework, specific functions, and data model of the system in detail.

"framework, specific functions, and data model of the system in detail. The experimental results of this paper show that the ERP system has important application value in the logistics information management system of supply chain enterprises, and it can effectively increase the value of customer satisfaction by 86.7%.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of human society, people's social work isolation has improved, and the relationship between enterprises has become closer. In order to provide more transportation and higher data management for cooperation between enterprises, especially with the rapid development of the industry, logistics information management based on information, automation, network, and intelligent information is the most important feature of modern logistics information management. With the continuous development of logistics enterprises, the company's logistics information management has also developed day by day, and related operators have become more and more important. At the same time, modern business development is inseparable from many partners in today's business management. The entire business supply chain is an object that enterprises need to pay special attention to in supply chain management.

"Knowing the resources, information, and data of suppliers and customers in a timely and accurate manner and extracting valuable information from relevant information to provide customer service is an unparalleled effective support condition for enterprises in competition. Logistics services are an indispensable part of corporate services. It is essential to improve the competitiveness of the organization. The development of science and technology has brought about a fundamental change in the competition of traditional companies, which is no longer the traditional competition of geographical regions. Good logistics management methods can significantly reduce logistics management costs and improve the value proposition of the business. Today, economic globalization is growing faster, and the depth and breadth of commercial product development are also increasing. This puts forward new requirements for organizational development, requiring organizations to meet their needs. At the same time, enterprises need to continuously improve, improve competitiveness, improve logistics management methods, and improve logistics management levels [1].By studying the current status, existing problems, and actual needs of the current logistics management system, we design a management information system for logistics management. It helps to accelerate the automation of logistics management, and the rapid development of computer applications leads to the development of business management."
"management system, we design a management information system for logistics management. It helps to accelerate the automation of logistics management, and the rapid development of computer applications leads to the development of business management. Increasing social competition and widespread use of information force companies to adapt to social trends and require management automation to improve the competitiveness of industry organizations. With the development of China's logistics industry and the development of traditional self-recording methods that the company cannot cover, this is also conducive to improving the efficiency of logistics management business processing. The company's business needs are increasing, and customers want speed and the most accurate service. It has also become a standard for customers to evaluate companies, so how to improve business processing efficiency and management has become a key issue hindering the development of manufacturing companies. The system can help organizations build a comprehensive logistics system, which plays an important role in improving employee productivity and managing logistics automation.Jagoda and Samaranayake put forward the conceptual framework of ERP system implementation by combining the state gate method with the preimplementation roadmap.

"by combining the state gate method with the preimplementation roadmap. It is found that an alternative integrated method based on the phase gate method is proposed to implement the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will enhance the effectiveness of the ERP project [2]. However, it is far from enough to build a conceptual framework. The theory and practice should also be combined. At present, choosing the right enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is the main challenge facing business managers. Jafarnejad A proposes a combined multicriteria decision (MCDM) method [3], which will determine the most important use of Shannon entropy technology for ERP selection standard. Through this method, the previous research results can be integrated, and the judgment of industry experts or organizational managers can also be integrated to select the appropriate ERP system [4]. However, this method only discusses the choice of ERP system and does not have an in-depth understanding of how the ERP system is applied. Many researchers have studied various key success factors and different reasons for the failure of ERP implementation projects. Although there are detailed literature forecasts, the purpose of this research by Aleksander is to develop and evaluate the main human factor (PHF) model and confirm the significant impact of PHF on the success of traditional CSF and projects [5]. However, the development of the main human critical success factor model for the"
