The experimental results are shown in Table1. The result corresponding to ES is the optimal solution.1.Average DAG offload scheduling delay of each algorithm under MLO purpose (milliseconds).Number of nodesESLEOERSRRHEFTDRLOSM10476.4723.0610.6612.6605.2514.5489.715643.61,053.5870.1862.1832.5719.6660.620826.11,394.51,160.11,080.11,068.1925.4852.425N/A1,796.01,428.81,370.11,313.31,145.51,017.530N/A2,154.61,736.41,648.71,591.81,399.11,236.435N/A2,463.61,973.51,958.11,907.71,665.41,468.540N/A2,910.42,414.72,192.02,114.11,864.41,679.745N/A3,182.02,480.52,271.92,187.51,955.51,678.650N/A3,663.13,118.02,725.22,572.72,287.62,082.5In addition, based on the purpose of MLO, the next step is to retrain the offload scheduling strategy of DRLOSM in different environments and evaluate the impact of different environments on the performance of all algorithms. To obtain the best reference solution for the experiment, the size of the DAG node is limited to 15 (too complicated for the time required by the exhaustive method) [7].

Figures3and4, respectively, show the average DAG offload scheduling delay of each algorithm in the test set at different network transmission rates and different overall VCPU clock frequencies (allocated by MS; the rest of the parameters are default values). It can be seen that with the increase in network transmission speed and VCPU processing capacity, the offload scheduling delay of all algorithms is decreasing, except for LE, which does not perform task offload at all. For the purpose of MLO, the HEFT algorithm developed specifically for DAG scheduling delay works well. In most cases, its performance is better than some other basic algorithms. It is worth noting that if the network environment is very good and the VCPU is powerful enough, then offloading all tasks is also a good choice.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFigure4shows the average offload scheduling delay at various total VCPU frequencies based on MLO purposes.Then, based on the goal of MUO, the offloading scheduling strategy of DRLOSM is retrained in a standard simulation environment and re-compared with the above-mentioned six basic algorithms.

However, in the actual implementation of security protection, it is not that the more advanced the technical means, the more reasonable and safer the enterprise human resource management system will be. As with any system construction, the economic capacity, rationality, and feasibility of the system need to be considered. When implementing a security protection system, it is necessary to find a balance between investment and profit and implement system security protection in stages.Figure7is the security system diagram of the enterprise human resource management platform.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint(1) System security(a)Access management: According to the enterprise's access control requirements for application characteristics and data resources, the system must provide access management based on visitor role access control.(b)Identity authentication: Ensure that the identity authentication of system users is safe and effective and carefully consider the security authentication mechanism in the enterprise.

The encryption method used by the system to store, send, and process data needs to be clear.(2) Data security(a)User account encryption: Encrypt the user account password so that the plaintext of the password does not appear anywhere. The system encrypts the user password with MD5 to prevent the password from appearing in clear text.(b)Roles and permissions: Strictly control the permissions of ordinary users and do not grant permissions that should not be granted to the user.

"all bottlenecks and restrictive factors that hinder talents from entering the company, deeply implement the spirit of the Central Committee's opinions on deepening the reform of talent development system and other documents, build and establish a modern personnel system in line with the spirit of the times with market and competitiveness, and improve the recruitment, training, evaluation, flow, and incentive mechanism of talents.Secondly, the times are advancing. At present, a company has room for improvement in some business or service innovations [10,11]. For the establishment and development of innovative enterprises, based on innovation systems, equipment and facilities, talents, and relevant incentive mechanisms, it is necessary to formulate long-term plans to provide a good foundation for innovation and growth. Through regular training courses, we will promote and innovate an innovative corporate governance culture that meets the needs of the development of the market economy. In essence, promoting such an invisible code of conduct not only can actively promote the growth of the company but also can promote the long-term development of the company [12]. When discussing the maintenance and construction of corporate culture, enterprise leaders need to pay attention to the following basic requirements: first, corporate culture must deeply reflect the correct core values [13].

"enterprise leaders need to pay attention to the following basic requirements: first, corporate culture must deeply reflect the correct core values [13]. Corporate culture plays an important role in the orderly development of various production and operation activities and the establishment of market rules. Secondly, corporate culture should deeply reflect the unique temperament of the enterprise. Corporate culture is unique and intangible, but it is a very valuable asset [14].Finally, corporate culture must be able to reflect a specific cultural vitality and vitality. Enterprise is the matrix of the corporate culture. They grow together, influence, and promote each other.The survival and development of an enterprise depend directly on the comprehensive quality of its managers to a great extent. For enterprises, it is necessary to establish a good management team for large talent companies to implement all talent management and implementation [15]. Therefore, through the enterprise development strategy and the actual work of the enterprise, the enterprise needs to actively cooperate with the implementation of the quality improvement plan of human resources managers and establish and support the enterprise to form a professional large-scale human resources management department, which can be divided into two methods. One of them is the company's direct recruitment [16]. Through the selection of enterprise recruiters, headhunting recruitment, and recommendation, the management"
"large-scale human resources management department, which can be divided into two methods. One of them is the company's direct recruitment [16]. Through the selection of enterprise recruiters, headhunting recruitment, and recommendation, the management team talents of excellent large-scale human resources companies can directly join the company's management team from the department [17]. This is the most direct process and the most effective management method. Another method is to tap the potential internally. The selection and training within the enterprise improve the skills and quality of the existing employees of the company, so as to achieve the goal of further developing the employee structure. Although this type of management cost is low, the speed is slow, and there may be a significant delay, which requires enterprise decision-makers to make strategic decisions [18,19].In addition, entrepreneurs need to change their way of thinking and concepts, more recognize the special importance of human resources department management, strengthen the organizational leadership of relevant human resources departments, and coordinate various functions so that all aspects of organizations and plans can get the support of the whole society. At the same time, promoting the construction of a sound human resources management system to the enterprise strategic level and improving the overall quality level of human resources are two of the strategic objectives of building a high-quality"

At the same time, promoting the construction of a sound human resources management system to the enterprise strategic level and improving the overall quality level of human resources are two of the strategic objectives of building a high-quality human resources department, so as to lay the foundation for building a high-quality human resources management department.In order to support the company's personnel development, an internal coordination and cooperation mechanism has been established to further strengthen the publicity and promotion of the company's human resources strategic plan within the company so that all functional departments and all employees understand, recognize, and understand the importance of the company's human resources strategic plan and strategic plan. At the same time, establish a reasonable working system and mechanism to provide an institutional guarantee for the smooth implementation of strategic labor planning. In all the processes of human resources strategic planning and implementation, it enables unlimited cooperation between all departments and industries. At the same time, it is necessary to establish a reasonable resource allocation and mechanism to realize the sharing of resources and information between different functional departments and ensure the smooth and effective implementation of strategic planning.Strengthen management participation.

During the implementation of the strategy, the support and recognition of the company's internal management provide a good foundation and guarantee for the implementation of the talent strategic plan at the management, resource, and system levels. When implementing the company's human resources strategy, the cooperation between departments will inevitably bring problems. Relevant executives need to clarify the core content of personnel strategy implementation and effectively promote the sustainability of the strategy through participation in management. Some human resource management, such as detailed incentives and training, clearly require human and other resources. Some companies and management need to pay attention to resource investment and have a solid foundation for implementing a human resource management strategy.In addition to the introduction and popularization of information technology, the construction of enterprise human informatization also needs to continuously and comprehensively monitor and analyze the existing internal data, information, and data. For example, establish performance systems for employees in different departments of the company, use performance indicators to form employee performance information management, establish personnel cost information system, and monitor"
"and data. For example, establish performance systems for employees in different departments of the company, use performance indicators to form employee performance information management, establish personnel cost information system, and monitor specific cost indicators such as recruitment cost and labor cost of the company. Use the information system to enable the relevant data in the process of enterprise talent management to continuously and comprehensively analyze and apply the indicators.Considering the current overall development of the company and the scale of employees, it is difficult to rely on the internal personnel department as the overall responsibility of the personnel strategy in terms of the number and professional scope of the management department It is very limited, which inevitably affects the efficiency of the company's overall human resource management. Therefore, we can give priority to making full use of external third-party specialized agencies to provide support and services for business personnel management and promote the improvement of resource utilization efficiency with the help of outsourcing of large-scale business enterprises.Important work contents that do not include corporate culture or confidentiality, such as service delivery, can be regarded as part of the company's existing human resource management contents and strategy implementation.

"or confidentiality, such as service delivery, can be regarded as part of the company's existing human resource management contents and strategy implementation. Institutions in various business areas are required to fully improve their professional level, retain sufficient practice and energy in the design and implementation of internal management strategy, and ensure the scientificity and coordination of enterprise personnel management strategy. Before cooperating with external service institutions, the company conducted scientific and complete preliminary research and investigation on the scope, organizational structure, and current overall operation and development of external service institutions through objective analysis. Therefore, the selection of appropriate institutions can be determined according to the evaluation and comparison of institutional performance. In addition, firstly, according to the internal workload and work content of the company, the hierarchical structure of the company's personnel outsourcing services should be carried out, then the work allocation and outsourcing agreement should be clarified, and the service outsourcing plan should be formulated, which can reasonably improve the efficiency of resource utilization.4.

The human resource department plays a very important role in this development. The human resource management platform of an enterprise makes use of today's relatively mature computer technology and the needs of human resource management to create a business system that can be integrated with the business field of the enterprise. This paper mainly focuses on the relatively low level of data interaction between the enterprise headquarters and its subsidiaries and the low efficiency of traditional human resource management and describes the design and implementation of the enterprise human resource management platform, which combines the existing hardware and software with the existing human resource management platform; based on the actual situation of twin network and mobile edge computing, we build an enterprise human resource management platform.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis paper was supported by Jiangxi Educational Reform Project: Research on the Incentive Mechanism of University Teachers' Temporary Training in Enterprises, no.

"SummaryBackgroundBurkina Faso has undertaken decentralization reforms in the health care sector to improve the performance of the health system. This study aimed to analyze the differences in health outcomes by health district's demographic and economic status, and the distribution of health resources during the period of health care decentralization.MethodsA bivariate correlation analysis was conducted using data at the health districts and regions level. Data from the health management information system (HMIS) and national households' surveys were used.ResultsThe results indicate a strong correlation between district's population size and the availability of health resources (P≤ .05). The health visits per capita and skilled birth attendance are correlated with the economic status of the health district (P≤ .05). Malnutrition among under-five and maternal mortality was associated with the availability of health personnel and health infrastructures (P≤ .05). No correlation was found between financial resources and health outcomes.ConclusionThe results indicated disparities in health among the health districts in Burkina Faso. The ways to address this inequality include more transparent resource allocation, as well as policies to address the socio-economic disparities and financial barriers to health services. Further research is needed to collect relevant data and investigate the effects of decentralization, which was not possible in our study.1 INTRODUCTIONHealth"
"as policies to address the socio-economic disparities and financial barriers to health services. Further research is needed to collect relevant data and investigate the effects of decentralization, which was not possible in our study.1 INTRODUCTIONHealth inequalities are a major source of social inequity. Several studies and reports have looked at inequality in health care in Africa.1-11Attempts to address health inequalities include initiatives toward universal health coverage. In many developing countries, the aim to establish universal health coverage has led to the revitalization of the public sector and promotion of the private sector through health sector reforms, with the main corollary being the decentralization of health care provision and financing.Regarding health care decentralization, it aims to bridge the gap between providers and users in order to increase health coverage and to achieve better health outcomes through a more equitable distribution of resources and an efficiency in health services provision.12-14However, the rationale for health care decentralization varies across countries. A systematic review of the evidence on the impacts of decentralization on health-related equity found that the main objective for this policy is the improvement of the overall health system performance.15This objective is based upon three key expectations. The first expectation is that decentralization provides the opportunity for health systems to attain both technical and"
"for this policy is the improvement of the overall health system performance.15This objective is based upon three key expectations. The first expectation is that decentralization provides the opportunity for health systems to attain both technical and allocative efficiency, empower local governments, increase accountability, and make gains in areas like quality, cost, and equity. The second expectation is imperative to make health services responsive to local population needs and to improve access and quality of health care. The third expectation is to minimize government expenditure, reduce the role of the state in the provision of health care and to introduce competition and cost-consciousness in the public sector.In 1992, Burkina Faso has undertaken a reform of its health system, which has led to the decentralization of health care.16This resulted in the establishment of health regions, divided into health districts that are the operational level for implementation of the national health policy. The district health services are organized into two levels, the first of which comprises the primary health care centers that provide communities with basic preventive and curative primary health care. The second level consists of district hospitals that represent the point of referral for primary health care centers. District hospitals are managed by a district health management team and are led by a medical officer. The health district funding is largely obtained from the central"
"district hospitals that represent the point of referral for primary health care centers. District hospitals are managed by a district health management team and are led by a medical officer. The health district funding is largely obtained from the central government.As part of the decentralization process, a decision was taken in 2009 by the central government to transfer the health resources and skills to local governments. These local administrative entities (called communes) are run by elected mayors that are autonomous in the management and financing of health resources without any formal hierarchical relation with the health districts. This transfer first involved primary health care centers. An institutional agreement was made to define the roles and responsibilities of each party (central government, local governments, health districts, and primary health care centers). As a result of this agreement, the local governments' roles now include the management of health care centers, procurement and supply of drugs and medical commodities, disease prevention, and sanitation. The central government only plays a regulatory role, which includes defining the national health policy and orientation, setting norms and standards for the health infrastructure, equipment, health services functioning, and management. It also oversees health facilities and allocates financial resources through grants and subsidies to local governments.17It is expected that these reforms will help to"
"for the health infrastructure, equipment, health services functioning, and management. It also oversees health facilities and allocates financial resources through grants and subsidies to local governments.17It is expected that these reforms will help to improve the overall health system performance in terms of better availability and equitable distribution of resources, increased access to good quality health services, as well as better health outcomes across health regions and health districts. It should be noted that these expectations are not solely decentralization-led as some studies15questioned whether decentralization leads to improvement in overall health system performance. A number of these studies report that the outcomes and benefits of decentralization are mixed, the effects of decentralization on health care are negative or ambiguous, and inequity is a major concern.15The aim of this study is to analyze the regional health disparities in Burkina Faso in terms of health districts' demographics, economic status, and distribution of health resources during the period of health care decentralization. The effects of decentralization are, however, out of the scope of our study due to the lack of suitable data. We, therefore, limit our investigation to the analysis of correlations between key regional indicators over time.We apply quantitative analytical methods based on health districts and regions level data in order to explore associations between districts'"
"We, therefore, limit our investigation to the analysis of correlations between key regional indicators over time.We apply quantitative analytical methods based on health districts and regions level data in order to explore associations between districts' demographics and economic profile, health resources, health outcomes, and health status. The analysis is of interest for policymakers in Burkina Faso who attempt to examine the above expectations. The study helps to gauge whether the health care decentralization in Burkina Faso is on a good track to achieve the equality objective and also to provide evidence to the debate surrounding the ultimate aim of health care decentralization, namely, the improvement of service quality and coverage. The analysis is also of interest to other Sub-Saharan African countries that go through a decentralization process to revitalize the public sector while promoting the development of the private sector.2 METHODS2.1 Data collectionTo assess the relationship between health districts' demographic and economic status and health outcomes, we created our own database using district and region level data in Burkina Faso. The data sources are the health management information systems and national households' surveys. These two sources provided the main representative, standardized and updated quantitative data on household's health, demographic and economic status in Burkina Faso.

"households' surveys. These two sources provided the main representative, standardized and updated quantitative data on household's health, demographic and economic status in Burkina Faso. The data sources are described below.2.1.1 Health Management Information System (HMIS) reportsThe HMIS reports are published yearly by the Ministry of Health to release key information and data on the health system functioning and services organization, the health services resources available and the distribution, access, utilization and coverage of health care, as well as health outcomes and health status. These reports are used to evaluate health system performances and health planning. In this study, HMIS reports were reviewed to gather the secondary data by health districts, namely demographic, health sources, health use, and outcomes data.2.1.2 National Household Survey reportsTwo reports published by the National Statistics and Demographic Institute were used to gather secondary data on the economic profile of the 13 administrative regions which also correspond to the territorial breakdown of the 13 health regions covering the 63 health districts. These surveys are representative of the country and they involve large samples of households.The 2010 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) report.

"2010 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) report. This survey included 15 000 households and data were collected using a quantitative method. A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data on household members' characteristics, education level, health services availability and access, use of iodized salt, household's welfare indicators.The 2014 Households Living Conditions Survey report. The sample size of this survey was 10 411 households and data were collected using a quantitative survey method. A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data on household members' characteristics, education level, health, occupation, income, and housing.The data collection points from all sources were 2010 and 2014 to allow for the changes in the socio-economic status, health services access, and health outcomes in health districts during the decentralization period, which started in 2009. The number of health districts was 63 during the period covered in the study. Another rationale for selecting the years 2010 and 2014 was the availability of data on economic characteristics collected through the national household surveys during the same periods.The following main macro indicators were extracted from the sources described above and were used in the study:Demography: health district population estimated by the National Statistics and Demographic InstituteAvailability of health resources:Health personnel per capita: health personnel refers to the sum of the different"

These are physicians, pharmacists, midwives, nurses, and skilled birth attendants from the public sector. This ratio was expressed to 10 000 capita;Health infrastructure per capita: health infrastructure refers to district hospitals and primary health care centers. This ratio was expressed to 10 000 capita;Financial resources: these include funds allocated, funds spent, and the difference between these two;Health care use and outcomes: thenumber of visits to health facilities per capita per year, the percentage of skilled birth attendance, the percentage of malnutrition among under 5, and the maternal mortality ratio.Poverty index and GNI coefficient: Given that the poverty index and the GNI coefficient were not disaggregated to the district level, the profile of each region applied to all the districts in the respective region.These indicators were selected because they are suitable for assessing health disparities/inequities.

"Previous studies have discussed the relevance of these indicators in measuring the geographical difference in health resources, health expenditures, utilization of health services, and health outcomes.18-20Specifically, these indicators provide insight into various dimensions of health inequalities. These were also the only data available in Burkina Faso for a comparison across the regions.2.2 Comparative quantitative analysesData on 1512 observations were compiled using Excel spreadsheets and analyzed with statistical package SPSS version 25 to assess the correlation between the following variables:Demographic and economic characteristics: These characteristics refer to the geographical location (urban or rural), the size of the population, the poverty index, and the GNI coefficient.Availability of resources: The resources refer to the health personnel and health infrastructures.Health outcomes: The health outcomes refer to the visits to health facilities for care-seeking, coverage of selected health services, morbidity, and mortality among vulnerable groups (malnutrition among under-five and maternal mortality ratio).Specifically, we carried out a bivariate correlation analysis to determine, on the one hand, the extent to which health districts' demographic and economic characteristics are associated with the availability of resources, as well as with health outcomes, and, on the other hand, to determine the association between the availability of resources and health"

"System (HMIS) reports.bNational Surveys on Households Leaving Conditions and Poverty.The demographic data indicate a variation in population size across the regions. The regions with most inhabitants are the Centre, Centre Nord, Centre Ouest, Est, Haut Bassins, and Nord regions. The Centre region, which hosts the capital of the country, remains the most populated region.We assumed that the region's economic characteristics (poverty index and GINI coefficient) pertain to all health districts within the region. Therefore, there is no variation in these characteristics within a region (SD = 0). Across the regions, the poverty index varied considerably. In 2010, the five regions with the highest poverty index were the Sahel (49.80%), Sud Ouest (44.00%), Est (42.14%), Centre Nord (22.10%), and Centre Ouest (19.60%). Compared to 2010, poverty was cut nearly in half in 2014 and the five regions with the highest poverty index were the Nord (25.20%), Boucle du Mouhoun (20.40%), Centre Est (13.90%), Est (12.60%), and Plateau Central (12.60%). The only region that remained in the five poorest regions in 2010 as well as in 2014 was the Est region. This region has also been known as the poorest region of the country where the less well-off province is located.21With regard to the GINI coefficient, in 2010, it ranged from 8.80% (Boucle du Mouhoun region) to 21.40% (Hauts Bassins region), and in 2014, from 23.80% (Nord region) to 37.70% (Centre region).

Thus, compared to 2010, the inequality in income indicated by the GINI coefficient was considerably higher in 2014, and it literally doubled and even tripled in some regions (Boucle Mouhoun).

There was an increase in health financial resources allocated to health districts between 2010 and 2014. In 2010, the mean of resources allocated ranged from $570 286 (Centre Est region) to $1 005 200 (Centre region) against $820 627 (Centre Sud region) to $1 295 463 (Centre region) in 2014. For resources spent, the means ranged from $537 143 (Centre Est region) to $970 400 (Centre region) in 2010 and from $751 928 (Centre Sud region) to $1 254 791 (Centre region) in 2014. The Centre Est and the Centre Sud regions, which received the least amount in 2010 and 2014, respectively, had the lowest expenditures. However, the Centre region with the highest amount allocated in 2010 and 2014, registered the highest expenditures in the same period. With regard to differences in resources allocated and resources spent, the region with the lowest difference in 2010 was the Boucle du Mouhoun ($29 333) and the region with the highest difference was the Centre Nord ($126 000).

In 2014, the highest difference between resources allocate and spent, was the Centre Nord region ($83 014) and the lowest difference was in the Sud Ouest region ($21 469).With regard to health personnel availability, the density of health personnel (ratio per 10 000 capita) remained far below the WHO norms set at 23 per 10 000 capita. In 2010, the mean of the health personnel ratio ranged from 4.95 in the Sahel region to 9.68 in the Sud Ouest region. In 2014, the region with the lowest health personnel ratio was still the Sahel (4.96) being one of the rearmost parts of the country, against the Centre Sud region which presented the highest health personnel ratio in 2014 (12.24).The distribution of health infrastructure did not improve during the period. In 2010 and 2014, the Sahel region had the lowest health infrastructure ratio estimated, respectively, at 0.73 and 0.84, while the Centre region with infrastructure ratio of 2.02 and 2.03, ranked first in both years.Overall, as indicated above, health resources were not equally distributed across the regions.

It can be inferred that health services visits are correlated with the availability of health infrastructures and health personnel. The number of visits per capita increases with the increase in the ratio of health personnel and health infrastructure per capita (P< .05). The results also suggest that malnutrition among under-five and maternal mortality decline when the ratio of health personnel and health infrastructure per capita increase (P< .05). No correlation is found between the financial resources and health outcomes.4 DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used secondary regional-level data to analyze the relationship between health districts' demographic and economic status, and health outcomes, using a bivariate correlation analysis. We first determined the correlation between the health district's demographic and economic characteristics, on the one side, and the availability of resources and health outcomes, on the other side. Secondly, we determined the correlation between the availability of resources and health outcomes.The results indicate sizeable variation in the population and poverty index across the regions and a variation in health resources and health outcomes across health districts. While the poverty index declined between 2010 and 2014, the inequality in income between regions has significantly increased during the same period. With regard to"
"regions and a variation in health resources and health outcomes across health districts. While the poverty index declined between 2010 and 2014, the inequality in income between regions has significantly increased during the same period. With regard to health resources, the data suggest inequality in their distribution, that is, urban regions are more privileged than rural regions, which also record poorer health outcomes.The findings show an increase in health financing which is a favorable trend. However, this progress is unequally distributed across health districts highlighting the unfairness in the allocation of health financial resources. Another major finding of our study is the relationship between health resources (personnel and health infrastructures), the population size and the poverty index. This suggests that an increase in poverty and population size is associated with a decrease in health personnel and health infrastructure ratio, thus showing that the poorest and the most populated health districts are less likely to have an optimal level of health personnel and health infrastructure that are key for ensuring adequate health services coverage.This reflects the failure of the health resources allocation policy to distribute health resources in a fair and equal manner across the country, thereby contributing to deepened inequality between urban and rural regions, as well as between well-off and poorest regions.Regional and district disparities were observed"
"to distribute health resources in a fair and equal manner across the country, thereby contributing to deepened inequality between urban and rural regions, as well as between well-off and poorest regions.Regional and district disparities were observed before the start of the health care decentralization as well. A study on the health sector reform in Burkina Faso conducted about two decades ago,22found that there was a strong urban bias to public spending on health, with 70% of funds being directed to the 16% of the population that was urban, leaving 30% for the remaining 84% rural population. Part of the bias in the distribution of financial resources was reflected by the inequitable distribution of human resources, with 57% of physicians, 65% of pharmacists, 55% of midwives, and 47% of nurses being deployed in the two main cities of the country.22Ten years later, another study showed that this situation remained unchanged. Specifically, in a policy note, Zida et al23identified the key issues in resource allocation in Burkina Faso, which were the failure to account for problems encountered by health facilities, the health status of the population, and the existing health system problems. The resources were allocated using a historical allocation key, which did not reflect the programs' performance and the population health's needs, resulting in poor performance of programs, multiplicity of resources allocation methods, poor access to health services, high morbidity, and"
"a historical allocation key, which did not reflect the programs' performance and the population health's needs, resulting in poor performance of programs, multiplicity of resources allocation methods, poor access to health services, high morbidity, and mortality. These findings were similar to the results of a study for Ghana, which suggested that equity in resources allocation should consider the difference between health regions and the difference within the region as well.24Regarding the relationship between health outcomes and the economic performance of the health districts, this study found that a higher poverty rate was associated with less access to health services (health visits, skilled birth attendance decline) and poorer health status (more malnutrition among under five). It was also found that health services visits, malnutrition among under five, and maternal mortality were associated with the availability of health personnel and health infrastructures. The correlation between poverty and health has been widely explored in developing countries, including Burkina Faso, and the economic status was found to be associated with health care access.10,25,26A review on inequalities in health care use and expenditures in eight developing countries and countries in transition revealed that richer groups had a higher probability of obtaining care when sick, to be more likely to be seen by a medical doctor, and to have a higher probability of receiving medicines when ill,"
"in eight developing countries and countries in transition revealed that richer groups had a higher probability of obtaining care when sick, to be more likely to be seen by a medical doctor, and to have a higher probability of receiving medicines when ill, than the poorer groups.5The inequity in malnutrition among under five27and inequalities in infant and under-five mortality28had to do with households' income.There is broad agreement that inequality is unfair, avoidable, and concerns everyone.1,29The causes or drivers of inequality are manifold and its resolution suggests a more in-depth understanding toward equitable access to health services. Previous studies on health sector reform in Burkina Faso showed that the main causes of the unfair distribution of health resources are the over-centralization of resources leading to allocative and technical inefficiencies.22The over-centralization of resources, particularly for investments and staff recruitment, was found to be a barrier to equitable resource allocation at the health district level although the district's managers could have the option to decide over district's health priorities and to readjust resources allocation.30A study for Ghana indicated that equity in the allocation of resources within regions had been virtually ignored, creating a vacuum in knowledge regarding how resources were allocated intra-regionally and their potential influence on promoting health equity.24The resource allocation method was found to"
"of resources within regions had been virtually ignored, creating a vacuum in knowledge regarding how resources were allocated intra-regionally and their potential influence on promoting health equity.24The resource allocation method was found to be the main driver of inequity in resource allocation across geographic areas. The equity of funding allocation was greatly influenced by the availability of human resources for health, local capacity to utilize funds, donor involvement in the health sector, and commitment to promote equity.As mentioned in the introduction, the decentralization of health care was aimed to increase health services provision and access in order to improve equitably the services coverage and population's health status across the health districts and health regions. The study findings show that the equality objective in health was not achieved in the period of health care decentralization in Burkina Faso. In relation to the issue of decentralization and health-related equity, a systematic review found that depending on the context, decentralization could either lead to equity gains or exacerbate inequities.15It can lead to inequities in health financing between sub-national jurisdictions. However, the impact of decentralization on inequities in health and health care depends on pre-existing socio-economic disparities and financial barriers to access.

"impact of decentralization on inequities in health and health care depends on pre-existing socio-economic disparities and financial barriers to access. This suggests that addressing inequality between health districts and health regions would require the reduction of the gap between poor and rich, and the removal of financial barriers that impede equitable access to health services.The selected indicators, although relevant to assess the health disparities, present some limitations because each indicator quantifies a different perspective of inequity. It is therefore imperative to consider how an indicator operationalizes inequities. In particular, it will be advantageous to determine and use a comprehensive set of indicators for a robust assessment of health inequities.20This was not possible in our study because the availability of data comparable across the regions is limited in Burkina Faso.5 STUDY LIMITATIONSThe study used secondary data from the health management information system (HMIS) and national households' survey to carry out a bivariate correlation analysis, which presents four main limitations. First, the health management information system reports are official statistics published by the Ministry of Health that mainly focus on health facilities. They are not able to capture individual-level details relevant to the wider population. Second, the measurement instruments used for the preparation of these reports have changed over time, making it difficult to"
"that mainly focus on health facilities. They are not able to capture individual-level details relevant to the wider population. Second, the measurement instruments used for the preparation of these reports have changed over time, making it difficult to perform a period-to-period comparison, as well as comparison across health regions and health districts. Third, some potential misinterpretation and samples representativeness issues might have occurred given our inability to control data quality and data interpretation. This could interfere with the statistical analysis. Fourth, the aim of the study was not to assess the effects of decentralization on the health system or on health. Therefore, the results should not be referenced as an evaluation of the decentralization impact on health inequality in Burkina Faso.6 CONCLUSIONThrough this study, we explored the relationship between health districts' demographics, economic status, and health outcomes in Burkina Faso. The results indicated demographic and economic differences in health outcomes between health districts, thus showing an inequality in health among health districts. The main underlying causes or drivers of inequality are the economic difference among the population, the health resources allocation policy, and methods that should promote equity among and within the different geographical entities.The study has taken place in the context of decentralization in Burkina Faso, but it did not have the necessary data to"
"the health resources allocation policy, and methods that should promote equity among and within the different geographical entities.The study has taken place in the context of decentralization in Burkina Faso, but it did not have the necessary data to link the results with the direct effect of the decentralization reform. However, it can be noted that the health and health care outcomes changed during the decentralization. Therefore, from a decentralization policy perspective, the findings suggest challenges in addressing the inequality between regions and districts to eliminate the inequality related factors and therefore enhance the equity in health services access, coverage and outcomes. This requires a more transparent resource allocation system based on regions and districts' needs considering the decentralization system, policies to address the socio-economic disparities and financial barriers to health services. A consideration should be given to a health inequality monitoring system to be able to determine the root causes of inequity and identify feasible approaches to address these causes.19Further research is needed to collect relevant data and investigate the effects of decentralization, which was not possible in our study.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe are grateful to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finances for the different reports published.

"AbstractIn order to improve the information and product originality level of intelligent manufacturing industry based on sensor technology, this paper summarizes the current situation of CAx integration based on sensor technology and its design application and analyzes the shortcomings of existing CAx integration, aiming at accurate, complete, timely, and barrier-free transfer of sensor product data and information between CAx system and MRPII/ERP management information system. The concept and information model of feature extension of sensor components oriented to the whole process of sensor intelligent manufacturing is presented. Taking feature extension of sensor components as the integration link, CAx integration framework structure and its design application mode based on feature extension are established, while key technologies and implementation ideas to realize the integration and the design application are put forward, which provides an effective path to realize the sensor integration of CAx and management information systems such as MRPII/ERP.1. IntroductionSensor technology is one of the rapidly developing high and new technologies in today's world. It is also an important symbol of the development of contemporary science.

"science. Together with communication technology and computer technology, sensor technology forms the three pillars of information industry in the 21st century. If a computer is an extension of the human brain, then sensors are an extension of the human features. Therefore, each developed country regards sensor technology as the key technology of this century to try to develop. The application of sensors is also more and more extensive and has penetrated into various professional fields. However, the innovation of sensor technology and the ability of new product development are lagging behind the advanced level at home and abroad, which restricts the development of industrial automation and information technology.The computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS) based on sensor technology is a crucial technology for the informatization of manufacturing industry. CIMS requires fast, lossless, and distortionless communication of product information between computer aided X (CAx) systems and management systems such as manufacturing resource planning (MRPII) and enterprise resource planning (ERP). CAx integration technologies have been studied by researchers for decades, and commercial softwares such as Solidworks and Pro-E, which are typical computer aided design or computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) integration, have been widely used in several industries.

"which are typical computer aided design or computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) integration, have been widely used in several industries. Fruitful research results oriented towards enterprises APPs have been achieved in unified platform integration technology for multisystem and cross-system. However, limitations still exist in these technologies, and integration requirements cannot be fully fulfilled.The most concerning issue for the application of CAx system integration based on sensor technology is the unblocked connection between CAD and other CAx systems [1-3]. Researchers have been made great effort on dealing with this issue, and several integration framework models have been proposed in different cases. CAD system and PDM system integration mode are studied [4]. 3D CAD software SolidWorks 2010 and the small PDM system are designed. CAD, CAPP, and CAM integrated system framework based on PDM is proposed, and the customization content and implementation technology involved in the implementation of the framework are researched in depth [5]. CAx systems are integrated with PDM system by adopting message-driven Hub Spoke integrated mode [6]. A new framework for the design of a CAx information management and integrated system (CAx-IMIS) based on product data management (PDM) techniques and STEP integration technologies is proposed [7]. Seamless integration of CAD/CAE was achieved, and the quality and efficiency of the shell nosing design were improved [8]. A"
"integrated system (CAx-IMIS) based on product data management (PDM) techniques and STEP integration technologies is proposed [7]. Seamless integration of CAD/CAE was achieved, and the quality and efficiency of the shell nosing design were improved [8]. A knowledge-based integration system framework for mechanical product development is obtained [9]. The workflow of virtual modeling and simulation of CAx system is presented, and the design of new bicycle plastic bottle is introduced [10]. The future development and concept for CAx system structure affecting the auto companies and their suppliers are presented [11]. Researchers combined CAD, CAM, and computer-aided process planning (CAPP) with computer software on the product data management (PDM) platform, using the unified control program to realize the extraction, exchange, sharing, and manipulation of the information. This can guarantee not only unblocked information flow within the systems but also effective operation of the systems, thus, realizing the CAx integration goal [12]. Klocke et al. [13] proposed a method of extended function blocks to reduce data loss within adaptive process chains by introducing data port list, which realized the integration of CAx systems. Li et al.

"Li et al. [14] presented a digital collaborative design model and investigated product design process integration technology based on Webservice. A new concept of closed-loop manufacturing process from numerical control machine to CAD/CAM systems based on STEP-NC was put forward [15].To realize information integration in CAD/CAM, they introduced feature recognition technology in CAM programming and established the interaction of data management, manufacturing process management, and enterprise resource planning. Moreover, Ni et al. [16] proposed a heterogeneous system integration framework oriented to enterprise business cooperation and analyzed the key technologies related to the framework, such as ontology modeling, ontology mapping, and semantic interoperability mechanism, which provides a new architecture and method for business cooperation based heterogeneous system integration. A feature technology-based CAx integration system was presented [17-19]. The system realized the integration of subsystems CAD, CAM, and CAPP through the STEP interface and is adapted to product design and process planning of CAD system with different formats. Some researchers also studied ERP/CAx integration based on CORBA, COM/COM+, and JavaRMI component technology and PDM/CAx integration based on ontology/PLM, aiming to realize the connection between CAx and enterprise resource management systems, and support cooperative design.Since the end of 1990s, the application of CAx integration has"
"component technology and PDM/CAx integration based on ontology/PLM, aiming to realize the connection between CAx and enterprise resource management systems, and support cooperative design.Since the end of 1990s, the application of CAx integration has been focusing on enterprise APPs and enterprise knowledge. As a result, the integration application of CAx has gradually developed from the separate application of each unit technology system to the local connection of multiple CAx systems and finally to realize the overall integration [20-22]. In addition, deep learning platforms [23], dynamic system [24,25], and fault diagnosis field [26] may be utilized for the design analysis of sensor parts and integration in engineering. From the previous work, it can be concluded that the existing CAx integration technologies mainly focus on STEP-based, PDM-based, and feature-based integration.Nevertheless, there are still a lot of challenges in establishing the enterprise manufacturing integration system based on CAD/CAM/CAPP to meet the requirements of industrial informalization. First, STEP-based integration pattern use the neutral file to provide CAx systems with a \"intermediate transformation\" or \"intermediate interface,\" which results in the loss of CAD design intention and cannot fully satisfy the integration requirements.

"in the loss of CAD design intention and cannot fully satisfy the integration requirements. Second, PDM-based integration technology only provides a platform for centralized management of product data. When data and information are transmitted between CAx systems through PDM platform, the intrinsic properties of the CAx single system expression will be lost and the integration requirement cannot be fully satisfied. Furthermore, even though the feature-based integration technology can solve the problem of the information exchange and sharing between CAx systems, this is confined within the CAx. Information exchange among subsystems as CAD, CAM, CAPP, and CAFD have to be supported by feature recognition and feature mapping technology. Therefore, the seamless integration of CAx system and management information systems such as CAQ and MRPII/ERP cannot be achieved. Meanwhile, the existing features are intrinsically CAD-based 3D geometries which do not contain the information including manufacturing features, fixture features, quality features, and resource features, thus, limiting the practical application of integration systems.Focusing on the above limitations, this paper has investigated a feature extension technology and its information model thoroughly. Besides, a CAx integration framework based on information extension is established, and key technologies to achieve seamless integration are studied.

"information model thoroughly. Besides, a CAx integration framework based on information extension is established, and key technologies to achieve seamless integration are studied. This work can promote the development of CAx system towards the direction of high integration, networking, virtualization, and intelligence.2. Principle of Feature Extension of Sensor Components and Its Information ModelingGeneral speaking, a feature should be with the multidomain property which includes the design, manufacture, quality, and the resource domain. This property makes the feature a complete knowledge for engineering applications, independent from a specific engineering system. The main idea of the proposed feature extension is to construct a novel type of feature which has merits of independence, completeness, reusability, and revisability. Such type of feature can guarantee the integration of CAx and meet the requirement of feature's property mentioned above.In the next pages of this section, the principles and the information modeling of the proposed feature extension method will be introduced in detail.2.1. Definition and Expression of the Feature Extension of Sensor ComponentsThe feature extension is a geometrical unit which is adaptive to products'/components' lifetime and includes the complete information of products or components.

"adaptive to products'/components' lifetime and includes the complete information of products or components. The complete information (of design, manufacturing, clamping, quality, resource, and management) and its corresponding features are packaged in the feature extension. This property makes the proposed feature extension accessible for different application systems to obtain desired information.According to the basic concept illustrated above, the feature extension can be expressed as a set of a series of features:(1)whereFis the feature extension (i.e., the unit geometrical entity);FDis the design features set in which all design information ofFis packaged, including feature ID, feature name, materials and thermal processing information, technical requirement, and geometrical topology;FMis the manufacturing feature ofF, which is packaged with information concerning manufacturing details, such as manufacturing technologies, tools information, and manufacturing equipment;FFis the fixture features package ofF, where assembling information including orientation, clamping, and guiding;FQis packaged with the quality features ofF, which is consisted of detection planning, detection standard, and detection method, etc.;FEis the resource and management feature set where the resource and management information (resource planning, logistics, delivery schedule, etc.) ofFis packaged.The next, construction of the five features sets will be illustrated in detail.2.1.1. Expression ofFD:"
"resource and management feature set where the resource and management information (resource planning, logistics, delivery schedule, etc.) ofFis packaged.The next, construction of the five features sets will be illustrated in detail.2.1.1. Expression ofFD: A MatrixThe proposed feature extension requires the feasibility of interior features' labeling and matching. To meet such requirement and to make the expression more reasonable for the design features, the design features setFDcan be designed as follows:(2)where eachfXinFDis a column vector withNelements, corresponding toNsamples of the feature extension. Among those,fIDis the label vector indicating the unique identification of theNsamples;fNMis the name vector storing the names of theNsamples;fGMis the geometrical vector, presenting the geometry entity of theNsamples;fSZstores the geometrical size and tolerance of the feature extension;fMRandfTHMare used to store the materials and thermal processing methods, respectively, of theNsamples.It can be concluded from the above statement that the design featureFDhas a form of matrix; each column ofFDindicates the design feature of a certain feature extension.2.1.2.

Expression ofFF: A Logical Rule Based on RelevanceTo comprehensively describe the fixture feature,FFis much easier that other features set since theFFcan be treated as inheritance fromFM. Therefore, theFFpackaged in a feature extension can be designed as a logical variable that indicates whether the feature extension is anFFor not, expressed as:(3)2.1.4. Structure Design ofFQThe quality features setFQincludes the products' or the components' quality planning, quality strategy, detecting method, and detecting planning, etc. Those are tightly related to theFDandFM. All necessary information must be included in theFQso that the CAQ can access required message. Thus, theFQcan be structured into the one presented in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure of the quality feature.2.1.5.

"Packaging of Resource and Management Feature Structure Design ofFEThe resource and management features that setFEare usually determined byFDandFMwhich are tightly relevant to enterprises' management strategies. Therefore, a certain requirement (of a company) for resource management should be packaged in the feature extension. Following this concept, the packaging of the resource and management features can be designed including not only manufacturing but also management details, as is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure of the resource and management feature.2.2. The Information Model of the Feature Extension of Sensor ComponentsThe feature extension proposed as (1) is to improve the design quality in manufacturing and to optimize the management operation of companies. More specifically, a feature extension is an improved type of feature set inherited from its original features. A feature extension extends the concept of \"feature\" by adding new properties (e.g., quality, fixture, and resource) into traditional features set. That means the core of a feature extension is a geometry entity in which all properties required by CAx and MRPII/ERP systems are packaged.Following the discussion above, the information model of the proposed feature extension can be presented as Figures4and5.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe layer structure of the feature extension.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe information model of the feature"
"above, the information model of the proposed feature extension can be presented as Figures4and5.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe layer structure of the feature extension.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe information model of the feature extension.As is shown in Figure4, the proposed feature extension is designed to be a 3-layer structure, including support layer, property layer, and expression layer. The support layer is a set of feature mapping, feature knowledge, and feature rule, controlling the self-organization of the information included in it. As a result, the support layer finally map the design featureFDinto manufacturing, fixture, quality, and resource & management feature, i.e., theFM,FF,FQ, andFE; the mapping constitutes the property layer.Finally, after the mapping processing of the support layer, the expression layer which is presented as a geometry entity, by which the feature extension displays and expresses, is packaged with all properties provided by the property layer, serving the integrated systems with their required information.We can conclude from the above illustration that the feature extension expresses explicitly as a special type of geometry entity which can be treated as an informational entity, serving as a bridge between CAx and other management applications.

Obviously, a feature extension contains the whole features information of products or components indexed.3. Structure Design of the Integrated CAx System Based on the Feature Extension of Sensor ComponentsThe main purpose to the proposed feature extension method is to accordingly establish an integrated platform face to enterprises which combines all the CAx systems, enterprise information management systems, and the work flows of those, together. This platform functions as an information hub system for all specific applications which is with properties of unified portal, feature-leading, and collaborative operation, whose core is the proposed feature extension.The next, we shall illustrate the structure design of the integrated CAx system which is based on the proposed feature extension technology.3.1. Architecture Design of the Application Level for the Integrated System Using Sensor TechnologyThe layers design of the application level of the integrated system is presented in Figure6, which is consisted of four layers: the user interface (UI) layer, the controlling layer, the application integration layer, and the data support layer.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointStructure of the integrated CAx system based on the feature extension.In the following content, the definition of the four layers will be"

The UI LayerThis layer is designed to provide the users with a unified portal which permits users to operate and invoke the integrated CAx system.3.1.2. The Controlling LayerThe main task of this layer is to control the information acquisition from the feature extension of every CAx or MPRII/ERP system in the integrated system. Meanwhile, the controlling layer grants each application authorities of accessing and obtaining the database, according to the logic of operation flow.The controlling layer guarantees the cooperation (between the applications embedded in the integrated system, in the collaborative design stage) of processes, knowledge, and multidisciplinary optimization.3.1.3. The Application Integration LayerThe application integration layer is embedded with CAx systems and other management systems such as MRPII/ERP. In another words, the application integration layer is an integration of applications of CAD modeling, CAPP technology planning, CAFD fixture design, CAQ quality detection and controlling, CAE engineering analysis, and MRPII/ERP enterprise resource management, etc.Among the integrated application described above, the CAD/CAM is in the key technology of the integration design.

"design, CAQ quality detection and controlling, CAE engineering analysis, and MRPII/ERP enterprise resource management, etc.Among the integrated application described above, the CAD/CAM is in the key technology of the integration design. And the feature extension is the central component of this layer since the applications can be embedded in this layer by the different types of information packaged in the feature extension.3.1.4. The Data Support LayerThe data support layer comprehensively manages different types of database (i.e., the extended features database, the feature extension samples database, and the technical knowledge database), so that the data presentation and the upper-layer operation of the feature extension can be supported.3.2. Key Issues in Feature Extension's Realization and Solutions Based on Sensor ComponentsThe previous section has introduced the 4-layer structure of the integrated CAx system proposed in this research. In this section, based on the definition of the feature extension and the structure property of the 4-layer integration, we shall discuss the technical details on how a feature extension matches its corresponding CAD entity and how a combination of feature extensions forms a feature extension sample.3.2.1. The Realization of Feature Extension Based on APIA numbers of commercial CAD softwares, such as Solidworks and Pro-E, provide users with an amount of APIs for secondary developing.

"sample.3.2.1. The Realization of Feature Extension Based on APIA numbers of commercial CAD softwares, such as Solidworks and Pro-E, provide users with an amount of APIs for secondary developing. Since, users can expediently define different feature extension via the APIs during geometry modeling.More specifically, the APIs can be used to package a variety of information (including the design, manufacturing, fixture, quality, and resource and management information) in geometry entity when geometry modeling is carried out. Then, the integrated information and the geometry entity are bundled to be the unified feature extension.The realization of feature extension using APIs demonstrated above has a remarkable merit that users are able to modify the properties packaged in a feature extension according to certain engineering requirements.3.2.2. The Matching between the Feature Extension and the CAD EntityHere, we shall introduce procedure that how to establish the matching between feature extension and CAD entities. The procedure has four steps:Step 1.Obtain features constituting the feature extension from a CAD entity, using feature recognition technology.Step 2.Compare the recognized features in Step1with the default members stored in the feature extension database and calculated the similarities. The member with the largest similarity becomes a candidate solution of the desired feature extension corresponding to the CAD entity.Step 3.Modify the candidate solution obtained in"
"stored in the feature extension database and calculated the similarities. The member with the largest similarity becomes a candidate solution of the desired feature extension corresponding to the CAD entity.Step 3.Modify the candidate solution obtained in Step2to make it the solution for the matching.Step 4.Store the solution of Step3into the feature extension database, so that the database can include more matching examples with the matching procedure kept carrying out.3.2.3. The Assembling of the Feature ExtensionAs is demonstrated before, the feature extension is in fact an extended features set. The feature extension is bundled with a corresponding geometry entity. Thus, the feature extension is expressed as a special geometry entity with other nonconventional features, i.e., a geometry entity with engineering semantics.Different from simply bundling the features, the feature extension is determined by the features matching (as is illustrated in 2); the feature extension replaces the original features of its corresponding CAD model. Then, a novel type of entity model (of component) which is completely consisted with the feature extension solutions is obtained; such entity is embedded with all properties of the component's feature extension, realizing the advantages of CAx-independence and available to the proposed integrated CAx system.Often, a component usually consisted of several structures. Obviously, according to the analysis above, the matching solution of each"
"feature extension, realizing the advantages of CAx-independence and available to the proposed integrated CAx system.Often, a component usually consisted of several structures. Obviously, according to the analysis above, the matching solution of each structure (of the component) needs to be assembled to be a feature extension entity.Generally speaking, the relation between the solutions of a component can be determined by the original CAD model's topology and attachment details of structures. Assume that the component consisted ofngeometrical features andAdenotes the feature relation matrix of the component's CAD model, and the matrixAcan be expressed as(4)whereaijis the relation between the n geometrical features (such as the location and attachment relations). The elements whereaij≠ 0 indicate that featuresaiandajhave certain relations, e.g., geometrical adjacency and form and location tolerance baseline. Whereas the elements whereaij= 0 indicate featuresaiandajare irrelevant.Accordingly, the component expressed by the solutions of feature extension consisted ofnfeature extension solutions. Now, assumeBis the relation matrix of the feature-extension-solution-expressed component, and the relation ofAandBcan be expressed as(5)wherefis a general matrix function.

Design Application Strategy of the Applied Feature ExtensionThe definition and the development designs of the extended feature are two key issues for the integrated CAx system based on feature extension. One practical solution for the key issues mentioned above is to carry out a secondary development on widely-used commercial CAD softwares. This measure can sufficiently make use of the mainstream softwares' advantage and simplify the programming procedure. To solve the secondary development, this research offers an idea, as is concluded as the following four stages.4.1. Define Feature Extension and Establish Extended Feature LibraryThe main task of this stage is classifying and coding the extended feature. Therefore, we can establish the information model for every type of extended feature and further develop a feature extension sample in a commercial CAD system. After that, the extended feature library and the feature extension sample library can be constructed accordingly.4.2. Properties Packaging for the Extended FeaturesNoticing that the commercial CAD software offer abundant geometry modeling methods, other features, such as manufacturing, clamping, quality, and resource information, can be packaged with products' geometry feature.

"modeling methods, other features, such as manufacturing, clamping, quality, and resource information, can be packaged with products' geometry feature. The benefit is that once done, the complete information of products during their lifetime can be generated in the geometry modeling stage.4.3. Transformation from Products' Geometry Model to Feature Extension EntityThe main task of this stage is to construct a matching algorithm that relate the geometry and feature extension entities. This operation guarantees the visible models of products are not only geometry entities but also accessible general information entities for CAx and MRPII/ERP enterprise resource management systems.4.4. Automatic Acquisition of Products' InformationIt is necessary to provide the follow-up procedure with original information of products or components. For example, once the manufacturing information is obtained by the CAPP system, the technology planning can be generated automatically. Therefore, the CAx systems must be able to acquire the information of products or components automatically. One possible solution is to control the work flow and authority of each system.5.

"Second, feature extension properties of sensor components are packaging. Due to abundant geometry modeling methods by offering commercial software, manufacturing, clamping, quality, and resource information can be packaged. Then, the products' geometry model is transformed to feature extension entity based on sensor technology. Finally, sensor products' information is automatic acquisition.The information model and the design application strategy have been studied in detail in this paper, which are constructive to researchers and engineers engaged in advanced manufacturing especially in sensor development. In the next step, we plan to apply the technology proposed in this research to a small-scale enterprise (a university company) to evaluate the performance and to further improve sensor research.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest in this paper.Authors' ContributionsYaohong Tang and Mengmeng Song contributed equally to this work and should be considered co-first authors.AcknowledgmentsThis paper was supported by the following research projects: by the talent introduction project of Ningde Normal University (Grant no. 2019Y16), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant no. 2021J011168 and no. 2020J01432), the Major training project of Ningde Normal University (Grant no. 2020ZDK01), Innovation Team of Ningde Normal University (no. 2020T02), and Engineering Research Center of Mindong Aquatic Product Deep-Processing, Fujian Province"

"AbstractObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of the maternal death review (MDR) system and process in improving quality of maternal and newborn health care in northern Nigeria.MethodsA combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used, including review of MDR forms and of health management information system data on maternal deaths (MDs), as well as semi-structured interviews with members of 11 MDR committees.ResultsFacility-based MDRs were initiated in 75 emergency obstetric and newborn care facilities in northern Nigeria and were initially conducted in the 33 hospitals; however, the process stopped after some time and had to be revitalized. Main reasons were transfer of key members of MDR committees, lack of supportive supervision, and shortage of staff. Ninety-three (12.1%) of 768 identified MDs were recorded on MDR forms and 52 (6.7%) had been reviewed. MDRs resulted in improved quality of care, including mobilization of additional resources. Challenges were fear of blame, shortage of staff, transfer of MDR team members, inadequate supportive supervision, and poor record keeping.ConclusionMDR requires teamwork, commitment, and champions at health facility level to spearhead the process. MDR needs to be institutionalized in the Ministry of Health, which provides oversight, policy guidance, and support, including supportive supervision.1 IntroductionAchievement of the Millennium Development Goal related to maternal health requires not only increasing coverage"
"in the Ministry of Health, which provides oversight, policy guidance, and support, including supportive supervision.1 IntroductionAchievement of the Millennium Development Goal related to maternal health requires not only increasing coverage and access of key interventions but also improvement of quality of care (QoC)[1]. Review of maternal deaths (MDs) in health facilities, also sometimes called maternal death audit, assists in identifying important QoC problems. In addition to identifying obstetric causes, these maternal death reviews (MDRs) shed light on why women are dying by identifying contributing--and often avoidable--factors and help to discover important shortcomings in care and weaknesses in organization and provision of health services[2]. WHO recommends that health facilities providing obstetric care should review their maternal and perinatal deaths, and initiate action to address the identified problems. Facility-based MDR is defined as a \"qualitative, in-depth investigation of the causes of and circumstances surrounding MDs occurring at health facilities\"[3]. The main purposes of MDR are to answer the question \"why did this woman die?,\" to initiate action to solve identified problems, to improve QoC, and to save lives in the future. For those taking part, it is a valuable learning experience and each death tells an important story of what went wrong and what could have been done better. Facility-based MDR usually does not provide information on what happened"
"save lives in the future. For those taking part, it is a valuable learning experience and each death tells an important story of what went wrong and what could have been done better. Facility-based MDR usually does not provide information on what happened before the woman reached the health facility, unless relatives or carers at community level are interviewed. The main principles of MDR are to maintain anonymity, confidentiality, and a non-threatening environment without accusing or blaming people, and commitment to act. Its main purpose is identifying, analyzing, and solving problems, rather than punishing people. For the steps in initiating and conducting MDR, we refer to the WHO publicationBeyond the Numbers:Reviewing Maternal Deaths and Complications to Make Pregnancy Safer[3]. Other methods used to improve quality of maternal and newborn health (MNH) are perinatal death review (PNDR)[4], near-miss review[5,6], criterion-based audit[7,8], and confidential enquiries into maternal and perinatal deaths[9,10].Since 2010, the Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria - Maternal Newborn and Child Health (PRRINN-MNCH) program has initiated facility-based MDR in emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) facilities in Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara states in northern Nigeria as part of a wider continuous quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve quality of MNCH services.

"facilities in Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara states in northern Nigeria as part of a wider continuous quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve quality of MNCH services. At each health facility, multidisciplinary QI teams review identified MDs after the chairperson--who is the champion of the MDR process--has collected all of the information, including patient records and additional data from interviews with health workers who were involved in the cases. The three-delays model developed by Thaddeus and Maine is used as an analytic framework for analyzing the contributing factors[11]. Mentoring support is given to the QI teams through supportive supervision, which the program supports and tries to strengthen in the states. At additional quarterly meetings at local government area (LGA) level (the Nigerian equivalent of a district), QI teams present and discuss some of their MDs and share experiences with MDR. To build capacity in the states to establish QI initiatives, including MDR and PNDR, selected doctors and midwives with experience in QI and MDR have been trained as trainers and supportive supervisors. In an interstate workshop, tools for MDR recording and reporting have been developed. These include a recording form, a notification form, a follow-up form, and a staff interview guide. A guideline was developed on how to complete the forms. The forms were approved by the State Ministries of Health. (Interested readers can request electronic copies of the forms via"
"form, a notification form, a follow-up form, and a staff interview guide. A guideline was developed on how to complete the forms. The forms were approved by the State Ministries of Health. (Interested readers can request electronic copies of the forms via E-mail to the corresponding author.)Between July 2010 and early 2013, MDR had been initiated in 75 EmONC facilities (25 in each state), of which 31 are general hospitals, two are secondary specialist referral hospitals (federal medical centers), and 42 are primary healthcare (PHC) centers, which had been upgraded to basic EmONC (BEmONC) facilities. In July 2011, a preliminary rapid assessment of the MDR process was conducted in Zamfara and Katsina states. Because of the precarious security situation, this was not possible in Yobe state. Two years later, the present more in-depth evaluation of the MDR process was carried out. The aim of the present study was to review the MDR system and process in EmONC health facilities and to evaluate its effectiveness in improving quality of MNH care. The analysis of the causes and contributing factors of the reviewed MD cases, which was part of the evaluation, will be reported in another paper.2 Materials and methodsThe present evaluation, which was conducted by a national consultant in obstetrics between March 19 and April 30, 2013, used a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods.

"evaluation, which was conducted by a national consultant in obstetrics between March 19 and April 30, 2013, used a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative methods included review of available forms for MDR recording and reporting, and data of reported MDs through the health management information system (HMIS). Qualitative evaluation methods included semi-structured interviews with members of the MDR teams, who provided informed consent for the interviews. Three PRRINN-MNCH-supported LGAs were randomly selected from each state, and one BEmONC and one comprehensive EmONC (CEmONC) facility were randomly selected from the list of EmONC facilities in each selected LGA. A total of 18 facilities were visited and interviews were conducted with 11 MDR teams from nine CEmONC and two BEmONC facilities. The other seven BEmONC facilities were PHC centers that had not experienced any MDs. Ethics approval was not required for the present study, which was requested by the PRRINN-MNCH program.Quantitative information was entered into a data extraction form and analyzed using SPSS version 18 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). In-depth interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic framework.3 ResultsAll available forms for MDR recording and reporting since the introduction of MDR were retrieved from all 75 EmONC facilities by program staff.

"framework.3 ResultsAll available forms for MDR recording and reporting since the introduction of MDR were retrieved from all 75 EmONC facilities by program staff. The numbers of available forms are presented inTable 1. Ninety-three cases of MD had been reviewed.Table 2shows the distribution of cases per state. For 10 cases, all three forms were available; for 31 cases, only the copy of the notification form was available, which meant that no MDR had been conducted because there were no recording forms. Twenty-nine of the 52 recording forms were fully completed and so were all 41 notification forms and 10 follow-up forms. Eleven recording forms had no written action plan; of the 41 action plans, only 10 follow-up forms were available. For the same period, 768 MDs had been reported from the same facilities through the state HMIS. Thus, only 93 (12.1%) HMIS-reported MDs had been recorded on MDR forms and only 52 (6.7%) MDs had actually been reviewed.Table 1.Availability of MDR forms for analysis.aForms for MD recordingForms for MD notificationForms for MD follow-upTotal54b(51.5)41 (39.0)10 (9.5)105 (100.0)Abbreviations: MD, maternal death; MDR, maternal death review.aValues are given as number (percentage).bTwo of the 54 recording forms were excluded from the analysis because they were used as referral forms.Table 2.Distribution of reported MDs per state through routine HMIS and the MDR system.Through routine HMISThrough MDR systemaKatsina47553 (11.2)Yobe8214 (17)Zamfara21126"

Seven PHC centers designated as BEmONC facilities were visited but had not experienced any MDs.Most MDR committees included representatives of relevant departments (e.g. maternity, laboratory/blood bank, pharmacy, operating theater, prenatal clinic), as well as the chief nursing officer, the hospital secretary, the medical records officer, a midwife, and a doctor (usually the chairperson). The usual frequency of MDR meetings was monthly; two hospitals had quarterly meetings. In all visited hospitals, MDRs stopped at some point and most restarted in October 2012, after revitalization of the process by PRRINN-MNCH staff. Transfer of key members of the MDR committees was the main reason given for the discontinuation of MDR, together with lack of supportive supervision and shortage of professional staff for the high workload.

"members of the MDR committees was the main reason given for the discontinuation of MDR, together with lack of supportive supervision and shortage of professional staff for the high workload. All hospitals had received supportive supervision by staff from the PRRINN-MNCH program once or twice, but not from the State Ministry of Health.All of the people interviewed could recall some actions undertaken and completed, based on the MDRs. These included organizing on-the-job training related to identified problems such as poor use of the partograph; requesting necessary resources from hospital management or the State Ministry of Health (e.g. more skilled staff or equipment); establishment of cupboards with emergency drugs in the labor ward and mechanisms to ensure availability; redistribution of staff such as midwives from other wards to the labor ward; conducting voluntary blood donation campaigns to improve availability of blood in the blood bank; health education in the community on danger signs of pregnancy to improve health-seeking behavior and reduce late presentation; and strengthening the emergency referral system by involving local drivers and having their phone numbers.When asked about successes and achievements, all respondents were enthusiastic about the MDR process and provided much positive feedback. Maternal death review has initiated improvements in QoC. The most frequently mentioned success was better management of patients. Another achievement was mobilization of"
