"the timestamp ensures the automatic and orderly connection of chronological blocks, rather than the idle arrangement in the database. Secondly, timestamp is an auxiliary tool for information query, which can save a lot of time. It is very convenient to query all information before and after, saving a lot of manpower and material resources. Finally, the timestamp guarantees the authenticity of the data. With the help of timestamps, the continuity of data generation can be well reflected. Once the information is maliciously deleted and tampered with, the node can be found in time, thereby further improving the authenticity, accuracy, and security of the data on the chain. The operating mechanism of the blockchain enables it to effectively resist malicious attacks [5]. Selective encryption and other specific data transmission volume are nodes on the open-source chain, and nodes can query the development and use of real-time data chains and related applications [6,7].The blockchain is composed of blocks connected to each other in time, and each block is also composed of fixed components. A block generally consists of data information, a timestamp, a hash value, a random number, and information about the previous block. Piece and blocks, as the basic unit of the blockchain, are both the structural elements of the system and the information carrier of the shared database [8,9]. If the blockchain is likened to a large ledger, then the block is every page of this large ledger. It"
"and blocks, as the basic unit of the blockchain, are both the structural elements of the system and the information carrier of the shared database [8,9]. If the blockchain is likened to a large ledger, then the block is every page of this large ledger. It not only records the time, address, and content of the current transaction but also stores all data before the point in time in a fixed location in an inherent form, which is the basis for supporting queries, traceability, and other functions. In a broad sense, timestamp is to provide time proof for each transaction to verify the authenticity of transaction data; narrowly speaking, timestamp is an important part of block metadata and naturally has time characteristics. In a sense, blockchain can be understood as building a never-ending, indestructible timestamp system [10,11].Blockchain technology serves customers by facilitating the tracking and tracing of all stages of order production through delivery and quick adjustments. The applications brought about by blockchain technology can only be implemented at specific touch points in the network if accepted by the relevant parties, thus controlling the data security of all supply chain transactions.Its main operation mechanism is as follows: first, obtain a piece of data information in the system; then, operate it automatically through a hash algorithm; and finally, convert it into a fixed-length irreversible output hash [12]. Because the process is irreversible, the"
"mechanism is as follows: first, obtain a piece of data information in the system; then, operate it automatically through a hash algorithm; and finally, convert it into a fixed-length irreversible output hash [12]. Because the process is irreversible, the original data cannot be calculated from the output information, and the security of the data information is protected to the greatest extent. In addition, any change in the bytes results in a huge difference in the output hash, which provides a simple and fast way for nodes to verify the authenticity of the data. Random numbers are one of the most critical data items in a block [13,14]. It requires accountants to continue their efforts. Although there are many valid numbers, the answer is hard to come by. There are no fixed algorithms or shortcuts. The only way is to keep trying. Therefore, people call this process \"mining.\" The process of \"mining\" is also irreversible, but its verification process is simple and provides another technical guarantee for data security [15]. In the previous piece of information, in the blockchain, each block not only contains all the transaction information in the current time period but also cleverly compresses the previous transaction information and saves it in each block to ensure that each transaction can be traced back quickly to the source. In addition, the previous transaction records are also compressed and stored in the hash value, which saves a lot of storage space for the database"
"and saves it in each block to ensure that each transaction can be traced back quickly to the source. In addition, the previous transaction records are also compressed and stored in the hash value, which saves a lot of storage space for the database [16]. In the computer system, first, the system does not rely on a central server for operation, and the interests of members come from the participation of other members; second, the rights and obligations of system members are equal, taking into account the client and the server; make up real or virtual groups, and know each other's existence. First is decentralization. The resources and services in the system are scattered on each node, and each node has the right to use and consume equally. Through the cooperation between the nodes, the content transmission and service sharing between the nodes can be realized directly, which avoids the possible centralized management bottleneck; second is scalability [17,18]. With the development of hardware technology and the rapid growth of computer storage capacity and network bandwidth, P2P can effectively use a large number of node resources scattered in the network and allocate value exchange, information exchange, or data storage to all nodes. On the whole, the blockchain is actually a decentralized data storage structure constructed by a P2P network.2.2.

"to all nodes. On the whole, the blockchain is actually a decentralized data storage structure constructed by a P2P network.2.2. Urban GovernanceThe application of information technology has given birth to the new urban concept of \"smart city.\" In the governance of smart city, the collaborative governance model of multiparticipation is difficult to effectively coordinate the relationship between the participating subjects, resulting in the dilemma of urban governance. It is particularly necessary to introduce blockchain technology in urban governance. Blockchain technology helps to establish a trust mechanism between urban governance entities. On the one hand, it clarifies the rights and responsibilities of people and things in the city, reduces the cost of urban governance, and on the other hand promotes the efficiency of urban governance.Each node of the blockchain has a copy of all the data of the system. Once the data is updated, the information will be quickly copied to each block to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data information. Encryption technology is the core technology to ensure the security of data and information, and it is an active and effective means of security. Use mathematical algorithms to encrypt the information and convert the information into ciphertext. The ciphertext cannot be pushed back to prevent illegal users from stealing the user's original data and maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. According to different key"
"encrypt the information and convert the information into ciphertext. The ciphertext cannot be pushed back to prevent illegal users from stealing the user's original data and maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. According to different key algorithms, encryption technologies can be divided into two categories: symmetric encryption technology and asymmetric encryption technology. Among them, symmetric encryption uses only one key for encryption and decryption. Once the private key of any party is disclosed, the entire communication content will be decrypted. Asymmetric encryption uses key pairs, one for encryption and the other for decryption [19]. Unlike symmetric encryption, keys need to be synchronized first. In contrast, the security of symmetric encryption depends only on the key itself. The private key can explain the information carried by the public key and important privacy information of the node user. Once the private key is lost, its owner may lose all resources, resulting in huge losses. The content of synergy theory mainly includes the following three aspects: (1) synergy: synergy is the result of synergy. In an open and complex system, a large number of subsystems interact to produce an overall effect that cannot be achieved by the individual, thereby better coping with the complex external environment and improving the overall flexibility of the system. (2) Servo principle: in other words, fast variables are subject to slow variables--the"
"effect that cannot be achieved by the individual, thereby better coping with the complex external environment and improving the overall flexibility of the system. (2) Servo principle: in other words, fast variables are subject to slow variables--the cooperation speed and effectiveness of the entire system are constrained by the slowest variables in the entire system. Similar to the bucket principle, the \"short board\" in the system will ultimately determine the benefits of each component. (3) The principle of self-organization: self-organization is relative to other organizations. Other organizations refer to the external effects caused by organizational changes, while self-organization refers to the spontaneous changes between internal subsystems to form a synergistic effect. Therefore, it has a new structure and function to better respond to the new environment and maximize organizational development.It has the following characteristics: common goals. There are two main reasons for the synergy of the system: first, changes in the external environment force the system to adjust for survival or development; on the other hand, in order to better survive or develop the system through the coordination between the various subsystems and the sufficient resources, reasonable configuration enhances the overall adaptability of the system and produces synergistic effects. But the premise is that the relevant subsystems are internally adjusted under the same goal. Consistent goals make"
"and the sufficient resources, reasonable configuration enhances the overall adaptability of the system and produces synergistic effects. But the premise is that the relevant subsystems are internally adjusted under the same goal. Consistent goals make each part have a clear direction and upgrade in a coordinated and unified manner. In the production process of the new structure, the weakest regulating variable plays a decisive role in system synergy, so the synergy process is a process of overall change. Significant component changes will not result in overall optimization and upgrades. Therefore, we cannot ignore the overall coordinated development, because we pay too much attention to the individual and the relationship between the parts is very close. Through mutual communication and joint adjustment, we can eliminate the \"barrel\" effect to the greatest extent and improve the overall advantage of the system. For spontaneity, regardless of the external factors or the coordination caused by internal factors, they are systemic spontaneous adjustments and cannot be forcibly interfered by the outside world. Only spontaneous adjustments can make their development more stable and durable, and the consistency of goals can be further consolidated. The new structure, new features, and new functions of the system produced by the cooperation of various subsystems cannot be achieved through the self-improvement of the subsystems, which is also one of the important reasons for the"

The new structure, new features, and new functions of the system produced by the cooperation of various subsystems cannot be achieved through the self-improvement of the subsystems, which is also one of the important reasons for the overall cooperation of the selection system. A business language is recognized by a computer [20]. It can be seen that it has three main characteristics: one is that the form of content transmission is recognized and standardized; the second is that electronic data exchange enables data transmission between electronic devices; and the third is that information is transmitted using computer-recognizable languages. At present, electronic data interchange has been widely used in various aspects of real life, such as data transfer between international trade, transfer of packing slips and bills of lading in international shipping, etc., to achieve \"paperless trade\" [21,22].It is not difficult to see that electronic data exchange has played an important role in reducing the error rate, shortening order processing and delivery time, and reducing enterprise inventory [23]. However, in view of the huge changes in the current market environment, electronic data exchange technology still has certain shortcomings in the following aspects: first, electronic data security.

"still has certain shortcomings in the following aspects: first, electronic data security. With the rapid development of network information technology, malicious information technologies and software such as hackers and viruses are also increasing. On the basis of paperless transactions, data security is becoming increasingly important. However, there are no relevant defense measures in the electronic data exchange technology, which poses a great threat to the data security in the system and also brings many uncertain factors to the effective operation of the information collaboration system. Second, it does not completely require manual processing [24]. Although this technology does not rely on paper documents to a certain extent, the goal of collaborative information management is to achieve completely electronic document processing [25]. Only fully electronic document data can ensure that the transaction process is not disturbed by human factors, minimize the probability of errors, and maximize transaction efficiency [26]. Third, the cost is high. Because electronic data exchange requires the use of recognized data transmission standards, the data exchange system must be used uniformly, otherwise real-time data transmission cannot be achieved.

"cannot be achieved. However, for the supply chain of SMEs, due to weak capital strength, weak technical capabilities, and other reasons, the establishment of the system will lead to a reduction in their working capital, reduce their ability to respond to emergencies, and increase their ability to operate risk impacts. For the information on synergies in the supply chain, from data collection, processing, and analysis to data use, the initiative is in the hands of core companies, and the use rights of other supply chain companies are greatly restricted. Therefore, this model cannot meet the needs of modern supply chains, and there are many problems to be solved. First, centralized management will cause a large number of data resources to be idle. The supply chain includes not only supply and manufacturing but also various companies such as logistics and sales. Therefore, the information resources in the supply chain database are complex and diverse. The supply chain database is a data network that can meet the decision-making needs of various enterprises, but centralized control agencies make it impossible for noncore enterprises to effectively assist the operation and information resources of the enterprise, resulting in the second highest utilization of information and centralized management to reduce the degree of visualization [11,27].2.3.

Information ManagementThe realization of supply chain information coordination is based on fast and reliable information flow. The degree of visualization directly affects the quality of the information flow. However, restrictions on access rights, nondisclosure of data, and deliberate concealment will seriously hinder the transparency of the operation process and affect the scientificity and accuracy of supply chain companies' decisions. Finally, nondisclosure of information will further cause the problem of uneven distribution of benefits, threaten the trust foundation of supply chain companies, seriously dampen the enthusiasm of supply chain companies for cooperation, and then affect the effectiveness of supply chain coordination. The cooperation of production information mainly refers to the process guidance and improvement of the production process and the supply chain that improves production efficiency, reduces the friction coefficient in the production process, accelerates the seamless connection speed of each link, reduces production delays, and improves product quality.

This is also a key link that determines the long-term development of the supply chain. From different dimensions, blockchain classification can get different blockchain classifications. This article divides the blockchain into permission chains and nonpermission chains based on whether the connection of the nodes requires permission from other members. The license chain consists of a public license chain and a private license chain, sometimes called the alliance chain. Member nodes in the alliance chain need to get permission from other members in the alliance to join. Members in the alliance chain understand each other's identities, and their consensus is participated by the alliance members. Data read and write permissions are established in accordance with alliance rules. Sometimes, the private permission chain is also called the private chain, which is applicable to the internal system of the unit or organization. The read and write permissions of data are controlled by the organization, so it cannot completely solve the problem of appointment letters. The unlicensed chain is also known as the public chain.

"solve the problem of appointment letters. The unlicensed chain is also known as the public chain. Any organization or individual is free to join or withdraw from the blockchain system, and system members can participate in negotiations and have read and write permissions to the data.Several key data structures and cryptographic algorithms are used in the data layer to ensure that the recorded data cannot be tampered with. The network layer defines the network structure, message protocol, and verification mechanism of the blockchain system. The consensus layer defines how distributed nodes agree on the content of block data. The incentive layer rewards the nodes that contribute to the blockchain system, so that most nodes maintain integrity in the system for the purpose of maximizing their own interests. The contract layer provides developers with a variety of scripts for their use. Some blockchain systems also provide Turing's complete development language and running language virtual machines. On these virtual machines, a variety of smart contract applications can be implemented. The application layer is based on the layers below it and leverages the advantages of the blockchain to provide a variety of decentralized application services. Blockchain technology is a series of mature or emerging technologies.

"application services. Blockchain technology is a series of mature or emerging technologies. Under the effective and reasonable use of various technologies, it provides a secure and stable operating environment for the blockchain network. The blockchain technology model is divided into six layers: application layer, contract layer, incentive layer, consensus layer, network layer, and data layer. Among them, the consensus layer, network layer, and data layer are the three core layers necessary for a blockchain network and are the basis for ensuring the normal operation of the blockchain network. The related technologies used in these three layers also provide new solutions for the development of information security technology for the Internet of Things. These consensus algorithms for public chains have problems such as large resource consumption and low efficiency. Although they have high fault tolerance and strong antiattack capabilities, they sacrifice certain availability and are not suitable for IoT environments with high real-time requirements.Blockchain is a low-level technology for solving credit problems. From a technical perspective, the blockchain is a decentralized, distributed database.

"environment maintains an independent state, and the destruction of a few nodes will not affect the operation of the entire system. For enlightenment from theoretical thinking, in order to obtain decentralization and equal information status in the Internet era, technical experts and scholars have made great achievements in information equality theory. The development of this theory greatly encouraged later scientists and computer experts to explore a decentralized currency, which provided theoretical guidance for the struggle for equal power. The development and maturity of technology are also a necessary condition for the creation of blockchain. The emergence of cryptography, the gradual improvement of algorithms, and the introduction of computer computing capabilities and distributed concepts have made great contributions to the development of blockchain. Interaction in a broad sense refers to the communication and interaction between all things. It can be the interaction between people, people and things, and things and things, but it is not limited to the use of language, senses, expressions, touch, etc. to generate a certain relationship.3.

The \"wisdom\" of a city mainly comes from data collection, processing, analysis, and application supported by technology. The \"governance\" of a city emphasizes multiparty participation and win-win cooperation, and the ultimate goal of governance is to serve the overall interests of urban residents. Therefore, the governance of a smart city means that different actors in the city use data, experience, and knowledge to make logical inferences and rational thinking and use these inferences and thinking in the practice process of urban decision-making and behavioral norms.3.1.

At present, more and more countries and enterprises have realized the importance of information design, and at the same time, they have also spawned professional companies that provide information design services, and universities have begun to pay attention to this new profession. Scholar Song Jidong believes that interactive information visualization can not only make complex information easier to understand but also make it easier for users to acquire knowledge. Interaction design is mainly to improve the user's understanding ability, increase the interest in information acquisition, and reduce the user's learning cost. Information visualization is mainly to help users understand the information, make the information more intuitive and easy to obtain, and attract users' attention.

"as a design method is more suitable as the first step in the design practice of popular science exhibition halls. The first step is to gather a large number of requirements. The second step is to remove the coarse and fine, to define the product functions more clearly, to lock the user's goals and needs, and to further subdivide the product. For scalability, the network can increase or decrease nodes arbitrarily, and the status of the newly added nodes is consistent with the status of other nodes. For fault tolerance, downtime and restart of any node in the network will not affect the propagation of the message; for decentralization, no central node is required, all nodes are equal, and no node needs to know the status of the entire network; as long as the network is connected, any node can propagate the message to the entire network; for consensus convergence: there is no guarantee that all nodes will receive the message at a certain time, but the message will propagate rapidly in the network at an exponential speed.4. Detailed Description4.1. Blockchain-Related Analysis4.1.1. Gas Required for Digital Identity ManagementAccording to the statistical analysis of the data, as shown in Figure1, Gas is the \"workload\" required to measure an action or a group of actions and is a unit of measure for transaction costs.

"to measure an action or a group of actions and is a unit of measure for transaction costs. Gas exists inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine as a count of computational workload. On the one hand, it serves as a reward for miners to package blocks, and on the other hand, it raises the threshold for malicious transactions and maintains the normal operation of the Ethereum network. The costs of creating a smart contract or performing a function in a smart contract include contract execution costs and transaction costs. Under this framework, the registration of an autonomous identity is to create a digital identity agency contract DIPC, a digital identity storage contract CD, a digital identity verification contract IAC, a digital identity restoration contract IRC, and a digital information verification contract IVC in the digital identity management contract DIMC. Digital identity authentication (login) is called IAC contract; digital identity and related information authentication uses IVC protocol; digital identity authorization is called optical disc contract; digital identity retrieval is related to IRC contract. Taking digital identity registration as an example, users need to consume about 360 Gas to obtain an autonomous digital identity. The management cost of autonomous digital identity is low, making the application of this framework possible.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointGas for digital identity management.4.1.2. Analysis of Attack NodesAccording to the"
"digital identity. The management cost of autonomous digital identity is low, making the application of this framework possible.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointGas for digital identity management.4.1.2. Analysis of Attack NodesAccording to the statistical analysis of the data, the probability of the attacking node successfully tampering with the block data, where the ordinate is the tamper probability and the abscissa is time, is shown in Figure2and Table1. After a period of time, the probability of successful attack is close to 66%. Then, the rewards it receives as an honest node far outweigh the benefits of tampering with the data. In theory, all nodes will eventually receive the message, so this is a final consensus protocol. The negotiation layer is the core of the blockchain system, and the negotiation algorithm is the essence of the blockchain. The negotiation algorithm, also known as the consensus mechanism, is essentially a solution. When an inconsistency occurs in a distributed system, a unique and universally recognized result is determined through it to resolve the inconsistency. The consensus algorithm is to determine the distributed ledger accounting process among the nodes in the blockchain system according to the prenegotiated rules, so that different nodes agree on the transaction data, thereby ensuring the consistency and authenticity of the distributed ledger.

Analysis of Information Management System4.2.1. Delay AlgorithmAccording to the statistical analysis of the data, as shown in Figure3, when using the consensus delay algorithm, that is, the algorithm consensus nodes before 200 years, in idle time, in general, all nodes elect the master node to lead a consensus: proposal: select the master node responsible for the new block; validation: other nodes are responsible for validating the proposed block. If most nodes pass the verification, the proposed block can be updated to the main chain; uplink: all nodes add new blocks to the main chain to complete a complete consensus process.

"encryption technology is the most basic security technology and is known as the core of information security. It was originally mainly used to ensure the confidentiality of data during storage and transmission. Once the digital encryption technology is destroyed, the data security in the blockchain will be challenged, and its antitampering functions will no longer exist. Digital encryption technology uses cryptographic algorithms to solve data security problems. It replaces the protected information into ciphertext through various methods such as transformation and replacement and then stores or transmits the information. Even if the encrypted information is obtained by unauthorized persons during the storage or transmission process, it can also ensure that the information is not cognition, so as to achieve the purpose of protecting information. The confidentiality of this method depends directly on the cryptographic algorithm and key length used. There are two encryption algorithms, one is symmetric encryption algorithm; the application is earlier, and the technology is mature. The characteristics of the symmetric encryption algorithm are that the algorithm is open, the calculation amount is small, the encryption speed is fast, and the encryption efficiency is high. The second is the asymmetric encryption algorithm. The asymmetric encryption algorithm is used.

"fast, and the encryption efficiency is high. The second is the asymmetric encryption algorithm. The asymmetric encryption algorithm is used. Before the communication between the sender and the receiver, the receiver must send the public key that has been randomly generated to the sender and keep the private key. Since asymmetric algorithms have two keys, they are particularly suitable for data encryption in distributed systems. With the advent of the era of big data, data, as a valuable resource with huge potential, has attracted more and more attention. In addition, a large amount of data is closely related to user behavior, which makes users pay more and more attention to the privacy protection of their data. But at present, data is still in the hands of so-called industry giants, whether in traditional areas such as digital identity or healthcare.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointDelay algorithm.4.2.2. Implementation Effect AnalysisAccording to the statistical analysis of the data, as shown in Figure4, the willingness of the blockchain is to replace the current infrastructure (for example, like the back-end systems of many financial institutions in the world, it can process thousands of transactions per second), Because the blockchain integrates a number of basic technologies such as distributed accounting, nontampering, and smart contracts, it has built a mechanism for establishing trust at a lower cost, which can play a huge role in many business scenarios,"
"Because the blockchain integrates a number of basic technologies such as distributed accounting, nontampering, and smart contracts, it has built a mechanism for establishing trust at a lower cost, which can play a huge role in many business scenarios, especially in the financial field. Therefore, there is no doubt that blockchain has the potential to become a new generation of infrastructure. For transaction throughput, the higher the volume, the more interesting the blockchain technology is. As the number of nonlicensed chain nodes deployed for each virtual server increases, its throughput decreases due to hardware limitations. Since each account sends transaction blocks asynchronously to other unrelated accounts, it does not need to wait for merchants to pack like traditional blockchains do. Analyze, utilize, and even tamper with data without the user's knowledge. With the advent of blockchain technology, its inherent transparency, credibility, tamper resistance, traceability, and high reliability have opened up new ideas for data confirmation and storage and protection of data privacy. In the use of blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the original data, the lack of market liquidity of data assets can be converted into certificates, which can be freely traded in the financial market through commoditized method data, which makes the value of user data resources tend.

"assets can be converted into certificates, which can be freely traded in the financial market through commoditized method data, which makes the value of user data resources tend. However, some scholars believe that the real realization of blockchain in supply chain applications is inseparable from the mutual trust between enterprises. Only in this way can an effective consensus foundation be formed and the ability to cooperate with each other and the operation efficiency of the supply chain can be improved.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointImplementation effect analysis.5. Conclusions(1)It greatly reduces the cost of input and maintenance and is conducive to achieving synergistic benefits. On the one hand, the nature of the blockchain is a series of program code, so its introduction cost is very low, so the supply chain enterprises do not need to make major changes to the original information processing system; on the other hand, the bottom layer of the blockchain technologies, such as asymmetric encryption, is very flexible to set up and deploy, which can be reset by manual intervention in emergency situations, greatly reducing later maintenance and operation costs, and it provides a new method to reduce costs and improve supply chain efficiency; this is a new model to realize the information supply chain(2)This will be described in detail in later studies and will not be described here.

"AbstractWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the combination of physical education and modern technology has become the development trend of today's physical education. Especially in the context of the reform of the education system, the connection between artificial intelligence and physical education is getting closer and closer and it has penetrated into all aspects of physical education. In terms of sports management, the sports management method based on big data artificial intelligence has gradually replaced the traditional manual management method and promoted the development of physical education. Strengthening the information management of physical education teaching and providing high-quality and efficient physical education information for physical education managers and teachers are an important part of the current school physical education teaching work. The establishment of sports resource information big data platform is the key to the integration and sharing of sports resources. This paper discusses the relevant theories of artificial intelligence and studies the current status of the application of sports resources.

"prospects, artificial intelligence is an important topic in the current field of computer science and technology. The in-depth application of artificial intelligence technology has become an inevitable choice for the modernization of national governance capabilities, opening a new digital era, and technologies such as big data and cloud computing have emerged. Big data is a collection of massive amounts of data. General software cannot process it in a short time.Sports is a manifestation of the overall strength of a country. Previously, the Chinese education department has listed physical education as the main teaching content at all stages. With the increasing number of course management and course evaluation, the traditional teaching methods cannot meet the requirements of the new era. In the face of massive sports management data, the requirements for school sports information management are also increasing. Manual management of these complex data is not only labor-intensive, but also prone to errors. This requires the use of scientific and technological means and information technology to standardize and manage these data. In the context of the development of artificial intelligence technology and big data technology, the management system of school sports information is becoming increasingly intelligent.

"management system of school sports information is becoming increasingly intelligent. Artificial intelligence uses information technology to manage, plan, and evaluate courses. It can accurately and quickly allocate teaching tasks reasonably for managers and can automatically give modified results according to changes in tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the multidisciplinary knowledge and methods such as information network technology and educational technology to establish a system suitable for the characteristics of physical education teaching. Digital technology can provide educational big data information for education authorities and provide reference data for future physical education work. Through the information management of school physical education teaching, the administrator can flexibly and accurately control the students' sports situation. At the same time, teachers can also develop a scientific teaching plan for students. It is found that the intelligent management method of school sports information is of great significance. Under the premise of ensuring the maintainability, stability, and compatibility of the system, each functional module is designed for different objects, the management structure of the data structure in the system is described, and its composition is analyzed in detail.2.

Related WorkWith the development of social economy and the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, it has been widely used in all walks of life. Through the systematic retrieval of eight electronic databases, N. Lander learned about the types and number of teachers' training in school physical exercise and basic sports ability, as well as the impact of teacher training on the effect of intervention and evaluated the influencing factors of school sports activities, including sports intervention provided by school teachers, including quantitative evaluation of FMS ability and PA. The results show that teachers can significantly improve students' performance in PA and FMS [1]. Sun et al. studied physical education from the perspective of self-determination theory. They explored the impact of self-determination theory on students' physical education learning from the areas of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning. They also illustrated the relationship between students' perceptions of the nature of autonomously supportive or controlled learning environments, needs satisfaction, and autonomous motivation [2].

The experiment found that students' aerobic, upper body, endurance, and abdominal muscles have been significantly improved, and body fat percentage was reduced. Conceptual physical education courses can significantly improve the health quality of freshmen [3]. Escrivaboulley et al., based on the cluster random control experiment, discussed the role of teachers' incentive factors in college students' physical exercise. They studied 15 primary school teachers and 293 students. Teachers in the experimental group participated in four seminars in a school year, while teachers in the control group carried out normal teaching activities. The experiment shows that, during school, the teachers in the experimental group increased the support for students' psychological needs, and the students in the experimental group spent significantly more time on physical activities [4]. Mooses et al. measured physical activity for 1 school year in 504 first-grade (7-9 years) and second-grade (10-12 years) children. This analysis uses the linear mixture method.

"method. According to the data, compared with time without physical activity, it has been confirmed that physical education can significantly increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time [5]. Sato and Haegele described the practical experience of mentoring severely disabled students in physical education. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, the research is conducted on real case studies and explained through the lens of occupational socialization theory. They studied three themes: the role of teachers in guiding physical education for analysis of vocational skill needs of disabled college students, and the resistance encountered in reality [6]. Silverman studied the attitudes of teachers and students in physical education. He used regression models in attitude research for analysis and discussed parameters and measurement issues in attitude research. He graded the attitudes of teachers and students and evaluated the impact of attitudes on sports performance [7].3. Artificial Intelligence and Physical Education3.1.

"software development for a long time. It is moving in the direction of strong artificial intelligence and super artificial intelligence. The so-called strong AI is a human-like artificial intelligence that can think, plan, and solve problems. And it can understand complex concepts and learn quickly. Super artificial intelligence has far more intelligence than humans. Some scholars believe that super artificial intelligence will be the ultimate invention of human beings. From now on, all inventions will be done by it [8]. Artificial intelligence technology originated at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. At the conference, scholars discussed a series of related issues in simulating intelligence with machines, marking the birth of the concept of artificial intelligence [9]. Academia has conducted in-depth research on knowledge representation, reasoning, and other issues. Artificial intelligence technology is very popular, covering fields such as education, physiology, medicine, logic, automation, and cybernetics. Its research scope includes information identification, acquisition and processing, search engine optimization, intelligent robots, and automatic learning and reasoning.Google's R&D personnel successfully developed the first self-driving car in October 2010 and successfully tested it on the streets of California [10].

"the first self-driving car in October 2010 and successfully tested it on the streets of California [10]. The application of intelligent driverless vehicles in the market has become more and more extensive. Tencent obtained the test license for ICVs in May 2018 [11], marking the cross-industry development of artificial intelligence technology to a mature stage. The artificial intelligence Go master (AlphaGo) defeated the Chinese Go player with a score of 3:0 in May 2017 and won the high praise of the world for artificial intelligence technology [12]. Artificial intelligence technology is being combined with technologies in multiple industries, and its development prospects are worthy of in-depth exploration.3.1.1. ANNANN is not only a calculation model, but also a data model. It mainly uses the biological neural network construction principle and function [13] and uses this topology to study the relationship between nodes or objects. The schematic diagram is shown in Figure1. The idea of artificial neural network comes from the functional operation of biological neural network. It is an adaptive system that is not affected by external data information. Each node represents an excitation function, and the links between nodes are represented by weights. This weight can be understood as the memory of the neural network [14].Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.1.2.

"nodes are represented by weights. This weight can be understood as the memory of the neural network [14].Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3.1.2. RBF Neural Network AlgorithmRBF neural network is a feedforward neural network with good performance [15]. Interpolation is an important part of function approximation. Its characteristic is to obtain an unknown continuous function under the constraint of discrete point setM. The function is defined on a continuous set S (M⊆S) to obtain the overall regularity. The interpolation problem can be defined as follows.Given datasetsXandY, whereXis a set withNdata points, and the dimensionnof each data point inX, that is, {Xi∈RnΙ,i= 1,2,...,N},Yis a set {Yi∈RmΙ,i= 1,2,...,N} withN m-dimensional data points. Find a functionF:Rn⟶Rmthat satisfies the following condition:(1)Strict interpolation requires that all known data points lie on the constructed interpolation surface (i.e., functionF). In the final analysis, RBF neural network technology is to construct such a functionF. The function has the following form:(2)Here, {φ(X−Xi)} is the set of N RBFs, and ‖⋅‖ represents the Euclidean norm. Take the known data pointXi∈Rndefined as the center of the RBF,i= 1,2,...,N.Bringing the interpolation conditions of formula (1) into formula (2), a set of linear formulas about N unknown weight coefficient vectorswican be obtained:(3)Here,φji=φ(Xj−Xi), and, wherei,j= 1,2,...,NLetΦ= {φjiΙ (j,i) = 1,2,...,N}.

Formula (3) can be written in compact form:(4)Commonly used basis functions are as follows:(5)These functions are all radially symmetric. One of the most widely used is the Gaussian function, which has the form:(6)Among them,idetermines the width of the center of the RBF;x−cirepresents the distance betweenxandciandi.Unlike strict interpolation problems, RBF is used when designing neural network structures. If a basis function is introduced for each sample point so that the number of neurons is equal to the number of input samples, the network structure will be too large, resulting in overfitting or network paralysis [16].Continue to make adjustments through network training until you get really close to the data sample. This improved network input-output mapping model is expressed as(7)Here,Ci∈Rnis the base function center;hrepresents the number of hidden layer units.

In particular, the Gaussian function greatly accelerates the efficiency of e-learning, avoids the problem of local minima, and has the ability to approximate the global optimum [17].3.2. Physical Education Teaching\"Artificial intelligence + physical education\" is a new teaching mode that transforms teaching resource structure and feedback evaluation mechanism into intelligent teaching. Through artificial intelligence technology, the resources and information connection between teachers and students can be realized, so as to form a new teaching system of \"artificial intelligence + physical education\" with multiple levels, wide fields, and multiple elements. The current domestic sports courses in China are mainly guided by digital teaching methods and focus on the diversification and reoptimization of information [18]. Therefore, artificial intelligence is a highly intelligent novel and advanced teaching system constructed by many artificial intelligence devices and information processing centers. Physical education resource information management is the main part of sports management. The normative and scientific nature of its management will affect the teaching effect.

"the main part of sports management. The normative and scientific nature of its management will affect the teaching effect. In practical application, it is divided into three distinct levels: teaching resource management, teaching operation management, and teaching quality and evaluation management. The coordinated operation of all levels together constitutes the \"artificial intelligence + physical education\" ecosystem. If you want the intelligent development of physical education, we must comply with the national sports policy and development trend and combine with modern science and technology [19]. The overall design that follows a top-down approach to form an overall operation mechanism model of \"artificial intelligence + physical education\" was constructed, as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall design follows a top-down approach to form an overall operation mechanism model of \"artificial intelligence + sports,\" as shown in Figure3.Each course and exercise will provide a lot of information. These materials can not only be used as a reference index for the final results of the physical education class but also provide training guidance for the next physical education class. However, in practice, we ignore data collection and analysis.

"we ignore data collection and analysis. Physical education teachers only rely on past experience to teach, adjust the teaching content, and lack the collection and analysis of data [20]. After scientific analysis and intelligent processing, managers can effectively understand the academic progress of teachers and students and better formulate overall plans, and teachers can find educational methods that are more beneficial to schools. The big data analysis of classroom teaching can evaluate the quality of the curriculum and reflect the educational goals and tasks of the school. The analysis of heart rate, steps, blood pressure, and other data can become indicators of sports health supervision. The data mining of teaching evaluation can help to adjust the teacher's curriculum and teaching content. Using big data for intelligent management and scientific analysis can become an important index to measure the quality of physical education in campus. This kind of powerful data analysis needs to be linked with the smart information management system for feedback and needs to be continuously optimized and rectified. By constantly using new technologies to support smart platforms, big data analysis information can be more accurately managed and scientifically classified, combining with large numbers to separate the management of physical education teaching mode and management of physical education and the transformation of teachers' functions and effectively reflect the physical"
"managed and scientifically classified, combining with large numbers to separate the management of physical education teaching mode and management of physical education and the transformation of teachers' functions and effectively reflect the physical needs and actual conditions of the vast majority of students.This paper constructs the sports information management system into a three-tier structure. They are presentation layer, functional layer, and application layer. They ensure that system users can practically apply the system, ensure that users can rely on the campus network, and ensure that users can conduct real-time anticounterfeiting of the system through the Internet to enhance the use value of the system, as shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointIn the system architecture, it is necessary to ensure that users can click through the different functions of the system through a web browser. Afterwards, based on the response of ASP.NET and the application server, the user's needs can be assigned to different system function modules to ensure that the system can feed the user's demand results back to the user.The traditional teaching management method is mainly based on filling in forms. Whether it is manual declaration or electronic entry, there are certain defects.

"declaration or electronic entry, there are certain defects. Its characteristics are that it needs to fill in and manage a lot of data, the data redundancy is large, the data query is time-consuming, and the data is inconvenient to use. The comprehensive evaluation of the data requires a lot of data collection, classification, calculation, etc., which cannot be fully utilized. The integrated functions such as data statistics and analysis can only realize the completion of a single work task and simple backup. Comprehensive and flexible sports information big data has realized the informatization of educational resources and greatly improves the development environment. The flexible object model and the functions of the classes and subclasses used constitute a new software development program. Its biggest feature is that it can perform remote control in the local database and connect the remote data with the local database.4. Operation Process of the Physical Education Information Management SystemThe database management system is mainly divided into teacher end and student end, and each end has its own access and modification authority. The physical education comprehensive information management system is mainly the management model of these two levels. In this way, management and query can be separated, which is convenient for system design and maintenance and more conducive to protecting the security of data.

"enthusiasm and teachers' enthusiasm are higher than those of the old system.6. ConclusionAs the development of artificial intelligence has a more and more profound impact on physical education activities, physical education teachers and managers should actively adapt to the trend of informatization and intelligence in physical education teaching and actively introduce artificial intelligence technology. Only in this way can we further strengthen the contents and methods of sports activities and cultivate students' enthusiasm to participate in sports. Using the artificial intelligence technology of big data, the information management of physical education teaching resources is realized, in addition to grades and physical fitness test results. It enables students to easily check their physical education selection, grades, and physical fitness indicators. It achieves convenient management and achieves the function of simple and rapid query, which reduces data redundancy and repeated manual operations in data management. The workload of physical education teachers is greatly reduced, and students can understand and master personal data and information at any time. The development of a comprehensive management system for physical education resources information provides strong support for the scientific, standardized, and computerized implementation of physical education management.

"education resources information provides strong support for the scientific, standardized, and computerized implementation of physical education management. On the basis of the design and implementation of the system platform, the relevant functional design can be further improved according to the school physical education curriculum setting and physical education research. It also discusses the effective connection with the school's comprehensive teaching management platform, and the integrated development with other management databases. In this way, the important position of physical education teaching in personnel training is more prominent. This paper studies and analyzes the physical education resource information management system completely. However, the system still has defects in function and data analysis, and there are still many needs to be optimized in practical operation.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the author upon reasonable request.References1Lander N.,Eather N.,Morgan P.

"surveys. After investigation and research, it was found that this system has good performance, meets the management needs of most communities, and can improve the management efficiency of community managers by 4%-6%; it has also improved community residents' satisfaction with digital community management by 2-3%.1. Introduction1.1. BackgroundMobile information system refers to the comprehensive communication platform based on modern mobile communication technology and mobile Internet technology, through the use of handheld terminals, servers, personal computers, and other equipment to communicate and interact to provide a full range of management and services to the society. With the development of the global information economy, the digital construction of urban communities in many countries and regions has been explored in theory and practice for many years. In order to serve the country and improve international competitiveness, these cities are racing to introduce digital, networked, and information foundations. Facility construction policies and measures have gradually expanded from the initial e-government to the digital management of urban communities. It has been developed for a long time and has relatively rich experience. The digital management of communities has become an extremely important part of national governance and social development.1.2.

"experience. The digital management of communities has become an extremely important part of national governance and social development.1.2. SignificanceMobile edge computing provides content providers and application developers with real-time radio access network (RAN) information, such as network load and user location information. This real-time network information can provide mobile users with context-aware services, thereby improving user experience and user service quality. Mobile edge computing adds corresponding responsibilities to the edge network, allows the edge network to perform tasks such as computing and services, and increases the management authority of the edge network to reduce the network delay and energy consumption of mobile users. Network operators allow third-party partners to process the edge of the wireless communication network. Therefore, for mobile users and enterprises, new applications and edge services will be deployed more quickly.1.3. Related WorkBlockchain, as the backbone technology of the currently popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve a preset proof-of-work problem in order to add new data (i.e., blocks) to the blockchain. However, solving the workload proof"
"and logistics, its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve a preset proof-of-work problem in order to add new data (i.e., blocks) to the blockchain. However, solving the workload proof consumes a lot of CPU time and energy resources and is not suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices. In order to promote blockchain applications in future mobile IoT systems, multiaccess mobile edge computing seems to be an auspicious solution to the proof-of-work problem of mobile users. Xiong et al. first introduced the new concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then, they introduced an economic method for edge computing resource management. In addition, a prototype of a blockchain system with mobile edge computing functions is provided, and experimental results are provided to prove [1]. But they only made great contributions to medical research and did not conduct too much research on community management. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is an emerging ecosystem that aims to converge telecommunications and IT services, providing a cloud computing platform at the edge of the radio access network (RAN). MEC provides storage and computing resources at the edge, thereby reducing the waiting time of mobile end users and making more effective use of mobile backhaul and core networks.

"edge, thereby reducing the waiting time of mobile end users and making more effective use of mobile backhaul and core networks. Taleb et al. introduced the MEC survey and focused on basic key supporting technologies. It has meticulously designed the MEC orchestration on the basis of considering a single service and the MEC platform network that supports mobility, which brings light to different orchestration deployment options. In addition, Taleb et al. analyzed the MEC reference architecture and main deployment scenarios, which provide multitenant support for application developers, content providers, and third parties. Finally, Taleb et al. outlined current standardization activities and further elaborated on the challenges of open research [2]. But they did not apply MEC technology to community services. The Multivillage Plan (MVS), which connects hundreds of villages and small towns to a large water distribution network, represents an emerging area of rural water supply in low-and middle-income countries. In this case, traditional rural water supply methods usually advocate community management, but the scale and complexity of MVS require alternative methods. Hutchings introduced three case studies of MVS from India, which focused on the role of the community in overall management.

"India, which focused on the role of the community in overall management. These illustrate the different mechanisms by which community management can or cannot be nested in the entire management system, as well as the different ways to promote community participation. The discussion provided an explanation for the differences between these case studies from the perspective of political economy, and from the perspective of public policy, Hutchings discussed how and why MVS can lead to the decline of community management in some cases [3]. But they only discussed why MVS would cause the decline of community management under certain circumstances and did not use the latest MEC technology to improve digital community management.1.4. InnovationUsing edge computing to design a digital community management system can reduce system running time and response time and reduce server bandwidth and lower energy consumption. The responsible subject of the community management system uses various information platforms and uses big data technology to explore and analyze the frequency of \"sensitive words\" and \"repetitive words\" and actively understand the public sentiment of the community. Prevention of emergencies can guide community residents to actively participate in the evaluation of community services and management and fully express their individualized requirements for public products and public services. It is possible for public services and needs within a fixed period of time. We"
"to actively participate in the evaluation of community services and management and fully express their individualized requirements for public products and public services. It is possible for public services and needs within a fixed period of time. We propose suggestions for improvement if there is a mismatch and then form a good multiparty interaction, information feedback, and measure correction mechanism. On the basis of solving information asymmetry, we realize the overall coordination of community service and management and system services, reduce community services, provide and use the intermediate cost, integrate service resources, improve use efficiency, accurately meet the all-round, personalized, and diversified needs of residents, and accurately, timely, and effectively monitor the type, scale, and quality of community service provision.2. Methods and Related Concepts2.1. Edge ComputingCloud computing is a type of distributed computing, which refers to the process of decomposing huge data computing processing programs into countless small programs through the network \"cloud\" and then processing and analyzing these small programs through a system composed of multiple servers to obtain results and return to the user.

"Compared with edge computing, the huge computing power provided by cloud computing makes it meaningful to perform heavy work on huge and heavy data sets. Most of the time, the concentration of cloud computing is better than the decentralized nature of edge computing in terms of speed, cost, and scalability, but cloud computing also has many shortcomings. In order to solve the deficiencies of cloud computing, edge computing has begun to arouse widespread attention in academia and industry. There has not been a unified definition of edge computing since it was put forward. It is widely understood that edge computing is a kind of building edge cloud by integrating edge computing and storage facilities at the edge of the network to provide cloud services and an IT operating environment for edge applications. Mobile edge computing is one of the important components of 5G communication technology. From the installation location, MEC is generally at the edge of the mobile network and in the wireless access network.Deployed in a location close to mobile users, MEC's main task is to reduce time delay, ensure efficient network operation and service delivery capabilities, and also achieve a better user experience. More software-defined networks are introduced in 5G communications, and IT virtualization technology is widely used in hardware infrastructure. MEC is a key technology and architecture for the evolution of 5G communications. It represents the transition from mobile broadband"
"networks are introduced in 5G communications, and IT virtualization technology is widely used in hardware infrastructure. MEC is a key technology and architecture for the evolution of 5G communications. It represents the transition from mobile broadband networks to software-defined networks. Latency, scalability, and throughput meet the demanding requirements of 5G networks. Figure1shows a simplified version of the MEC architecture. The MEC server is deployed next to the mobile base station to provide edge computing capabilities for terminal devices.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointMEC architecture.2.2. Edge Computing Business ScenariosThe main business scenarios of edge computing include but are not limited to the following three:(1)Decentralized traffic model: a large number of sensors are connected to the edge of the network to generate huge uplink data and computing requests. The network traffic is developing from vertical to flat. The edge cloud makes local decisions at the source of the traffic and forwards it from east to west through clustering, reducing network bandwidth and central cloud pressure [4](2)Services that require stringent delay: in the fields of intelligent vehicle networking, unmanned driving, and intelligent manufacturing, most businesses require a delay of up to 10 ms, which is an absolute delay-sensitive business. Through the nearby processing of the edge cloud, the network transmission delay can be greatly reduced to meet the needs of such"
"and intelligent manufacturing, most businesses require a delay of up to 10 ms, which is an absolute delay-sensitive business. Through the nearby processing of the edge cloud, the network transmission delay can be greatly reduced to meet the needs of such applications [5](3)Data preprocessing business [6]: smart IoT devices continuously generate massive amounts of streaming data, which can perform preprocessing such as data filtering and desensitization when the data flows through the edge cloud, which can not only avoid the waste of network bandwidth resources but also meet the requirements of privacy and security. [7].2.3. Comparison of Edge Computing and Cloud ComputingEdge computing is not to replace cloud computing but to complement and expand cloud computing. Through edge computing, it can make up for the shortcomings of cloud computing, such as location awareness and mobile support [8]. From the perspective of bionics, edge computing and cloud computing are similar to the relationship between nerve endings and the brain. The preprocessing of data by edge computing is equivalent to the unconditioned reflex of nerve endings to external stimuli, and the historical analysis and mining of data by cloud computing are equivalent to the memory and logic processing functions of the brain.

Digital Community ManagementDigital information has the advantages of no distortion, anti-interference, encryption, and easy storage. Digital management of urban communities is the introduction of information technology, especially digital technology, into community management. On the basis of the digital community system and digital management technology that has been formed, the wishes of various departments, units, and residents participating in community management are carried out. Their actions and interactions are unified and coordinated, the enthusiasm and creativity of various subjects participating in community governance are maximized and work together to do a good job in community services, the quality of community management is improved, good community governance and social order are achieved, and the needs of residents for a better life and enhance happiness are further met"
"and work together to do a good job in community services, the quality of community management is improved, good community governance and social order are achieved, and the needs of residents for a better life and enhance happiness are further met [10].From the content point of view, the digital management of urban communities covers the use of digital technology in the political, economic, and cultural management of urban communities, including the establishment of community organizations, population management, education services, ecological environment governance, scientific and technological cultural services, ideological and moral construction, implementation of digital management in labor and social security, public security management, and convenience services. The foundation of digital management is to establish a digital management system, and the key to digital management is to improve various management systems and mechanisms [11,12]. At present, the basic digital management technology system and database that need to be established for the digital management of urban communities in my country mainly include the following four aspects:(1)Community basic data statistics system: this system should include community area, infrastructure (amount of facilities, grade, distribution, development level, etc.), location, economic status, and population (occupation structure, age structure, gender structure, knowledge structure, etc.)(2)Community information inquiry and help"
"infrastructure (amount of facilities, grade, distribution, development level, etc.), location, economic status, and population (occupation structure, age structure, gender structure, knowledge structure, etc.)(2)Community information inquiry and help system: this system responds to various policies, regulations, and rules related to open government affairs, such as social security, military support, medical, health, and old-age care, tourism, meteorology, shopping, food and entertainment, and housekeeping, family education services, home appliance repair, job introduction, and life service information, as well as emergency services such as fire alarm, public security, ambulance, and house emergency repairs, providing inquiries and online processing services [13](3)Social public facilities operation system: this system is a comprehensive digital management system including road traffic, water supply, gas supply, power supply, communication, and other public facilities in the community to provide the community public with payment, inquiries, and inquiries that are not restricted by time and space [14](4)Management decision analysis system: this system is oriented to community management departments, including the analysis and prediction of community operation status, needs, problems, and benefits.

"and prediction of community operation status, needs, problems, and benefits. It provides a decision-making basis and plans for community management departments to facilitate their timely understanding of community information, grasp the situation, and efficiently make decisions and management related to the community [15]2.5. Trust EvaluationThe edge computing environment is essentially an open system. The trust relationship in it involves interaction, expectations, and environment. It is difficult to carry out systematic and accurate trust management. In addition to the distributed characteristics, the integration and integration of trust management are difficult. Timely feedback cannot guarantee the timeliness, and the result will lose value. In recent years, research on trust prediction models for open environments has focused on reflecting the complexity and time-varying nature of dynamic predictions, such as point-to-point computing and wireless ad hoc networks. These studies can be used as a reference for establishing a trust model for edge computing, but some issues still need to be further considered in the process of conclusion migration:(1)The goal of trust prediction in most open environments is the overall credibility, while the existing prediction models have a large subjective component, which affects the reference value of the results, and the parameter weights of each part of the model are relatively fixed. In practical applications, the model lacks"
"credibility, while the existing prediction models have a large subjective component, which affects the reference value of the results, and the parameter weights of each part of the model are relatively fixed. In practical applications, the model lacks flexibility and adaptability(2)On the basis of openness, edge computing also has the characteristics of the distribution. Some environments have requirements for individual terminal devices and overall trust value. In the process of trust feedback, the range and number of model prediction objects will directly affect the operating speed of the system and the cost of the network; that is, the size of the model processing problem is directly related to the scalability of the system(3)The most important problem of the trust prediction model is how to ensure the timeliness of prediction results. Due to the dynamic changes of the environment, the predicted results at the current stage will gradually lose their utility over time; that is, the length of the interval directly affects the contribution of the predicted results. At present, most studies have insufficiently considered the relationship between the dynamic changes of the environment and the timeliness of the prediction results, which in turn affects the practical application value of the model [16]In the process of performing specific computing tasks, resource constraints usually lead to huge differences in the number of AEU service requests and responses. Some AEUs refuse"
"which in turn affects the practical application value of the model [16]In the process of performing specific computing tasks, resource constraints usually lead to huge differences in the number of AEU service requests and responses. Some AEUs refuse to disclose identity information due to privacy considerations but still seek interaction. Some AEUs require high-level services due to real-time services. As a security mechanism, some AEUs only hope to obtain positive benefits from resource interaction without contributing any resources they hold. The above-mentioned AEUs all have nontrust characteristics, which makes it difficult to establish a targeted trust evaluation method. In addition, it is unreliable to use a single factor to evaluate trust. For example, the authentication mechanism usually only has two results: pass or fail [17]. Considering the complexity of AEU when performing resource interaction or application services, trust values with multiple key attributes need to be considered [18].2.5.1. Attribute-Based Trust EvaluationThere are a variety of attributes that can be used to describe terminal equipment and basic characteristics such as identity, function, data type, and area attribution, in addition to computing resources, storage size, and occupied bandwidth. First, we define the trust property of ECU as follows:(1)(1)Identity Trust. Identity data is the most basic data of a terminal device, so we first consider the influence of the device's identity on trust"
"resources, storage size, and occupied bandwidth. First, we define the trust property of ECU as follows:(1)(1)Identity Trust. Identity data is the most basic data of a terminal device, so we first consider the influence of the device's identity on trust evaluation. Existing identity security management mostly relies on real-name authorization and only provides services for authorized devices. On the other hand, terminal devices have a great demand for anonymous access services. Public key infrastructure (PKI) can realize anonymous P2P trusted communication in distributed networks and has been extensively studied in the identity information management of edge computing. Considering the fact that identity trust is a part of the entire trust evaluation, and some of the contents are simplified, a lightweight key generation method is proposed [19,20]. In the process of the resource request, the identity trust of ECU is defined as Vi. The calculation method of Vi is realized by the elliptic curve encryption algorithm ECC. First, a discrete elliptic curveEis given by the ECC algorithm as shown in(2)First, we randomly select a pointO(x,y) on the curve and then generate the public key and private key through the following two steps:Step 1: server key generation edge server generates a key pair (Kp,Ks) according to the following formulae:(3)(4)The formulaKpis obtained by the hash function H about the ECU identity informationIland the edge service informationIe. After obtaining the"
"1: server key generation edge server generates a key pair (Kp,Ks) according to the following formulae:(3)(4)The formulaKpis obtained by the hash function H about the ECU identity informationIland the edge service informationIe. After obtaining the public keyKp, the private key is obtained through the encoding functionMonKp. After calculating the key, the edge server sends the identity information to the ECU, and the identity information is shown in(5)Step 2 (ECU key generation): after the ECU receives the identity informationD, it can generate three key formulae:(6)(7)(8)The virtual keyKviis used to protect the real identity information of the ECU,KepandKes, respectively, represent the public key and private key generated by the ECU, andR1 andR2 are pseudorandom number generation functions.Then, the ECU will send the informationFto the edge server for key matching, andαrepresents the temporary parameter. The expression of informationFis shown in(9)(2)Behavioral Trust. The terminal equipment sending out service requests or responses is an important basis for trust evaluation. Behavior involves many factors. Because the edge computing environment requires real time and effectiveness, and terminal equipment usually has limited resources, trust evaluation is being carried out. At this time, it is necessary to focus on factors directly related to trust evaluation. The behavioral credibility shown in the service request or response process is defined as behavioral trust Vb, which"
"resources, trust evaluation is being carried out. At this time, it is necessary to focus on factors directly related to trust evaluation. The behavioral credibility shown in the service request or response process is defined as behavioral trust Vb, which is mainly composed of three parts in(10)(3)Behavior Constraints. Behavioral constraints Vbc represent the specifications that the terminal must comply with when running in the current environment, including interaction constraints or interaction specifications for specific behaviors, such as minimum duration and moving range. Generally, the terminal is subject to several constraints [21]. When the specific calculation tasks of the ECU change, the corresponding specifications usually change. Vbc can be expressed by(11)(4)Behavioral Interaction. As the edge computing environment continues to change, it is necessary to consider the impact of changes in terminal behavior on trust evaluation. This paper adopts the method of time series analysis to avoid the limitation of terminal type for trust evaluation, analyze the behavior changes of other terminal devices and the device during the interaction, and reduce the computational burden caused by trust analysis. First of all, the behavioral interaction of the target ECU is defined as Vbe. Vbe reflects the credibility of the interaction in the past period of time. The most basic interaction can also get an effective trust evaluation. If the ECU has not interacted before, the default"
"interaction of the target ECU is defined as Vbe. Vbe reflects the credibility of the interaction in the past period of time. The most basic interaction can also get an effective trust evaluation. If the ECU has not interacted before, the default Vbe is 0.5; the time series can be defined as follows:(12)For ECUj, a temporary thresholdαj∈ (0,1) is allocated to it according to the total amount of interactive resources, which is defined as follows:(13)Vbe can be derived from(14)(5)Behavior Change Rate. The change rate of terminal behavior usually means the change of trust. It is necessary to study whether there is a risk in this change. To define the change rate of behavior as Vbr, then there is(15)3. Digital Community Management Mobile Information System Based on Edge Computing3.1. Overall Architecture of the Community Management Mobile Information SystemIn the current system development stage, some large-scale software systems are programmed to develop using object-oriented development methods. The object-oriented method is mainly derived from specific software-oriented programming, and its fundamental meaning is to target specific software. We purposely develop some software systems in the things around us and express our human thoughts and thinking as much as possible in this system software.

"our human thoughts and thinking as much as possible in this system software. The development of application software is mainly aimed at people's living habits and characteristics. A large part of subjectively developed programs that conform to people's lifestyles is aimed at some special masses. For the community users themselves, targeted development programs are for more systematic use of the management operating system, making both users and managers have a certain degree of practicality and convenience [22]. Figure2is the overall architecture of the development system.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall architecture of the system.Community managers can log in to this system to manage the information of the residents of the community and update the information of house rental and sale in real time and can also add, delete, modify, and check the local database.3.2. System Design PrinciplesThe design of a digital community management mobile information system based on edge computing is a very complex project. In the design, the following five aspects are mainly considered:(1)The practicality of the system: to be simple, practical, and humanized, to achieve a unified application interface, unified user management, and unified identity authentication, and to meet the needs of personalized information services [23](2)Advancement: it should be advanced and forward-looking in design ideas, system structure, and platform selection; it adopts advanced and mature"

It can exist independently and coexist with other systems, and it can also support subsequent development and research(4)Reliability: the system design must meet the design requirements of performance indicators. The network structure, network equipment, server equipment, etc. must be designed and constructed with high reliability to improve the safety and reliability of the entire digital community computer network and application system(5)Scalability: the construction of the digital community needs to be gradually and continuously expanded. For this reason, the system needs to adopt component technology to support the combination, inheritance, and online definition of applications [25]3.3.

The detailed module framework of the system is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointFrame diagram of each module of the system.The community information query module can help community residents keep abreast of real-time news reports and community announcements. The community service module can help residents understand the latest employment trends and information about housing rentals and sales. The fee payment module can make it more convenient and fast for owners to pay for utilities and other living expenses.3.4. Main Database DesignThe functions of the community digital management mobile information network system are very comprehensive, so there are many tables involved in the system, and it is not possible to list them all. Here, only the structure of the tables involved in the implementation of the system is listed as follows. The user information table is mainly used to store the basic information of the unit or user, the unit user can register its legal person information, and the household can register the head of the household information.

Satisfaction Survey of the Mobile Information SystemIn addition, we also conducted a satisfaction survey on the mobile information system designed this time; the 100 community owners who participated in the satisfaction survey have the same comprehensive situation in terms of moral quality and physical and mental health, etc. And the survey results are shown in Figure5:Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointSatisfaction degree of owners of different age groups with the system.It can be seen from Figure5that most of the young owners are satisfied with the system design. They are more familiar with the operation of the community management system. There is a large majority of the elderly who are not satisfied with the management system designed this time. It is not humane enough, and there are no operating prompts for the elderly. It is easy to misunderstand the elderly. I hope that the management system designed this time needs to be improved and perfected.5.

"mobile information system designed and developed in this paper based on edge computing has brought convenience to our lives. However, due to the tight development time, this system still has many shortcomings that need to be improved and there are many module functions that have not been implemented. The construction of a digital community management mobile information system based on edge computing in my country is still in its infancy. The wishes of various departments, units, and residents are scattered and cannot be effectively unified. It is necessary to achieve a ladder from the initial stage, the intermediate stage to the advanced stage. For development, there are still a lot of problems and difficulties that need to be solved. On the one hand, we must break down the barriers between departments, effectively coordinate the actions and interactions of various units and departments in the jurisdiction, mobilize the enthusiasm of all entities involved in community management to the greatest extent, give play to their respective creativity, and work together to do a good job in the community. We provide services to improve the quality of community management and achieve a good new order of community governance.
