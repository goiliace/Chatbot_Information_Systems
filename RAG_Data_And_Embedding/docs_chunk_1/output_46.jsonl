Abdirad and Krishnan have fully described the advantages and disadvantages of both technologies and pointed out that the integration of the two technologies will be more efficient and reliable in engineering and scientific fields, especially in acquiring, processing, and distributing data in dynamic environments [10]. The application areas of wireless sensor networks in the logistics chain are analyzed by Sadeeq and Zeebaree [11]. The prospect of wireless sensor networks in logistics is analyzed mainly in the fields of warehouse environment monitoring, hazardous materials, and cold chain logistics management. WSN technology can collect various types of information and has the advantages of being massively configurable, unattended, long sensing distance, and low cost. Its disadvantage is that it only cares about collecting data, and the marking capability is not enough; in addition, there is some difficulty in low power consumption and high lifetime [12].Ping et al. proposed a WSN-RFID colocation method by studying the positioning technology of passive UHF RFID and WSN network positioning technology and used the method to solve the problem of area positioning and precise positioning of storage vehicles on precise"

WSN can make up for the lack of RFID networking and transmission capabilities, increasing the flexibility of node deployment [19,20]. In the logistics and distribution chain, the positioning system and manual inspection-based monitoring means cannot meet the demand for real-time monitoring of goods. However, such as the camera tracking video surveillance wiring complex and high requirements for light, sight distance conditions are not suitable for use in narrow transport containers.

Especially in gesture detection, acceleration sensors have been mostly seen in gesture recognition, motion recognition, and other gesture detection research. With the improvement of sensor technology, six-axis acceleration sensors can provide more accurate acceleration and provide posture angle data compared to three-axis sensors. This study is aimed at solving the problems of warehouse positioning and safety monitoring of goods in transit in the logistics process and to providing a powerful solution for the information transformation of small and medium-sized logistics enterprises and self-built logistics, helping them to shorten the development cycle, reduce development costs, and improve development efficiency.3.

With the objectives of maximizing the number of outgoing cargo space and minimizing the number of incoming cargo space, the decision optimization model of cargo space allocation is constructed by considering the constraints of storage taboo, type constraints, physical condition constraints, and quantity equilibrium, to coordinate the stage plan of cargo space allocation within a certain period.

The social risk caused by all transportation in the transport network is shown in the following equation.(3)The costs incurred for all transportation in the transportation road network are shown in the following equation.(4)In the problem of pathway mode selection, we need to choose the next arrival node and the transportation mode. In this case, we first transform the original transport network. Moreover, the transport decisions are related not only to the population density of the next way segment and the transport cost but also to the cost of transport mode conversion at that node. Therefore, the heuristic information for this problem is defined as the following equation.(5)In the transport box, warehouse, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and other places of stay to install RFID systems, related monitoring sensing and environmental regulation and other facilities and equipment, transport, and combined storage business operation links for the unit configuration of front-end monitoring terminals, which transport links, transport tools installed satellite navigation system terminal.

In the process of logistics transportation, transportation tools use satellite navigation system terminals to receive location information through satellite navigation system positioning services, and satellite navigation system terminals use their communication technology or other communication technology to assist and communicate with the front-end monitoring platform.

"so as to realize the intelligent active monitoring and tracking process of the goods in transit.3.2. Optimization of Positioning Algorithm Based on RFID TechnologyThe accuracy of RFID positioning systems is influenced by the positioning method, but the choice of RFID tag type and the addition of a reference tag also play a decisive role in positioning accuracy. Various positioning solutions have their characteristics and advantages. In actual use, in addition to the consideration of positioning accuracy, the ease of arrangement of the system, expandability, and system cost are related to the choice of RFID positioning solution. RFID received signal strength is the indicator value given by the reader by measuring the signal strength received by itself. Different models have a significant impact on the ranking results, and this paper selects the logarithmic distance path loss model generally followed by the actual indoor environment for representation, as in equation (6). The unit ofH(d) in the formula is dBm, which indicates the path loss when the distance between reader and label isd;d0indicates the path loss when the near reference distanced0;wis the path loss factor, which indicates the path loss rate of growth with distance, the value is environment-dependent, the path loss factor for different materials will be given in engineering or can be obtained by taking experimental measurements to fit the curve;Zβdenotes a normal random variable with a standard deviation ofβand"

Due to the influence of noise and other effects, the strength of the actual signal is often smaller than the estimated value of the position, increasing the derived estimated distance, so the measured radius is large, and the three circles do not intersect at a point but form an intersection. The position of the tag to be located is in this intersection. Therefore, in practical applications, the triangle center-of-mass localization algorithm is generally used, where the center-of-massMof the triangle with the intersection of the three circles as the vertex is used as the estimate of the actual pointO.

The coordinates of the intersection point of the three circles are calculated. In this case, the intersection pointDis calculated as shown in the following equation.(9)For the triangle mass center algorithm, the two-dimensional plane under the three sides of the positioning still needs three known locations of the reader node and can be positioned range is only the intersection of three readers read and write range, that is, 3 degrees coverage area. If the location to be measured exceeds the intersection range, only in 1 degree or 2 degrees under the coverage area, it cannot be positioned. If it increases the read-write node one way or another, not only will it increase the hardware equipment overhead and the algorithm complexity, it also will bring communication interference and other problems. If it simply reduces the read-write node quantity, it will cause a larger scope of the uncovered area and affect the positioning accuracy. Due to the modern storage center's larger area, to interval arrangement shelves mainly placement scene, the traditional trilateral measurement or triangle mass center positioning algorithm cannot meet the positioning demand.

Therefore, the actual measured radius is too large. The three circles do not intersect at a point, but form an intersection. The position of the label to be located is in this intersection. Therefore, in practical applications, the triangle centroid positioning algorithm is generally used, and the centroidMof the triangle with the intersection of the three circles as the vertex is used as the estimated value of the actual pointO.3.3.

In this network, the RFID reader first reads the RFID tag or RFID sensor tag data via RFID to identify a single product, while the sensor collects information about the surrounding environment. Then, the identity and environmental information of this single product will be sent to the wireless repeater, which will then be distributed to the corresponding subscribers in the wireless network"
"collects information about the surrounding environment. Then, the identity and environmental information of this single product will be sent to the wireless repeater, which will then be distributed to the corresponding subscribers in the wireless network via Wi-Fi protocol. As a subscriber of the information, the smart RFID terminal will filter, cluster, and encode the RFID information and sensing information after receiving it. For different application needs, the processed data will be stored directly in the remote data center or sent to other RFID service providers for further processing, or it can be integrated directly with the applications on the smart terminal through the business engine on the smart terminal for business processing. In this integrated networking scheme, the smart RFID terminal will assume more data processing and transmission functions as an edge server to prepare for the massive data processing of the IoT system. Therefore, the development of a flexible and scalable middleware on mobile devices will become the core technology of RFID and WSN integration.Figure2shows the overall architecture of the intelligent logistics supply chain management system. According to the deployment method, this middleware can be divided into the mobile terminal part and the remote server part.

"can be divided into the mobile terminal part and the remote server part. The middleware of the mobile terminal includes the device access layer, data processing layer, business processing layer, and mobile application layer, while the remote server will further process the data according to ALE specification and connect to the enterprise's data center or public information platform. For example, in the production line of wine products, RFID information read by readers will be filtered and coded by mobile terminals and sent directly to the remote ALE server, which will update the back-end data center. Here, the mobile middleware will play the function of the adapter, making full use of the flexibility of the mobile terminal and reducing the cost of enterprise hardware wiring. As for the scenario of wine logistics supply chain tracking, the business engine processing module of the mobile middleware is needed to complete complex operations such as product warehousing, verification, and distribution and track the corresponding status.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe overall architecture of intelligent logistics supply chain management system.The device access layer provides interfaces to various devices, interacts with hardware, provides a unified interface for different manufacturers of reading and writing devices and sensors, shields the heterogeneity of hardware, and facilitates hardware integration.

Different physical readers will be grouped by logical readers, and the collected RFID events will be integrated with the sensor events that arrive at the same time and filtered and regrouped according to the time stamp, RFID events, and sensing information. The business processing layer takes the encoded RFID events as input and uses its powerful business execution engine to track the business execution status and process the business execution logic. The execution engine separates the engine algorithm logic from the business execution logic and uses the enterprise service bus to distribute the execution services to different nodes to achieve a distributed service architecture.

Analysis of Results4.1. Attitude Detection AnalysisSimulation analysis is done with MATLAB using different algorithms to derive the pose detection results of the pose detection samples in each segment. It is obvious from the figure that the support vector machine optimized by the genetic algorithm has the best results for pose detection, and the results of pose detection by SVM default parameters, SVM optimized by genetic algorithm and BP neural network algorithm is compared, it is found that the pose detection results of the support vector machine optimized by the genetic algorithm are closer to the actual values, and the pose detection accuracy is higher, as shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointAttitude detection test set.When the overturning action of the cargo occurs, as shown in Figure4, the acceleration values in all three directions before the overturning are low, and the cargo is in a stable state, or there are low positive and negative alternating acceleration values, i.e., in a swaying state. When"
"cargo occurs, as shown in Figure4, the acceleration values in all three directions before the overturning are low, and the cargo is in a stable state, or there are low positive and negative alternating acceleration values, i.e., in a swaying state. When overturned, the acceleration of the goods in two or more directions changes sharply, and the maximum acceleration is related to the volume of the goods, the labeling position, and the direction of the overturning, but is much greater than the acceleration of the shaking and less than the acceleration generated by the direct impact. Cargo overturning is also often accompanied by the three-dimensional acceleration state law of the impact, that is, the overturning direction acceleration changes instantly, and fluctuations are obvious. The most important feature of the whole tipping action that distinguishes it from the impact is the existence of gravitational axial change before and after tipping, the change of attitude angle of 90° in the time window before and after tips.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPoint3D acceleration and attitude angle characteristics in the overturned attitude.4.2.

"localization algorithm for solving the problem, as computed by the localization algorithm described in the previous section, is shown in Figure5. As can be seen from the algorithm performance tracking schematic, the objective value of the resulting transportation decision scheme gradually becomes better as the number of evolutionary generations increases, and the algorithm converges to an optimized solution when it has evolved to about 300 generations.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointPerformance tracking schematic.Intelligent logistics in the storage and transportation process has a large hazardous and harmful nature, with transport path, transport time constraints, and dynamic nature. To effectively improve the efficiency of storage and transportation and optimize the control means, based on summarizing various influencing factors on transportation decision in intelligent logistics transportation network, under the constraints of section transportation capacity and transportation path time window, and to minimize social risk and transportation cost, the intelligent logistics transportation decision model is constructed to determine the transportation path, mode, and departure time of intelligent logistics between different ODs.

"ODs. Based on the characteristics of the model, the ant colony algorithm of elite strategy is designed to solve it. The transport decision calculation cases with 8 transit nodes and 6 OD flow directions show that the model and algorithm have good feasibility and effectiveness.The localization error is observed for different values ofMunder both localization algorithms, and it decreases gradually with the increase of the number of nodes and the increase of the localization coverage. The full localization coverage can be achieved only when the number of anchor nodes reaches 27 under the conventional localization algorithm; therefore, some nodes cannot be effectively localized whenM= 15. As shown in Figure6(a), when the number of nodesM= 30, as in Figure6(b), all the tags can be localized. Figure6(c) shows the error result of the two.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointPositioning error of traditional positioning algorithm.When the number of anchor nodes is small, the positioning cannot be completed at some locations, so the error is large. For the secondary localization algorithm designed in this paper, when the number of anchor nodes reaches 10, the full coverage of the localization area has been completed, so that the error stabilizes in a small range. When the number of anchor nodes is large enough, the errors of both algorithms tend to be stable. The RSSI-based weighted center-of-mass algorithm and the proximity ranging based on moving anchor nodes in the secondary"
"error stabilizes in a small range. When the number of anchor nodes is large enough, the errors of both algorithms tend to be stable. The RSSI-based weighted center-of-mass algorithm and the proximity ranging based on moving anchor nodes in the secondary positioning method can further reduce the errors. The overall stability of the positioning system is further improved. The signal strength-based weighted center-of-mass localization algorithm is used to compensate for the neglect of the anchor node credibility by the traditional algorithm. Through simulation experiments, it can be seen that the method can effectively reduce the number of nodes required for positioning under the same positioning area and provide a method to improve the effective coverage, and the positioning accuracy and coverage are better than the traditional triangular center-of-mass positioning algorithm and effectively reduce the cost of storage positioning.4.3. System Simulation AnalysisThe simulated data with the same RFID tag is repeatedly sent 100 times, and then the simulator generates a new tag number to send, while the middleware filter rules define that the same RFID data is received only once per second, so most of the data will be filtered out by the filter, and the remaining events are grouped, coded, and sent to the business processing layer. The business processing layer is a simple single-task linear process, and the system will test the response time and loss rate of the entire middleware"
"by the filter, and the remaining events are grouped, coded, and sent to the business processing layer. The business processing layer is a simple single-task linear process, and the system will test the response time and loss rate of the entire middleware when invoking the ESB component library service and the local service, respectively. The test results are shown in Figure7. For the average response time (from the middleware receiving data to the end of processing), at lower test rates, the invocation of the ESB component library service takes longer than the direct invocation of the local component because of the additional network communication required; however, as the test rate increases, the average response time for the invocation of the ESB component library service only increases smoothly because the load is distributed among the ESB component's network services. However, the average response time for direct calls to local components increases dramatically as local resources become the bottleneck of the system. Therefore, for large-scale data concurrent network environments, using a distributed ESB component library can greatly improve the scalability and performance of the system. 100,000 test events were sent continuously at a rate of 100 events per second, and the test results showed that the server was running normally, with an average response time of 26.316 ms and a system loss rate of 0.000218 (218/100,000).Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointRFID test"

For this indicator, in this paper, a stress test was conducted on the system by sending a large number of tag updates in a short period and using a cyclic sending method to observe the performance load capacity and information processing capacity of the system. At the same time, the content and number of tags sent are recorded to see if there are any problems such as omissions at the receiving end and to check the integrity of the system sends. Through the test, the system latency increased significantly when the system concurrency was at 600, and the sending performance of the system became significantly slower. The system latency increased significantly, and the statistics of sending-receiving data showed that the system began to lose packets at 700 concurrencies. The experimental results are shown in Figure8. From the above experimental data, it can be seen that the range of parallel data that the system can accept for normal operation"

From the above experimental data, it can be seen that the range of parallel data that the system can accept for normal operation is (1000, 1500), and if the parallel data that the system needs to process exceeds this range, its operation speed will be rapidly reduced. At this stage, the system capacity can meet the actual demand.Figure 8Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem response speed test.The logistics company will need to check the material and label information again when the material is loaded and recover the remaining RFID label in the hands of the material supplier, to clarify the responsibility of all parties.

And on this basis, it broadens the whole logistics process of warehousing and distribution and designs a monitoring system framework to realize the management process of the main business of warehousing and logistics. For the traditional RFID-based warehouse positioning method hardware wiring complex, the number of positioning nodes is too large, the effective coverage rate is low, and this paper designs a WSN and RFID integration of the anchor node; first, the node's wireless data transmission capabilities can directly and effectively solve the problem of wiring complexity. Second, the positioning anchor node without data line bondage can adopt a mobile strategy, which also provides an opportunity to seek to reduce the number of positioning nodes.

In the implementation of this paper, although the problem of anticheating is also considered, there are still many shortcomings, and the common cheating and invasion methods can be better prevented, but for professional invasion and cheating, the system still has many shortcomings. And the research on the collision problem of tags is not very deep.

The experimental results show that in 2019, the investment of e-commerce enterprises in hardware products decreased by 3.3% and the proportion of software and information services increased by 2% and 1.3%, respectively. The enterprise information resource management model constructed in this paper has very important practical significance.1. IntroductionIn the current market environment of the network economy, information is a very important resource, and it has also become one of the important factors of productivity [1]. Enterprise information resource management should pay attention to the research of technology application, avoid duplication of information construction and scattered waste, reduce the loss of information in the way of information collection, and avoid redundancy when using information [2]. The core task of enterprise information resource management is to improve the ability of enterprise to collect, process, and apply information resources, realize the promotion of information resources, enhance the ability of enterprise production and operation value creation, and maximize the investment of information construction. In the information age, building a new model of enterprise information resource management is one of the most effective means to enhance the core competitiveness of enterprises, and it is also the core issue of enterprise information resource organization and"
"information age, building a new model of enterprise information resource management is one of the most effective means to enhance the core competitiveness of enterprises, and it is also the core issue of enterprise information resource organization and management. Nowadays, the rapid development of digital, network, and other technologies has led to the rapid increase in the renewal of various industries [3]. Together with the development of world-free trade and global integration, the survival and competitive environment of modern enterprises are also changing. New enterprises in each industry are becoming more and more; it has led to vicious competition among enterprises for making money and has destroyed the living environment of the entire industry [4]. The information based on the three traditional resources of land, capital, and labor will become the strategic resources of enterprises during the fourth World War. The importance of information as a factor of production is increasing day by day. Information resource management based on information resource has become an important condition for enterprises to improve their competitiveness. No matter in the production industry or service industry, the basic activities of enterprises can be expressed by value chain. The author thinks that the enterprise information resource management can innovate the means of information resource management from the perspective of value chain and construct the value chain management mode"
"enterprises can be expressed by value chain. The author thinks that the enterprise information resource management can innovate the means of information resource management from the perspective of value chain and construct the value chain management mode of information resource management. Through the e-commerce data exchange center, consumers who want to buy a certain product can timely compare the quotations and product performance of numerous suppliers around the world. Buyers often have access to suppliers' information about their products, services, and offers. Their buying behavior has become very effective. At the same time, the industry oversupply, product and process innovation, a lot of information that can be seen everywhere, smart consumers, and other factors (such as fast pace of life, improved production efficiency, and quality) make any commodity quickly become common consumer goods, which inevitably leads to the enterprise involuntarily into the price war, and the declining trend of profits is increasingly obvious. It is very difficult for manufacturers to create a unique product image in the eyes of consumers. Therefore, if an enterprise wants to lead the industry and seize opportunities in the current social competition [5], the key is to have a large amount of information resources and to manage and use the information resources it owns, that is, to manage the large amount of information collected and reasonable use different types of information [6].

"competition [5], the key is to have a large amount of information resources and to manage and use the information resources it owns, that is, to manage the large amount of information collected and reasonable use different types of information [6]. By discovering the changes of customers′ demands, the enterprise puts forward and implements the strategy of meeting customers′ new demands in time and constantly creates cost value for customers. To a great extent, the success of enterprise e-commerce activities depends on the level and quality of information resource management. The model of information resource value chain management not only emphasizes information technology but also emphasizes the coordination and management of all departments, objectively examines the current situation of enterprise development, and correctly guides the future development direction of enterprise.More and more users develop or integrate cross functional, enterprise, or infrastructure systems into an organization, with little involvement of senior management or central information technology (it) departments. Chua, Cecil Eng Huang suggested that the bottom-up enterprise information system will reshape the central IT, making it more involved in governance, coordination and strategy formulation, and less involved in actual implementation and maintenance. Effective management of bottom-up enterprise information system needs effective distributed leadership, including establishing power balance,"
"in governance, coordination and strategy formulation, and less involved in actual implementation and maintenance. Effective management of bottom-up enterprise information system needs effective distributed leadership, including establishing power balance, fuzzy roles, trust and trusteeship between central IT departments and functional departments. Lyytinen, Kalle analyzed how the ERP system has been successfully implemented in two recently established independent university groups. For political and functional reasons, ERP is used to replace some traditional student management systems. New university project consultants and management believe it is successful, while users are marginalized (black box), using traditional methods, such as shadow system and shift, to pick up fragments of an incomplete system. By using the process method and the theory of participating in network, this paper interprets the relevant social technology events, reveals how the three participating networks of management, project team, and management users collide and affect the implementation effect, and how the management and project network establish ERP as a reliable alliance. These users are marginalized when they join the network.Based on the analysis of enterprise information resource management in e-commerce environment, the idea of \"three networks\" + \"three systems\" enterprise three-dimensional information resource management is put forward, and the definition of enterprise three-dimensional"
"of enterprise information resource management in e-commerce environment, the idea of \"three networks\" + \"three systems\" enterprise three-dimensional information resource management is put forward, and the definition of enterprise three-dimensional information resource management is given. In addition, this paper also analyzes the three-dimensional enterprise information resource management platform Internet, intranet, extranet, and management system ERP, SCM, and CRM system management network and analyzes the differences between them from the management content and implementation of the key issues. The simulation test is carried out for the specific information resource management. The simulation information resource management environment and the method of statistical test information are used. The experimental results show that in 2019, the investment of e-commerce enterprises in hardware products decreased by 3.3%, and the proportion of software and information services increased by 2% and 1.3%.2. Proposed Method2.1. Information Resource ManagementThe information generated by enterprises in related enterprises such as operation, technology research and development, production, management, and marketing is collectively referred to as enterprise information resources [7]. These corporate information resources can greatly improve the development of the company, leading other companies in the same industry [8]. It is also an enterprise information technology application,"
"referred to as enterprise information resources [7]. These corporate information resources can greatly improve the development of the company, leading other companies in the same industry [8]. It is also an enterprise information technology application, network integration, business application system, network portal system, e-commerce system, and related hardware equipment [9]. These types of software have different functions and can be perfectly integrated. In addition, enterprise information resources technical personnel and information resource users, the former is the collection and processing of resource information, while the latter is the main operator of resource information and a collection of related information work resources [10].The task of enterprise information resource management is to effectively collect, acquire and process information inside and outside the enterprise, maximize the quality, availability, and value of enterprise information resources, and make all parts of the enterprise share these information resources. Information resource management is based on a certain organizational structure or organizational model of information resource management. The research of enterprise information resource management can be divided into three categories: the first category is oriented to specific business scenarios and industry fields; the second category is industry oriented; the third category is characterized by technology [11].

"management can be divided into three categories: the first category is oriented to specific business scenarios and industry fields; the second category is industry oriented; the third category is characterized by technology [11]. Among them, the first category can be used in banking, finance, Internet, and other industries; the second category can be used in education, sports, and other industries; and the third category can be used in related technology industries, such as machinery and manufacturing [12]. Research on specific business scenarios and industries can be divided into application research, which needs to rely on specific information resources for analysis and design.2.2. Enterprise Information Resource Management Model Based on e-Commercee-Commerce will change the relationship between enterprises and consumers and will bring new value opportunities and challenges [13]. Therefore, we can start from the perspective of corporate management and use different models according to the company′s strategic positioning, scientific management foundation, and business management process [14]. Different e-commerce models will bring different values and requirements to corporate management [15].2.2.1. Utility Value of Enterprise Information ResourcesThe value of enterprise information resources lies in the improvement of production and decision-making efficiency, as well as the dissemination of information, the elimination of uncertainty and the effectiveness of production."
"Information ResourcesThe value of enterprise information resources lies in the improvement of production and decision-making efficiency, as well as the dissemination of information, the elimination of uncertainty and the effectiveness of production. The value characteristics and laws of enterprise information resources can be described from the audience and richness:(1)Among them,Nis the audience of enterprise information resources andHis the richness of enterprise information resources.Valuevinfis a combination of two dependent variablesNandh, both of which are positively correlated.

Basic Principles of Building the Enterprise Information Resource Management Model Based on e-CommerceIn the daily management of an enterprise, the management level of an enterprise mainly depends on its organizational status [16]. A company with a good organizational level will have a benign development; otherwise, it will cause a vicious circle [17]. This is also determined by the organization's status [18]. Enterprise management gets rid of the subjective and arbitrary management stage, and the basic requirement for realizing e-commerce is to be more procedural and"
"will cause a vicious circle [17]. This is also determined by the organization's status [18]. Enterprise management gets rid of the subjective and arbitrary management stage, and the basic requirement for realizing e-commerce is to be more procedural and scientific [19]. The organizational environment will become more complex and changeable with the development of e-commerce. Therefore, the management level of enterprises has an important impact on the development of e-commerce. The following principles should be followed in the construction of enterprise information resource management mode based on e-commerce:(1)The principle of good faith is that business managers should recognize that the management object is an organic whole of rules composed of several parts. It requires all market participants to obtain benefits without harming the interests of others and social welfare. It must also follow the rules of business managers. See established rules in [20]. Business management is a comprehensive project. We must consider the integration of production, supply, and marketing and fully consider the internal network environment of the enterprise, in order to get the appropriate management mode.(2)The historical principle is one of the principles that have been followed from ancient times to the present [21]. When constructing the historical principle, we must consider the original system, the halfway development process, and the future development trend, so that the actual"
"one of the principles that have been followed from ancient times to the present [21]. When constructing the historical principle, we must consider the original system, the halfway development process, and the future development trend, so that the actual operation can be carried out well, and the development of the new model can also follow the changing trend of the times. It can be roughly carried out using historical principles and understood according to the laws of the original system in the process of formation and development, so as to prepare for the future development of the system [22].(3)The principle of sharing is to share data in accordance with specific application scenarios. It can give full play to the potential value of corporate information and maximize corporate information management. Sharing under the new model can realize the use of information in different systems as a whole [23]. On the other hand, we must pay attention to the security of information sharing.(4)The security principle is that the information must not be leaked in the enterprise, and the information security of the enterprise has always been the most concerned issue of all parties. Therefore, when constructing a new model [24], the security of enterprise information must be considered. This is also a key part of the entire system and is the basis and guarantee for subsequent development [25].2.4. Construction of the Enterprise Information Resource Management Model Based on e-CommerceThe"
"of enterprise information must be considered. This is also a key part of the entire system and is the basis and guarantee for subsequent development [25].2.4. Construction of the Enterprise Information Resource Management Model Based on e-CommerceThe realization of e-commerce needs the support of a powerful e-commerce system. A perfect e-commerce system includes two parts: front end and back end. The front-end system is mainly a trading system for customer groups and suppliers, including accepting customer orders, sending orders to suppliers, and realizing online transactions and payments. The back-end system mainly realizes the information flow of enterprise sales and purchase. Manage business process, logistics, and capital flow effectively and timely. The backstage system mainly relies on the construction of internal information system. At present, some enterprises have created the e-commerce mode, but without the inventory information, production information, purchase information, transportation information, and customer information provided by the background information system; the front e-commerce platform cannot obtain relevant information. Secondly, it cannot deal with the market information in time and effectively, which leads to the disconnection between the front desk and the back office, the decrease of customer satisfaction, and the loss of customer base. It can be seen that enterprise informatization should be the premise of establishing e-commerce. Only by"
"which leads to the disconnection between the front desk and the back office, the decrease of customer satisfaction, and the loss of customer base. It can be seen that enterprise informatization should be the premise of establishing e-commerce. Only by realizing the comprehensive informatization can enterprises develop e-commerce more effectively. Enterprises can establish the foreground system of e-commerce and the background system of internal supply chain management including sales and purchase. Through the coordination and control of the front and back offices, the effective management of the enterprise and the rational allocation and utilization of resources are realized. On this basis, the innovation of enterprise information resource management mode based on e-commerce is further realized. With the development of the Internet from a scientific network to a platform for business activities, the business activities of enterprises have broken through the limitation of time and space and changed the business activities and the way of value creation of enterprises. Therefore, based on the integration of the three systems, the application of e-commerce system must be increased. Through the e-commerce platform, the relationship between enterprises and customers can be extended to the whole network. Starting from meeting the key customers and appropriate customer needs, relying on the automatic management system, the comprehensive optimization of information flow, and"
"between enterprises and customers can be extended to the whole network. Starting from meeting the key customers and appropriate customer needs, relying on the automatic management system, the comprehensive optimization of information flow, and logistics can be realized. Optimize the service flow and capital flow of each node enterprise and the enterprise, so as to realize the rapid development of the enterprise.As shown in Figure1, e-commerce provides a faster channel and platform for enterprises to obtain information. ERP is the basis of internal operation and management of the system enterprise. Supply chain management provides a fast and flexible supply chain for enterprises. CRM helps enterprises realize the marketing mode of personalized service. The four are interrelated and influence each other. e-Commerce can solve the space-time problem of information transmission. ERP emphasizes the optimization of internal resources. It takes internal supply chain management as the core. Supply chain management is an effective management of all aspects of the supply chain. It enables the supply chain to cross departments, cross enterprises, and form a business process with products or services as the core. Considering supply chain management from the perspective of the whole society, we can improve the competitiveness of all enterprises in the supply chain and make enterprises move towards cooperative competition.

"management from the perspective of the whole society, we can improve the competitiveness of all enterprises in the supply chain and make enterprises move towards cooperative competition. The value of CRM lies in highlighting the importance of customer service and support, marketing management and other aspects from the perspective of improving customer relationship, and improving the competitiveness and profits of enterprises in the Internet environment, as shown in Table1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointEnterprise information resource management model based on e-commerce.Table  1.Difference comparison of ERP, CRM, and SCM.EASManagement contentKey issues of implementationERPProduction plan, material requirement plan, purchase plan, sales plan, utility plan, financial cost control plan, and human resource plan.The key to solve this problem is to integrate and optimize the resources within the enterprise. The idea of implementing supply chain management in the enterprise reduces the cost from the aspect of enterprise production process and improves the competitiveness and profit of the enterprise.CRMCustomer centered, including basic functions such as sales, marketing and customer service support, focusing on the effective exploration and utilization of customer resources by enterprises.Focusing on increasing customer value, it can effectively meet the personalized needs of customers, increase sales from the aspect of customer relationship, and improve the response"

The purpose of Intranet construction is to help the production department, sales department, financial department, and human resource department communicate more conveniently and reliably, cooperate with each other in purchasing, marketing, assessment, and other work, and use intranet to realize the information data sharing of ERP, SCM, and CRM.

"by employees in the intranet to promote department collaboration. As the basis of the implementation of enterprise information resource strategy, this level can improve the basic operation efficiency of enterprises, greatly reduce the economic cost of various functional departments in enterprise activities, and increase output.The second layer is the enterprise external network. Enterprise extranet is mainly aimed at the suppliers, distributors, and logistics distribution centers in the supply chain to realize the efficient operation of information flow, capital flow and logistics between the production enterprises and the final consumers. The enterprise terminal provides external interface and external network, and the interface is connected with the internal network to form a cooperative network system among partners. All business activities of the enterprise are carried out on the Internet, including online consultation, product ordering, product bargaining, and payment transaction. The real-time control of information improves the control of the enterprise, reduces the cost in the process of business activities, and achieves the purpose of reducing inventory. The integration and cooperation of enterprises in the supply chain has greatly improved the competitive advantage of enterprises in the industry.The third layer is the Internet-based enterprise e-commerce network.

"chain has greatly improved the competitive advantage of enterprises in the industry.The third layer is the Internet-based enterprise e-commerce network. It is supported by Internet technology, directly connected with the Internet, through e-commerce operation enterprise network, involving product sales and user service business network. In e-commerce network, enterprises use online mode to provide sales services for customers. At the same time, they can collect a large number of customer registration information and establish a special user recommendation system to gain competitive advantage. In addition, government agencies, banking institutions, and other social organizations should be included in the e-commerce network to provide policy and means support for online business activities of enterprises. The foundation of e-commerce is the establishment of information society. Therefore, the interaction between enterprises and social organizations can improve the utilization rate of social resources and promote the progress of the whole social economy.The internal and external network construction is to solve the need of enterprise information confidentiality.

On the one hand, the construction of three-layer network can ensure the external security of enterprise information; on the other hand, it can realize the internal information sharing.Enterprise information resource sharing is the key to an enterprise. It refers to the full discovery, mining, processing, and integration of information obtained in the internal and external environments of the enterprise, and the use of information to optimize the allocation of enterprise resources to realize its specific value and to improve production and operation to a certain extent. Efficiency can also promote a virtuous circle of enterprises. Because the enterprise is in a crisscross network environment, while sharing information, it may cause the leakage of business secrets and reduce the core competitiveness of the enterprise. Therefore, the contradiction between ensuring the internal information security of enterprises and realizing the information sharing among enterprises is the problem faced by the development of enterprises.3.

"of enterprises and realizing the information sharing among enterprises is the problem faced by the development of enterprises.3. Experiments3.1. Experimental Data CollectionBased on the establishment of a new model of enterprise information resource management, this paper conducts a simulation test on the specific information resource management. In the experiment, the method of simulating the information resource management environment was used to investigate the IT investment product structure of e-commerce companies from 2017 to 2019, and the test results were counted. It was found that the product structure was gradually improved during a few years, and various indicators also increased. Quickly, the new model proposed in this paper can be well verified. In the research process, this paper uses case enterprise information resource management related information resources to collect through the crawler program.3.2.

Each business unit focuses on profit, develops, produces, sells, and serves related products, and is responsible for profit and group investment. The headquarters operate in a unified way in investment decision-making, strategic planning, capital operation, and supervision.3.3. Case Enterprise StructureIn the supply chain system, enterprises can be divided into three levels: core level enterprises, close level enterprises, and loose level enterprises. The core level enterprises are mainly to formulate enterprise strategic planning and coordinate the relationship with upstream and downstream partners. Close layer enterprises are the close partner enterprises of enterprises, which reflect the common competitiveness of the supply chain, mainly involving the key technologies that have a greater impact on enterprises, but the number of close layer enterprises should be moderate. Loose layer enterprises have great mobility, involving general technology and product outsourcing, and its loss will not cause a big blow to enterprises.

The total software investment of e-commerce enterprises is 18.34 billion yuan, accounting for 19.4% of the Department's IT investment. The total information service investment is 12.67 billion yuan, accounting for 13.4% of the Department's IT investment.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointIT investment product structure of e-commerce enterprises.Compared with 2018, the investment in hardware products of e-commerce enterprises decreased by 3.3% in 2019, and the proportion of software and information services increased by 2% and 1.3%, respectively. With the maturity of IT service market, the demand of e-commerce enterprises for services has greatly increased. Outsourcing services (ASP) and IT consulting services are gradually accepted by more and more customers.4.2.

"based on the internal network of the enterprise includes information interaction between employees, functional departments, and other related organizations. However, the realization of enterprise information resource sharing within the enterprise is often limited by the enterprise software and hardware environment, which will cause information exchange between enterprises. Among them, the hard environment refers to the organizational structure of the enterprise, while the centralized management adopts the traditional pyramid organizational structure, which is not conducive to the smooth transmission of enterprise information and seriously reduces the sharing efficiency of internal information; the soft environment refers to the organizational culture of the enterprise, and the key to promote the innovation of knowledge management is whether the enterprise has the incentive trust association of employees.Information resource sharing involves data exchange, authorized access, system research and development, system maintenance, e-commerce, and other fields. Data exchange technology is the main support for enterprises to realize information sharing. At present, there are two common ways of data exchange in enterprises: centralized and distributed.As shown in Figure4, intranet-based enterprises adopt centralized data exchange. In the establishment of a shared database in an enterprise, internal information resources can be stored in the database for internal personnel to access"
"and distributed.As shown in Figure4, intranet-based enterprises adopt centralized data exchange. In the establishment of a shared database in an enterprise, internal information resources can be stored in the database for internal personnel to access and query data. Among them, centralized data exchange is widely used. The advantages of centralized data exchange include high access efficiency, centralized management, complete data, consistent structure standards, and strong real-time performance. The disadvantages of centralized data exchange are as follows: it cannot meet the requirements of the rapid growth of data volume brought about by the future development of enterprises.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointCentralized data exchange.Intranet-based enterprise information resources are distributed in different business databases. Distributed data exchange can transfer information resources between enterprises through exchange nodes. It not only creates conditions for real-time information exchange, remote access, and scale expansion but also helps enterprises reduce the risk of system implementation. But its disadvantage is that the efficiency of network transmission will affect the efficiency of data access and exchange, as shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistributed data exchange.4.2.1. Enterprise Information Resource Sharing Based on ExtranetThe reason that affects the realization of enterprise information resource sharing based on extranet"
"as shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointDistributed data exchange.4.2.1. Enterprise Information Resource Sharing Based on ExtranetThe reason that affects the realization of enterprise information resource sharing based on extranet is that the relevant technology level is not up to the requirements, or the integrity of resource visitors is low. In the past, because of the low information transfer rate and the easy distortion of information, enterprises often made wrong production and inventory plans. In order to eliminate these negative effects, the concept of information resource sharing in supply chain came into being. The improvement of enterprise production efficiency, operation speed, and knowledge innovation all depend on the sharing of enterprise information resources based on extranet. In the supply chain, the key to realize knowledge innovation lies in the integration of knowledge among enterprises, the promotion of information sharing, the optimization of resource allocation, the continuous innovation, and the minimization of production cost, so as to enhance the common competitive advantage of enterprises and realize the maximization of enterprises. The common interests of chain enterprises are as follows. Of course, information resource sharing based on the Internet inevitably brings information security risks.

"follows. Of course, information resource sharing based on the Internet inevitably brings information security risks. If the enterprises in the chain violate the principle of cooperation and trust, the sharing of enterprise information resources will not continue.A hybrid data exchange method is used in the enterprise, which combines the advantages of both centralized data exchange and distributed data exchange. The advantages of centralized data exchange and access are high in efficiency and real time, and distributed data exchange reduces risks and remote access. Using the combination of two methods to realize the sharing of information resources based on the external network, its core lies in data storage according to the importance of information. Information with high degree of sharing and strong openness can be stored in a centralized way, and core business data with strong independence can be stored in a decentralized way. It can not only access and exchange the data in the shared database but also provide direct access and exchange access through the central node as shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointHybrid data exchange.4.2.2.

"information of enterprises is usually protected by strict security measures, while the core technology and professional knowledge are regarded as business secrets of enterprises. The correct strategic planning of an enterprise depends on the real-time exchange of safe and reliable information. On the Internet, different enterprises have different information systems, different structures, and different exchange requirements. Therefore, the Internet-based enterprise information resource sharing should adopt the central exchange node and comprehensive mixed data exchange mode. The internal information demander exchanges data with the department database through the exchange subnodes of each business unit and then through the central exchange node of the cooperative enterprise. The department database uploads the relevant information to the supply chain enterprise central database to realize the core information sharing. The external information demander can only access the central database sharing through its own subnode public basic information resources. The child node can directly access the other's child nodes through the central node, so as to obtain some information that is not convenient to be widely disclosed in the central database. The information resources of public basic enterprises are stored in the central database.

"central database. The information resources of public basic enterprises are stored in the central database. For some information resources that need to be kept secret, personal management should be implemented accordingly, and the way of personal subnode exchange through the central node should be adopted. The mixed data exchange mode can provide information monitoring, record exchange logs, and other functions, which can help to deal with failures, solve postevent responsibility identification and other issues, and promote the improvement of social supervision mechanism.5. ConclusionsAt present, enterprise information resource management in e-commerce environment has become one of the key and hot issues in the field of information resource management. As an important branch of information resource management, the research of enterprise three-dimensional information resource management mode in e-commerce environment has not shown any special literature, let alone the review and summary of existing research. Especially in information resource management, Internet/intranet/extranet technology, e-commerce, and other fields, there is a lack of comprehensive integration.

"AbstractIn recent years, with the development of science and technology, as an emerging data security technology, blockchain has been widely used in all walks of life by virtue of its immutability, uniqueness, smart contract, and decentralized organization. Examples include industry, services, and education. With the progress of China's education, the application of blockchain technology in the field of education has also been further expanded. At present, the application of blockchain in China's education field is mainly concentrated in three areas: education resource management, teaching information management, and education basic platform construction. This article aims to study the security of the student information management system based on the blockchain. The security test experiment of the student information management system is carried out based on the encryption algorithm of the blockchain, and conclusions are drawn. The security of the student information management system based on the encryption algorithm of blockchain technology has increased by 87%, which also shows that the blockchain technology has a better effect on improving the security of the student information management system.1.

"era, with the improvement of social science and technology and the development of education, education and teaching are becoming more and more intelligent and informatized. Educational informatization refers to the application of modern information technology to teaching management and scientific research and pays attention to the development and utilization of educational information resources. Educational intelligence and informatization have greatly improved the efficiency of the teaching process and the ability to manage and share educational resources, thereby continuously promoting the continuous development of education. However, in the process of informatization teaching and educational resource management, a large amount of information about education, teaching, and personal privacy of students will be involved. If the information is stored and managed improperly, it will lead to the leakage of important information in the education and teaching process and the leakage of students' personal privacy. This will have a huge negative impact on the education and teaching process and the protection of student privacy, and it will also pose a certain threat to the entire education and social security. Therefore, in a modern society where privacy protection issues are increasingly prominent, there is an urgent need for a system technology that combines security, reliability, and privacy protection.

"a modern society where privacy protection issues are increasingly prominent, there is an urgent need for a system technology that combines security, reliability, and privacy protection. It reasonably protects and manages important education and teaching information and student privacy information involved in the process of education and teaching informatization. The blockchain is a data structure that links some important related information and data blocks in chronological order. It was first applied in the Bitcoin field. Since the birth of Bitcoin in 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has had thousands of distributed nodes around the world, and it has been running uninterruptedly for nearly 10 years without major security breaches. Although blockchain technology originated from encrypted digital currency, its development and application are not limited to the financial field. It can be widely used in many aspects and fields such as culture and entertainment, social welfare, and data protection. Because the blockchain combines technologies and algorithms such as economic design, cryptographic encryption algorithms, and distributed network technology, it can ensure the integrity, reliability, uncodable modification, and uniqueness of information and data on the blockchain, thereby ensuring maximum protection of private data security.

These characteristics and advantages of blockchain technology make it also have a certain application value in the education field, and it is more widely used in the education industry and other industries.The application value of blockchain technology in various fields has caused a lot of research on blockchain technology to emerge in academia. For example, Miraz and Ali's research puts forward that blockchain technology is the key supporting technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, and blockchain technology also plays a vital role in other application fields that need to ensure the security of private data. Therefore, their research mainly tested and evaluated the actual application effects of the blockchain plan in various fields and found that the blockchain technology has good application effects in various fields [1]. Yeoh studied the technical regulatory challenges of blockchain technology in the EU and the United States.

"said to be a distributed ledger that shares data between points in a peer-to-peer network [7]. Blockchain itself is not a brand-new technology but a combination of a variety of existing technologies, involving cryptography, probability theory, consensus mechanism, and distributed network as well as other computer technologies. The nodes in the distributed network of the blockchain jointly maintain public data in a trustless and decentralized manner. There can be any number of nodes in the blockchain, and each node needs to follow the same consensus mechanism to continuously generate new blocks at a certain time interval. Each new block joined together creates a new chain of information. During this time, the data records in the blockchain will be stored there. There are many kinds of blockchain consensus mechanisms, and the working methods of blockchains of different consensus mechanisms are quite different. The blockchain consists of a series of blocks connected in sequence. These blocks contain a timestamp and are connected by the hash value of the previous block. The cleverly designed block structure based on cryptography ensures that the block is sealed in a safe and unsealed way [8,9]. The blockchain structure is shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.1.2.

"shown in Figure1.Open in figure viewerPowerPoint2.1.2. Blockchain ClassificationBlockchains can be divided into public chains, private chains, and consortium chains according to their nature and usage [10,11]. The data in the public chain are open to the public. Anyone in the public chain can participate in the data consensus process and can act as a simple node or absentee node. The private chain is controlled by an organization, and the centralized manager determines the role and management authority of the node. The private chain information is not public, and only a small number of internal relevant personnel can see and use it. The consortium chain is between the public chain and the private chain. Some preselected nodes participate in the data consensus process of the consortium chain. The members of the consortium chain have specific access rights and are jointly maintained by several organizations [12,13].

Blockchain Technology WorkflowBlockchain combines a variety of existing technologies [14,15] to implement logic applications by creating and updating data, sending data between nodes, using automated script codes, or using smart contracts. If traditional databases can only maintain data security unilaterally, then blockchain can maintain data security in an all-round way. The blockchain workflow mainly includes three steps: block generation, consensus verification, and ledger maintenance, forming a complete blockchain operation process.2.2. Blockchain Encryption AlgorithmWhen the blockchain applicant has computing needs, the requester sends a computing request to the applicant. Then the applicant requests the kernel and auxiliary components to calculate the feedback value and secretly sends the feedback value to the requester [16,17]. The applicant uses the verification key to determine the validity of the feedback value. After receivingnvalid feedback values, the correct calculation result can be obtained.The first step is initialization.Fais a finite field characterized bya.

"on Blockchain3.1. Experimental MethodThe main method of this experiment is as follows: First, select some academic data to form an academic information model for the ordinary student information management system A that does not incorporate blockchain technology, and conduct a security test on it. Then, the student information management system of the same academic information model is combined with blockchain-based data protection technology and encryption algorithm to encrypt the information and then perform the system security test [18,19]. Finally, the comparison is made and the experimental results are obtained.3.2. Security Test of General Student Information Management System AFirst, randomly select a part of the data from a large amount of academic data to build an academic information model. As the security test model of this ordinary student information management system, this article uses the security test model of the student information management system of blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithm. The selected academic data are shown in Table2.2.Academic data.Field nameTypeEncryption methodStudent IDStringSymmetric encryptionNameStringSymmetric encryptionMajorStringSymmetric encryptionEntity IDStringSymmetric encryptionPhoneStringSymmetric encryptionAfter the model is established, we will start to test the security of the ordinary student information management system A.

"IDStringSymmetric encryptionPhoneStringSymmetric encryptionAfter the model is established, we will start to test the security of the ordinary student information management system A. The security test of the student information management system includes two aspects: one is the relationship between the length of the login password and the security of the account; the other is the evaluation of the difficulty of reading and transferring account information [20]. Next, we first test the relationship between the length of the login password of the student information management system A and the account security. The test results are shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe next step is to determine the degree of difficulty of reading and transferring account information in system A. The result is shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFrom Figures3and4, we can first see that the account security of system A is directly proportional to the length of the password. It shows that the account security of system A is closely related to the length of the login password. The longer the password, the stronger the account security. This situation is also in line with the actual system situation. Second, we can also see that as the number of readings of information increases, the amount of information read is also increasing.

"situation. Second, we can also see that as the number of readings of information increases, the amount of information read is also increasing. Moreover, with the increase in the number of times of information transfer, although the amount of transferred information has not increased much, it is also showing an increasing trend. These phenomena show that the difficulty of reading and transferring information in system A is not great, and the difficulty coefficient of transferring information is slightly higher. However, users can read and transfer more information easily by continuously reading and transferring. In summary, although the ordinary student information management system A has a certain degree of security, it is not very safe. Under this system, the security of the account is easily affected by the length of the password, and it is easier to read and transfer account information.3.3. Security Test of Student Information Management System B Using Blockchain TechnologyNext, we will conduct a security test of the student information management system B using blockchain data security technology. First of all, based on the same academic data model in Table2, we combined it with blockchain technology and used the blockchain encryption algorithm to encrypt the important data in the system. Then update the system and retest the relationship between the account security of the new system B and the length of the login password, as well as the account information read and"
"encryption algorithm to encrypt the important data in the system. Then update the system and retest the relationship between the account security of the new system B and the length of the login password, as well as the account information read and transfer difficulty coefficient evaluation. The test results of the relationship between the account security and the password length of the student information management system B using blockchain technology are shown in Figure5.Open in figure viewerPowerPointFrom Figure5, we can see that the account security of the new student information management system B after the use of blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithms also has a certain proportional relationship with the length of the password. But, unlike system A, the account security and password length of system B do not maintain a proportional relationship from beginning to end. But when the password length reaches 6 characters, the account security will no longer increase as the password length changes. This shows that there is a fixed restricted value between account security and password length in the student information management system based on blockchain technology. That is, the account login password is required to be at least 6 digits. If this requirement is met, the security of the account is no longer affected by the length of the password but has always maintained stable security.Next is the evaluation of the difficulty coefficient of reading and"
"is required to be at least 6 digits. If this requirement is met, the security of the account is no longer affected by the length of the password but has always maintained stable security.Next is the evaluation of the difficulty coefficient of reading and transferring account information of system B. The evaluation results are shown in Figure6.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFrom Figure6, we can see that the difficulty of reading and transferring account information in the new student information management system that uses blockchain data security technology is limited. That is, when the number of times of information reading and dumping reaches a certain value, the amount of information read and dumped is a fixed value and no longer changes. This shows that blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithms restrict the reading and transfer of account information in system B. When the number of reads and the number of transfers reaches a certain value, the system will automatically determine that the amount of account information read and transfer has reached the limit value. If it continues to extract and transfer, the system will determine that the account is at risk at this time and then encrypt and block the account information so that the user can no longer continue to extract and transfer the information of this account [21]. Therefore, when the blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithm are combined, the security"
"then encrypt and block the account information so that the user can no longer continue to extract and transfer the information of this account [21]. Therefore, when the blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithm are combined, the security of the new student information management system is greatly improved. After the evaluation data conversion calculation, the security of the student information management system B based on blockchain technology is 87% higher than that of the ordinary student information management system A that does not apply blockchain technology.In summary, the conclusion of this experiment is that the security of the student information management system based on blockchain technology is 87% higher than that of the ordinary student information management system that does not apply blockchain technology. This conclusion shows that blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithms have good application effects for the security and improvement of student information management systems.3.4. Experimental SummaryAt this point, the entire experimental process is complete. Finally, let us summarize this experiment. This experiment is based on the common student information management system A based on the same academic data model and the new student information management system B that combines blockchain data security technology.

"system A based on the same academic data model and the new student information management system B that combines blockchain data security technology. It tested the relationship between account security and password length and the difficulty of reading and transferring information to test the security of the two systems. The conclusion shows that the student information management system based on blockchain technology has high security. This experiment is relatively smooth on the whole and is proceeded step by step and finally reached effective conclusions. But we believe that this experiment still has room for improvement in terms of experimental methods and efficiency. It is hoped that future experiments can complete the experiment and draw conclusions with more standardized steps in a shorter time and at a faster speed.4.

"technical functions and technical advantages [22]. Therefore, blockchain technology has continued to develop and progress since its inception. Today, the scope of application in various fields is also expanding. The education neighborhood is an important field. In the process of informatization of education and teaching, such as the realization and application of student information management system, a reliable privacy protection technology is needed to protect a large amount of important education and teaching information and students' personal privacy information involved. Relying on its technical advantages, blockchain technology also has certain application value. This article assumes that the basic data storage protection and management technology of blockchain technology and the blockchain encryption algorithm have a certain effect on the security of the student information management system in the education field, and, based on this article, a security test experiment of student information management system based on blockchain is designed. In the experiment, blockchain technology and blockchain encryption algorithm are combined to evaluate the student information management system A that does not use blockchain technology and the student information management system B that uses blockchain technology.

The content includes the relationship between account security and the length of the login password, as well as the difficulty of reading and transferring information. Based on this, this article has tested the overall security of the two systems. Finally, this article compares the security of the student information management system that uses blockchain technology with the security of the student information management system that does not use blockchain technology and finds that the security of the student information management system that uses blockchain technology has increased by 87%. Such experimental results show that blockchain technology has a certain role in improving the security of student information management systems.5.

In the process of education informatization, computer technology, multimedia technology, big data, artificial intelligence, and network information technology will be fully used. Among them, it will inevitably involve a large amount of important education and teaching information and personal private information of students, and this information or data need to be properly stored and managed.

"student information. With the continuous development of China's education and the continuous increase of the country's investment in the field of education, the student information management system has been implemented and applied in all aspects of society. Since the process of student information management system will involve a large amount of education and teaching information about students and personal privacy information, a reliable data security technology must be combined to ensure the security of student information management system. The blockchain technology is a data security technology that links some important related information and data blocks in chronological order. It combines computer technology, economic design, cryptographic encryption algorithm, and distributed network technology and other technologies and algorithms and has strong data security management capabilities. Since its inception, blockchain technology has been used more and more widely in information security management in all walks of life.

"AbstractWith the gradual growth of economy, tourism has become a pillar industry in many countries and plays an important role in promoting national development. The individualization and diversification of tourism resources must be supported by a powerful information resource management system. However, the traditional tourism information resource management system has some problems, such as scattered sources of tourism information, low interactivity, and slow update of information resources. Tourists cannot get detailed information of scenic spots and make detailed plans for tourism which hinder the further development of the tourism industry.
