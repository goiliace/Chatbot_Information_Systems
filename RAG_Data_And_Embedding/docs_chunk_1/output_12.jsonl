"AbstractIn order to study the management and control ability of the government affairs 4.0 system on the logistics economic park and improve the data prediction and data early warning sensitivity of the economic management information system in the logistics economic park, this study recombs the basic model of the logistics economic park and puts forward the development model of the inward logistics economic park. Based on this model, a logistics economic big data system is built, and a data early warning model based on machine learning is designed. In the simulation verification, it is found that the original data demand of machine learning data early warning mode is smaller, the data sensitivity early warning cycle is longer, and the data early warning sensitivity is higher under the same conditions. Finally, it is considered that the machine learning linear programming algorithm model has high applicability in the government economic management process of inward logistics economic park.1.

Nonelectronic devices are built into network nodes by giving traceable bar codes to nonelectronic devices, and embedded devices or auxiliary devices are used to collect their physical location, asset value, operation status, responsible person, and other data into the Internet technology architecture in real time [1].

"and embedded devices or auxiliary devices are used to collect their physical location, asset value, operation status, responsible person, and other data into the Internet technology architecture in real time [1]. Logistics economic system (LES) is an economic driving model based on the logistics industry, extending the transaction and delivery of bulk materials, material consumption processing enterprises, logistics management, transportation, and other industries [2]. Make use of lower freight rates and more systematic and efficient transportation and storage system to promote the realization of large-scale processing industry added value (GDP in 2nd layer) in regional economy. Obviously, logistics enterprises are an important part of the national economy, which is closely related to people's daily work and life. In recent years, logistics enterprises have developed rapidly, and many technologies have been applied to logistics enterprises, and the Internet of Things technology is the most important one. Through the application of the Internet of Things technology, a complete logistics management system can be built to facilitate the query of logistics information.In relevant studies, the logistics economic management information system (LEMS) is defined as an information system that systematically manages the logistics market (including intercity transportation, local transportation and storage, and loading and unloading market), bulk material trading market, financial"
"system (LEMS) is defined as an information system that systematically manages the logistics market (including intercity transportation, local transportation and storage, and loading and unloading market), bulk material trading market, financial reports of processing enterprises, etc., under the government affairs 4.0 system [3]. The core development task of the early management information system is the SQL-related operation of the database, while the current development task of the management information system is more inclined to data curve estimation, data early warning, and so on.At present, there are three main problems in the field of logistics. First, the enterprise system needs to be improved. Many enterprises will face many problems before integration, especially in logistics management; there is a large amount of unaudited data. Second, the logistics management system needs to be updated. In the process of logistics information management, if computer technology is used unreasonably, various logistics management information is still sorted manually, which will cause serious adverse effects on the management quality and efficiency of logistics information. Third, the quality of management personnel needs to be improved. At present, the overall quality of the staff engaged in the logistics industry in China needs to be improved, and the computing skills of the staff are limited, which will have an impact on the development of the national logistics industry.The"
"improved. At present, the overall quality of the staff engaged in the logistics industry in China needs to be improved, and the computing skills of the staff are limited, which will have an impact on the development of the national logistics industry.The application of the Internet of Things technology in the logistics information management system is also reflected in the application of RFID. Through the application of RFID technology, the effective collection of information sources of different items can be realized, the information reading function can be automated, and the accuracy of various information data can be ensured. During logistics information management, RFID technology can accurately transmit the logistics information obtained in the process to every link involved in the logistics network to ensure the timeliness of logistics information.On October 5, 2021 (Beijing time), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the 2021 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Japanese American scientist Syukuro Manabe, German scientist Klaus Hasselmann, and Italian scientist Giorgio Parisi \"A pioneering contribution to our understanding of complex physical systems.\" After the introduction of the subject of operations research in the field of physics won the prize, the field of economics also began to carry out more active research on the subject of linear programming operation research of complex systems in economic description [4].

"research in the field of physics won the prize, the field of economics also began to carry out more active research on the subject of linear programming operation research of complex systems in economic description [4]. The LEMS system designed in this research takes the linear programming of operations research and complex system control as the core technical path, focuses on the application mode of relevant algorithms and analyzes its application effect.2. Mathematical Model Expression of Logistics EconomyThe logistics economy relies on the logistics system, but the main economies are processing enterprises and logistics service enterprises. The service roles include financial, insurance, and consulting enterprises. Assuming that there are only three roles in the economic zone, namely, production-oriented enterprises, logistics service enterprises, and financial service enterprises [5], the basic model of the logistics economic zone is shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointGeneral model of logistics economic zone from the perspective of regional economy.In Figure1, there are three major roles in the logistics economic park: ① the role of logistics enterprises providing logistics services and forming a bulk material delivery system, which includes transportation, handling, loading and unloading, warehousing, and other service industries in the logistics industry, as well as bulk material delivery, trading, commerce, and trade and other industries;"
"a bulk material delivery system, which includes transportation, handling, loading and unloading, warehousing, and other service industries in the logistics industry, as well as bulk material delivery, trading, commerce, and trade and other industries; ②processing enterprises that use bulk materials for processing and production and want to provide deep-processing bulk materials or batch terminal commodities to the market; and ③ financial institutions that provide supply chain financial services for the logistics process of bulk delivery transactions, commercial loans for enterprises in the park, property insurance and personal safety insurance for enterprises in the park, financial leasing of relevant vehicle equipment and steel frame structure facilities for enterprises in the park, or other financial services. The three roles are analyzed as follows:3. Logistics Enterprise PlateLogistics enterprises have formed the core competitiveness of logistics economic park, which belongs to the basic service plate of regional economic park. Among them, transportation, handling, loading and unloading, and warehousing enterprises provide basic services in the logistics enterprise sector, provide greater bulk material transportation support capacity for the regional economy, and provide lower freight rates for the regional economy, so as to greatly reduce the raw material cost of processing enterprises. Taking steel-making enterprises and chemical enterprises as examples, the logistics"
"capacity for the regional economy, and provide lower freight rates for the regional economy, so as to greatly reduce the raw material cost of processing enterprises. Taking steel-making enterprises and chemical enterprises as examples, the logistics cost accounts for 35~55% of their raw material cost. If the logistics cost decreases by 50%, the raw material cost will decrease by 17.5~27.5%, and the enterprises will have strong competitiveness in the global market [6].Liangshan Industrial Park in Jining, Shandong Province (coal washing and coal chemical industry), Baowu Industrial Park in Wuhan, Hubei Province (steelmaking and ironmaking), Yanghe Industrial Park in Suqian, Jiangsu Province (wine making and food processing), and other regional logistics economic industrial parks have established a logistics system integrating railways, expressways, inland rivers, and air transportation. Compared with the basic freight rate of 0.12~0.18 yuan per ton km in general areas in China, the basic freight rate of industrial enterprises is reduced to 0.02~0.04 yuan per ton km, saving 4~6 times the freight rate for local enterprises [7]. That is, the essence of logistics economic park is to solve the shortage of local bulk material resources and make the supply and marketing capacity of local bulk materials meet the production needs of local industrial enterprises. The logistics industry belongs to the service industry. The main source of productivity of the logistics economic park is the"
"and make the supply and marketing capacity of local bulk materials meet the production needs of local industrial enterprises. The logistics industry belongs to the service industry. The main source of productivity of the logistics economic park is the industrial processing enterprises rooted in the logistics industrial park.4. Processing Enterprise PlateFor example, according to the previous analysis, simply building an export-oriented logistics industrial park, that is, only centralized storage facilities and loading, unloading and transshipment facilities are arranged in the industrial park. By providing services to the surrounding areas, on the one hand, the local transportation lines are extended and the logistics advantages of the large-scale logistics industrial park are lost. On the other hand, it cannot directly promote the industrial added value of the local regional economy. It can only promote industrial development in nearby areas. That is, compared with the inward logistics industrial park, the outward logistics industrial park has the disadvantage of getting twice the result with half the effort [8]. The logistics hub is a core facility in the logistics industrial park, but it is necessary for the logistics industrial park to form an inward oriented economic model, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointGeneral model of inward logistics economic park.In Figure2, the traditional export-oriented logistics economic park only includes logistics"
"park to form an inward oriented economic model, as shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointGeneral model of inward logistics economic park.In Figure2, the traditional export-oriented logistics economic park only includes logistics hub and warehouse functions, that is, it provides logistics services to the surrounding areas by building a logistics service system, and its core part is generally a railway station, airport, or wharf. In the inward logistics economic park, the external logistics service function of warehouse is weakened, but large processing enterprises are directly integrated into the logistics system of the economic park, so that railway platforms, docks, and berths can directly go deep into the enterprise production system, greatly reducing the logistics cost of processing enterprises. Taking Yanghe Industrial Park as an example, there are hundreds of food processing enterprises and wine making enterprises above designated size in the park. The hundreds of thousands or even millions of tons of grain materials they need every year are directly unloaded from the wharf berth in the enterprise production system, and the processed products are directly loaded on the wharf berth in the enterprise production system. The system serves local production enterprises and directly drives the local industrial added value, rather than only providing the added value of service industry. Local regional economic indicators and fiscal revenue have been"
"production system. The system serves local production enterprises and directly drives the local industrial added value, rather than only providing the added value of service industry. Local regional economic indicators and fiscal revenue have been effectively promoted.5. Financial Institutions PlateFinancial institutions and logistics enterprises are basic service enterprises in the park. Logistics enterprises provide supply and marketing services for bulk materials, and financial institutions provide funds for the operation of logistics economic park. Because its supporting effect on economy is similar to that of logistics enterprises, it is not discussed here.6. Government Administration Task and Management Information System Design of Logistics Economic Park6.1. Data Acquisition and Data Warehouse Management ModeThe government management information system of the logistics economic park has three core management objectives [9]: ① Control statistics of the total tax-related flow amount of logistics enterprises, production enterprises, and financial service institutions in the park, in which the input flow of logistics enterprises and financial service institutions belongs to GDP in 3rd layer and the input flow of production enterprises belongs to GDP in 2nd layer. ② Ensure the continuous investment attraction in the park, increase the collection and payment capacity of land use tax, ensure the operating profits of settled enterprises, and increase the collection and"
"enterprises belongs to GDP in 2nd layer. ② Ensure the continuous investment attraction in the park, increase the collection and payment capacity of land use tax, ensure the operating profits of settled enterprises, and increase the collection and payment capacity of enterprise income tax. The increase of operating profits of settled enterprises will also stimulate the investment attraction. ③ Ensure the control of freight and increase the management of price management and other market order, so as to give full play to the advantages of the logistics economic park.In order to achieve the above management objectives, the system needs to build a series of data interfaces and a local data warehouse system to provide data resources for subsequent data analysis. The data interface structure is shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointLEMS system interface logic architecture.In Figure3, at least 8 dynamic program interfaces (APIs) are used to realize the data import of the system data warehouse. The data driver selects the logical database dBASE software system. Because all data comes from the synchronous interface of the third-party system, there is no permanent data sequential backup system in the system. The core function of the system is to integrate the synchronous data of multiple external systems for data analysis. Data synchronization is a one-way process and does not write back data to relevant systems, so the API interface is a one-way synchronization"
"core function of the system is to integrate the synchronous data of multiple external systems for data analysis. Data synchronization is a one-way process and does not write back data to relevant systems, so the API interface is a one-way synchronization interface [10]. The following will focus on the analysis of data analysis algorithms.6.2. Linear Programming and Index Factor Control AlgorithmIf the objective function of linear regression isy=bx+a, there is the following expression for factoraand factorb[11], as shown in formula (1).(1)wherexiandyiare theXandYcoordinates of theith scatter point to be regressed;is the mean of allxvalues and allyvalues;bis the slope of regression function;ais the intercept of regression function;nis the number of scatter points to be regressed.The mean valuein the formula is the arithmetic mean value [12], as shown in formula (3).(2)Among (2), the meaning of mathematical symbols is the same as formula (1).Coefficient of determination (R2) is an important statistic reflecting the goodness of fit of the model, which is the ratio of regression square difference to total square difference, as shown in formula (3).(3)whereR2is the coefficient of determination (R2),is the mean value ofXorY, andis the mean value of regression results corresponding toXorY. The above two mean values are calculated by the arithmetic mean method, with reference to formula (2) above [13] Other mathematical symbols have the same meaning as formula (1) above.When linear"
"the mean value of regression results corresponding toXorY. The above two mean values are calculated by the arithmetic mean method, with reference to formula (2) above [13] Other mathematical symbols have the same meaning as formula (1) above.When linear regression is applied to linear programming, slopeband control factorR2are key factors, especially when multiple linear regression result functions are superimposed into state space functions, whenbis positive, it is an upward trend, whenbis negative, it is a downward trend, whenR2> 0.900, it is a strong data correlation, and whenR2> 0.700, it is a credible correlation. The system judges the relevance of multiple linear regression result functions through machine learning. Intercepta, slopeb, and control factorR2shall be introduced as input variables, weighted, and imported into the machine learning judgment module, and the output risk estimation value shall be used as the control variable of data early warning. This method is more reliable than the early state space method. The algorithm logic is shown in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointArchitecture of machine learning algorithm for linear programming.In Figure4, the key technologies are weighting algorithm module and neural network module.

"module and neural network module. The technical details are discussed below:(1)Weighting algorithm moduleThe weighting module is divided into two calculation steps. Firstly, all data are normalized to adjust the range of falling point value range to the [0,1] interval. AlthoughR2value itself is in the [0,1] interval, the actual results are generally concentrated in [0.6,1] interval, so it is also necessary to use the normalization formula for linear reprojection sorting. For theavalue,bvalue, andR2value of all lines, calculate the maximum and minimum values, respectively, calculate the differenceMbetween the maximum and minimum values, and calculate the differenceNbetween each specific value and the minimum value. Then, calculate the ratio ofN/M, which is the result value of linear reprojection [14], as shown in formula (4).(4)wherexis the set of all input values. When the input value is the set ofavalues, it is the set of all a values. Similarly, calculate the value ofborR2;yiis the re projection result value;xiis theith input value; min (x) is the minimum value ofXset; max (x) is the maximum value ofXset.After completing the above normalization calculation, the falling point ranges ofavalue,bvalue, andR2value corresponding to each line are equally distributed in the [0,1] interval. According to the data importance, multiply the output results of allbvalues by 10 to adjust the falling point range of their value range to the [0,10] interval, multiply the output results of"
"to each line are equally distributed in the [0,1] interval. According to the data importance, multiply the output results of allbvalues by 10 to adjust the falling point range of their value range to the [0,10] interval, multiply the output results of allavalues by 1 to keep them in the [0,1] interval, and multiply the output results of allR2values by 6. Adjust the falling point range of its value range to [0,6]. At this time, the weighting calculation process is completed.(2)Neural network moduleThe statistical significance of fuzzy convolution neural network is to fuse multiple columns of data into one output data. The output data is in double precision format. The output data reflects all the information of the input data with the support of depth iterative regression algorithm and purposefully amplifies the data information to be displayed. In this study, in order to judge the convergence degree of neural network in data training, all output data landing points are required to focus on the [0,1] interval. When the data is close to 1.000, it is considered that there is data risk; when the data is close to 0.000, it is considered that there is no data risk. In relevant references [15], polynomial depth iterative regression function is generally used as the node basis function of neural network, and its function expression is shown in formula (5).(5)whereyis the node output value,xiis the input value transmitted from theith node of the previous layer to the node,Ajis the"
"function is generally used as the node basis function of neural network, and its function expression is shown in formula (5).(5)whereyis the node output value,xiis the input value transmitted from theith node of the previous layer to the node,Ajis the coefficient to be regressed of thejth-order polynomial,jis polynomial order, andNis the number of nodes of the previous neural network.7. Simulation Verification of Machine Learning Algorithm for Linear ProgrammingThe basic purpose of the linear programming algorithm designed above is to predict and warn the enterprise loss, freight rate rise, credit events, etc., that is, the output value of the fuzzy convolution neural network finally output by formula (5) above is within different value ranges, and the occurrence probability of the above three early warning results needs to be verified. The comparison group uses the traditional prediction results based on state space (simple line function superposition). The simulation environment is built in Python big data analysis software, and the data comes from the actual operation data of Jiangsu Yanghe logistics park, Shandong Liangshan logistics park, and Hubei Baowu Industrial Park from 2019 to 2020 [16]. See Table1for analysis results.Table  1.Comparison of model early warning sensitivity.Algorithm typeEarly warning resultsEnterprise lossFreight rate riseCredit eventMachine learning>0.90076.384.595.2>0.70069.872.983.6State space>0.90071.579.291.8>0.70061.264.776.6In Table1, under"

Due to space constraints, the similarities and differences of the above three early warning algorithms are not discussed here, but the comparison results directly reflect the data sensitivity gap between linear programming using machine learning and linear programming using traditional state space. Whether the early warning result is >0.900 or >0.700, the machine learning algorithm shows great advantages. It is proved that the algorithm efficiency of using linear programming algorithm to manage inward logistics economic park in this study has stronger applicability.The biggest disadvantage of linear programming is to predict the data of one cycle, which requires more front-end data. Simple linear programming is generally 1: 10 and complex linear programming is generally 1: 3~1: 5. In order to further verify the difference between the two algorithms, the amount of predata required by the two algorithms to predict 3 cycles of data on the premise of sensitivity > 85% and the maximum amount of data cycles"

In order to further verify the difference between the two algorithms, the amount of predata required by the two algorithms to predict 3 cycles of data on the premise of sensitivity > 85% and the maximum amount of data cycles that can be predicted on the premise of 50 lines of predata are analyzed. The statistical results are shown in Table2.Table  2.Comparison of simulation results of data demand and data premeasurement (sensitivity > 85%).Algorithm typeForecast 3-cycle data demand50 predictable period of raw dataMachine learning5.827.3State space33.64.8In Table2, the data support required by the machine learning algorithm under the same prediction cycle demand is far less than that of the traditional state space algorithm, and the number of prediction cycles can be given far more than that of the state space algorithm under the same original data support conditions. The efficiency of machine learning algorithm is 5.79 times and 5.69 times higher than that of state space algorithm. No matter what application scenario, machine learning algorithm has the advantage of small demand for original data, and machine learning algorithm can realize high sensitivity data prediction with the support of incomplete data.8.

"data.8. SummaryThe data statistics cycle of the government system is long, generally taking January (30 days) as the statistical cycle, so the amount of data is small. When using the linear programming algorithm, it is easy to lead to low sensitivity of data prediction and data early warning due to the lack of front data support. Therefore, in the linear programming, the machine learning algorithm is used to replace the traditional state space algorithm. It can effectively improve the early warning ability of the system supported by incomplete data. The economic basic model of the algorithm research in this paper is the inward logistics economic park, that is, to build large processing enterprises with high demand for bulk materials in the logistics park and introduce financial institutions to provide financial support. The follow-up study will have a more in-depth discussion on the regional economic organization model.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to report regarding the present study.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe experimental data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Risna Y.,Budi W.,Rismutia H.

"AbstractIn order to discuss the construction and application of the SPD automated management module for interventional high-value consumables based on RFID sensors, a high-value medical consumables management information system based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is designed and implemented in this paper. It not only realizes the scientific, effective, and full-process monitoring of high-value medical consumables management but also provides managers with scientific and efficient management methods, combined with HIS and SPD's \"Unified Receiving Platform\" system and barcode technology, to achieve drug barcode acceptance. The experimental results show that the goal of zero inventory management of high value medical consumables is realized and the whole tracking management of use, warehousing, billing, and payment, the high value consumables can be traced back to suppliers and manufacturers and patients, and the inventory, accounting, and payment status can be checked at any time. It proves the effectiveness of RFID technology in the construction and application of SPD automatic management module for high-value consumables.1. IntroductionWith the rapid development of science and technology and hospital business, new materials and new technologies continue to emerge.

"new materials and new technologies continue to emerge. The government-led and provincial-level online centralized procurement of high-value medical consumables continues to advance, and high-value medical consumables are more and more widely used, which effectively improves the medical level of the hospital [1]. As shown in Figure1, due to the high price and variety of high-value medical consumables, it is particularly important to carry out strict, scientific, efficient, and traceable management on the procurement, storage, distribution, use registration, and waste disposal of high-value medical consumables. In particular, when some high-value medical consumables are implanted into the human body for a long time, product quality problems and medical device adverse events have become the main contradiction between doctors and patients [2]. The fine management system of the whole process of medical high-value consumables is aimed at realizing the fine information visual management of the whole process of medical high-value consumables and implementing real-time two-way traceability closed-loop management of consumables to ensure the safety and quality of consumables. The system realizes the information fine management of the whole process of medical high-value consumables application, approval, procurement, acceptance, warehousing, inventory management, and warehousing use.

Literature ReviewEstler et al. used radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in logistics distribution and warehousing, mainly to identify and locate products, cargo spaces, boxes, pallets, workers, and other objects, and attached RFID electronic tags to the corresponding target objects to realize real-time tracking of the location of finished products in the warehouse and real-time understanding of the quantity, location, and entry and exit conditions of finished products in the warehouse [3]. RFID technology can improve the supply chain and achieve efficient management by reducing inventory losses. Justinvil et al. proposed the optimization management of RFID-based three-dimensional storage, picking, and distribution in the clothing supply chain.

"of RFID electronic tag, the three-dimensional storage center under the application of RFID, and the optimal management of outbound distribution picking path was put forward, so as to improve the efficiency and accuracy of warehousing picking and distribution [4]. Kul'ga combined with SAINT ANGELO to develop a production and logistics management system based on RFID technology and a distribution management system. Through the production management system, it monitors the production progress in real time. It also has production data processing technology, which can effectively process a large amount of data transmitted by RFID system. The use of RFID technology in the warehousing and distribution process can effectively improve the management efficiency of warehousing and distribution. The path of using RFID technology in warehousing is shown in Figure2[5].Open in figure viewerPowerPointXin et al. used RFID to carry out inventory. In the past, it usually took 1 h to complete the inventory of the goods in the store. Now it only takes 10 minutes to complete the reading of RFID electronic tags of all goods, which greatly improves the efficiency of inventory.

"and the company can quickly complete replenishment and delivery through the data. The tracking management of the production line mainly uses RFID technology to track the position of the product in real time, speed up the sewing workflow, and avoid the occurrence of out of stock. It is mainly through the reader to read the RFID electronic tag attached to the product to track the location. The tag is the only identification during the entire production process, which are used to quickly locate and process the work-in-progress [6]. Zhang and others proposed an RFID-based suit production order tracking management system for the problems of isolated and disordered data collected on the garment production site, low real-time performance, and difficulty in tracking production orders. Combined with the actual production of enterprises, it shows that the management ability in the production process is improved and the tracking of production orders is realized. According to the actual situation of a company, Gao combined the concept of lean production and RFID technology to strengthen the intensity of production management, while optimizing the layout of clothing production equipment and balancing the production line [7].

"et al. proposed the use of RFID technology in the production process of denim and the use of RFID electronic tags for positioning in the production process of denim. Through data analysis on the assembly line, they proposed an improvement method for the production process of denim [8]. Schulze et al. proposed a real-time production tracking system based on RFID, which fully embodies the concept of lean production [9]. Decker et al. believe that hospitals must choose a more cost-effective drug management and storage mode, prepare drugs scientifically and reasonably, and improve drug management efficiency, so as to not only greatly reduce drug storage costs but also ensure the clinical use of drugs in our hospital, so as to effectively solve the problem of inventory management [10]. Romero and Rozano believed at the beginning of the project, it takes some time for the staff of the drug store to familiarize themselves with the scanning gun, the related application systems in the tablet computer, and their operation methods. And during the acceptance process, sometimes the network speed is slow or the scanning gun malfunctions, so it is necessary to use traditional acceptance methods to accept drugs, which affects the acceptance rate [11]. Hilburn believed after more than one year of operation with the decline of the system failure rate and the more skilled operation of the drug warehouse staff, the work efficiency has increased significantly [12].On the basis of current"
"rate [11]. Hilburn believed after more than one year of operation with the decline of the system failure rate and the more skilled operation of the drug warehouse staff, the work efficiency has increased significantly [12].On the basis of current research, this paper designs and implements a high-value medical consumables management information system based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which not only realizes the scientific, effective, and whole-process monitoring and management of high-value medical consumables but also provides managers with scientific and efficient management means and HIS. With SPD's \"Unified Receipt Platform\" system and bar code technology, drug bar code acceptance is realized.3. Cooperative Application of SPD and RFIDThe definition of SPD in supply chain management is Supply-Processing-Distribution. The SPD model manages medical consumables as a whole by linking core members of the internal and external supply chains of medical consumables to improve management efficiency. The SPD model comprehensively considers the operation rules, characteristics, and interlinkages of each management link of medical consumables in the hospital. Under the support of supply chain management theory and information technology, the traditional management method of medical consumables is optimized and improved. Consumables management mode is suitable for current social and medical background. RFID is an acronym for radio frequency identification."
"and information technology, the traditional management method of medical consumables is optimized and improved. Consumables management mode is suitable for current social and medical background. RFID is an acronym for radio frequency identification. The principle is the noncontact data communication between the reader and the tag to achieve the purpose of identifying the target. The application of RFID is very wide; typical applications are animal chip, car chip immobilizer, access control, parking lot control, production line automation, and material management.3.1. The Basic Working Principle of RFIDInstall the RFID tag on the identified object (sticking, inserting, wearing, implanting, etc.); when the identified object enters the magnetic field, a wireless communication link is established between the tag and the reader. The tag sends the product information stored in the chip to the reader. The reader receives and decodes the information and transmits it to the information system for data processing. At present, there is no global organization to uniformly manage the standards used in RFID. The two popular tags in China are ISO14443 close-coupled IC card and ISO15693 loose-coupled IC card. The system developed in this paper will use ISO15693 loose-coupled IC card. The advantage of this type of card is that it has a large amount of stored data and can better support simultaneous reading of multiple cards, which is in line with the use of high-value medical consumables"
"paper will use ISO15693 loose-coupled IC card. The advantage of this type of card is that it has a large amount of stored data and can better support simultaneous reading of multiple cards, which is in line with the use of high-value medical consumables [13].3.2. SPD ApplicationThe first is to establish a \"Unified Receiving Platform\" system, which applies barcode technology to achieve drug barcode inspection and acceptance. Then, by setting up a drug fixed quantity package in the \"Unified Receiving Platform\" system and scanning the fixed quantity card on the outer packaging of the drug, the automatic entry and exit of drugs the automatic generation of purchase plan can be realized. Finally, the purchase plan is optimized with the help of the fixed quantity package function to realize the scientific management of the drug library inventory [14].3.2.1. Establish a \"Unified Receiving Platform\" SystemThe \"Unified Receiving Platform\" system is a set of \"smart chain\" platform independently developed by Sinopharm Holding Co., Ltd., which can realize the functions of drug barcode receipt, electronic drug sales invoice, mobile Internet application, and anywhere acceptance.3.2.2. Changes in the Inspection and Acceptance of Medicines in the PharmacyAfter the pharmacy staff of this hospital sends the drug order to the third-party drug procurement platform in Guangdong Province based on the drug inventory, the drug distribution company (a delivery company with barcode technology) will"
"in the PharmacyAfter the pharmacy staff of this hospital sends the drug order to the third-party drug procurement platform in Guangdong Province based on the drug inventory, the drug distribution company (a delivery company with barcode technology) will log in to the procurement platform to obtain the drug order and print the drug sales order (invoice). After the stock is prepared, the drug order data is synchronously transmitted to the \"Unified Receiving Platform\" system, and then, the drugs are distributed to the hospital pharmacy, and the pharmacy accepts the drugs.3.3. Implementation of Server LayerIf you need to add other types of readers or return other types of tags, you need to design corresponding processing methods based on the previous design framework. In the specific implementation process, it is mainly necessary to design the classes required by the following types of sensors to implement the corresponding operations [15].(1)Sensor session class: the sensor session class generates a connection to the sensor and collects data from this connection. A sensor session corresponds to a sensor object. Once the sensor session is created, it cannot be changed. The sensor session is the most important part, which is mainly composed of three parts:(i)Connection logic: the sensor session contains the logic required to connect to the sensor and maintain this connection. When a sensor disconnects and tries to connect again, the sensor session can be detected"
"which is mainly composed of three parts:(i)Connection logic: the sensor session contains the logic required to connect to the sensor and maintain this connection. When a sensor disconnects and tries to connect again, the sensor session can be detected [16](ii)Execution of orders: the sensor session needs to ensure that the commands assigned to the sensor can be executed in a thread-safe manner(iii)Agreement analysis: the sensor session needs to analyze the acquired information according to the protocol used by the sensor. Therefore, some common problems in sensor session can be dealt with according to some extensible classes provided by API, such as TCP/IP, a typical protocol usually used to connect readers. API provides an abstract class to handle the TCP/IP protocol soundlyIn our design, there are two kinds of commands used to interact with the sensor: single-shot command is used to execute only-once and repeated command is used to execute repeatedly according to regulations. Each command will use the following three classes:(1)Command class: the command class is an executable class, executed by a session. This command requires fast execution, which means that sleep and long running cycles need to be avoided [17](2)Command configuration class: the command configuration class is used to generate commands. It has various attributes needed to generate commands and has an ID for OSGi command line identification(3)Command configuration factory class: the command configuration"
"configuration class: the command configuration class is used to generate commands. It has various attributes needed to generate commands and has an ID for OSGi command line identification(3)Command configuration factory class: the command configuration factory class is a factory that generates command configuration.

The card reader provides timing and energy to the electronic tag through the coupling module and performs half-duplex information interaction between the send and receive and control module and the electronic tag.

Database SystemThe database system is mainly composed of database and management software, which can realize the functions of storage, maintenance, query, and statistics of intelligent building asset data and manage user information, parameter information, maintenance records, and other information [20].4.2. Asset Management SystemWhen there are two or more electronic tags within the range of the card reader sending information at the same time, the card reader may have a data conflict (that is, data collision), which will lead to a short-term failure of the receiving module of the card reader; the data cannot be received in a timely and accurate manner, which will reduce the performance and efficiency of the system. In order to solve this problem and ensure that each tag can be read correctly, a tag anticollision algorithm is needed [21].Assuming thatNRFID tags are in a specific area, the frame size isL.Pc,Ps, andPi, respectively, represent possible collision, success, and idleness, and then, calculatePcaccording"

The asset inventory query management system can also export Excel tables or XML reports [22]. The system can provide a variety of data query methods, such as single condition query and multiple conditions combination queries, and the query results can be browsed in the form of a list.

ConclusionIn the early stage of the project, it takes a period of time for the staff of the drugstore to familiarize themselves with the scanning gun and the related application systems in the tablet computer and their operation methods. In the acceptance process, sometimes the network speed is slow or the scanning gun malfunctions, so the traditional acceptance method needs to be used to accept drugs, which will affect the acceptance rate. Therefore, in the early stage of the project, it has little improvement in work efficiency and faces many difficulties. The compliance of drug warehouse staff in using scanning gun to accept drugs is poor.

"AbstractThe establishment of the agricultural and forestry land management information system is predicated on the acquisition of spatial positioning data of agricultural and forestry land, i.e., the surveying and mapping of agricultural and forestry land. It also serves as the central component of the overall management information system. It is necessary to find solutions to the issues of large plot areas and far-reaching boundary lines in light of the current situation of land right confirmation. With its high efficiency, the use of GPS technology for land right confirmation can not only increase work productivity and speed up construction but also lower operating costs. The method of confirming landownership through surveying and mapping is studied in this paper using GPS technology. With respect to various land types, various classification methods have varying degrees of classification accuracy. This method is one of the three algorithms that classify green land, which includes grassland, cultivated land, and forest land; however, it does not clearly distinguish between forest land and grassland, with forest land having an average classification accuracy of 58.69 percent. The average accuracy of classifying forest land is 73.14 percent. The classification accuracy of forest land using this method is 88.45 percent, which is a relatively high percentage.

"land is 73.14 percent. The classification accuracy of forest land using this method is 88.45 percent, which is a relatively high percentage. It can be seen that this method is more accurate in identifying minute differences between ground objects. This is demonstrated by comparing the accuracy of forest land classification with that of other methods. A lot of surveying and mapping work has been done on the assumption that urban control networks have been established in many cities. The most ideal option is to combine GPS technology with high-precision photogrammetry.1. IntroductionThe confirmation of land right is the identification of the location, boundary address, ownership nature, right subject, and identity of the land. The measurement of landownership confirmation is the basic work for the standardization of landownership confirmation registration, the registration of landownership according to law, and the settlement of landownership disputes. It is one of the important foundations for the fine production of land in the current society. The cadastral control survey is based on the accuracy requirements of boundary points and cadastral map, and the number and level of existing control points in the visual survey space area and test area [1]. It is necessary to carry out relevant design planning in accordance with the basic measurement criteria and accuracy requirements, so as to better handle relevant measurement work.

It is necessary to carry out relevant design planning in accordance with the basic measurement criteria and accuracy requirements, so as to better handle relevant measurement work. The acquisition of spatial positioning data of agricultural and forestry land, that is, the surveying and mapping of agricultural and forestry land, is the premise for the establishment of agricultural and forestry land management information system, and also the core of the whole management information system [2,3]. The land surveying and mapping technology has experienced from the steel ruler combined with the scale measurement method, which is difficult to deal with arcs and broken lines, to the theodolite combined with steel ruler measurement method to solve irregular land, and then to the total station measurement method, which is convenient for application and does not need to be erected on the land. In the survey of landownership confirmation and registration, we are faced with the problems of a large parcel of land and long distance between boundary lines. If the total station is used to collect cadastral elements, the layout of its control network is highly required and difficult to achieve [4]. The main purpose of surveying and mapping for the confirmation and certification of rural contracted land is to effectively solve the problems of area calculation and graphic analysis in the process of certification.

"surveying and mapping for the confirmation and certification of rural contracted land is to effectively solve the problems of area calculation and graphic analysis in the process of certification. It is a basic work to establish the information system in the surveying and mapping method for the confirmation and certification of rural contracted land. However, at present, in China, generally speaking, agricultural and forestry land surveying and mapping and information acquisition are still at a relatively backward stage, and most areas are still at the original measurement level of tape measurement, manual calculation, and manual recording [5,6]. The reason is that on the one hand, some measurement methods are not applicable to the measurement of agricultural and forestry land and that on the other hand, the new technology measurement equipment has the limitations of complex operation [7], difficult to use, and requiring professional operation. Therefore, in the surveying and mapping of agricultural and forestry land, there is an urgent need for the development and popularization of high-precision and easy-to-operate surveying and mapping equipment.The purpose of land right confirmation is to ascertain the location, boundary, ownership type, and right subject of land resources. It is a crucial foundation for the development and management of land resources. The issues of a large plot area and a great distance between boundary lines must be resolved in light of the current"
"ownership type, and right subject of land resources. It is a crucial foundation for the development and management of land resources. The issues of a large plot area and a great distance between boundary lines must be resolved in light of the current situation regarding the confirmation of land rights, and various new technologies must be actively applied on the foundation of already existing technologies. Among them, the use of GPS technology for land right confirmation has a high efficiency, and it can be used to improve work efficiency, speed up construction, and lower operating costs [8]. The term \"GPS technology\" refers to both real-time differential GPS technology and real-time dynamic measurement technology based on carrier phase observation. GPS technology, which primarily consists of a mobile station, reference station receiver, and data link, represents a significant advancement in the field of surveying. Real-time dynamic differential positioning (RTDDP) technology such as GPS is primarily based on reference station and mobile station high-precision carrier phase observations [9,10]. The reference station typically needs to have a GPS receiver that can continuously track visible satellites and use radio transmission equipment to send observation data in real time to the user observation station. In addition to receiving the satellite signal, the GPS receiver in the mobile station also receives data sent from the reference station through wireless receiving"
"equipment to send observation data in real time to the user observation station. In addition to receiving the satellite signal, the GPS receiver in the mobile station also receives data sent from the reference station through wireless receiving equipment [11]. The three-dimensional coordinates of the mobile station are then acquired and precisely positioned in accordance with the relative positioning.With the continuous progress and development of social economy, the control area of the existing control network has been completely unable to meet the needs of all aspects at present. Some control points have suffered great damage, so at this time, we will continue to use positioning technology to strengthen and improve the existing control network as the first-level control network of the cadastral survey [12]. In the process of using GPS technology to measure the urban cadastral control network, it should be combined with the original control points. The GPS survey technology constructs a reasonable survey team according to the size of the operation area before the survey. Each team member will work together to ensure the completion of the measurement. The general situation measurement team consists of instrument operator, recorder, and navigator, which can be adjusted according to the actual situation. It is necessary to carry out relevant design planning according to the basic measurement criteria and accuracy requirements, so as to better handle the related measurement"
"recorder, and navigator, which can be adjusted according to the actual situation. It is necessary to carry out relevant design planning according to the basic measurement criteria and accuracy requirements, so as to better handle the related measurement work using GPS technology to measure the urban cadastral basic control network. According to other methods of surveying boundary coordinates, mapping cadastral maps by aerial survey is the most important way of urban foundation survey in China at present. In many cities, urban control networks have usually been established, and a lot of surveying and mapping work has been done under this premise. It is the best choice to use high-precision photogrammetry technology under GPS technology.The main innovations I put forward in this paper are as follows:(1)This paper constructs the composition model of GPS satellite signal. In order to ensure the accuracy of the survey results, the application of GPS technology in landownership survey must choose an area with an open field of vision and no cover in the air, which is convenient for the mobile station and the reference station to transmit the survey information through the GPS satellite signal composition model.

"surveying technologies, GPS technology has greatly reduced the number of staff in practical application, and one person can complete the collection of land surveying information, which provides a basis for the development and management of land resources and promotes the expansion of the project schedule.(2)The advantages of GPS measurement are discussed. Land use survey is the main means to understand the characteristics and laws of land resources and to master the quantity, quality, and distribution pattern of land resources, and is the basic work to carry out land resources research. GPS is used to measure three-dimensional coordinate data. In practical application, two-dimensional images are generally used to display the geographic information of farmland. Because the requirement of measurement accuracy is far lower than that of professional surveying and mapping, and only the local area is measured, the simplified method is adopted for data calculation.2. Related WorkThe physical foundation of human production, daily life, and social progress is land. In order to support the reform of rural collective land, safeguard farmers' land rights and interests, and reduce the tension between rural people and their land, it is crucial to confirm the right to rural collective land, as well as to ascertain the status of that land's use and the division of ownership. The cadastral management system in China today is fundamentally different from the one in place prior to liberation."
"to confirm the right to rural collective land, as well as to ascertain the status of that land's use and the division of ownership. The cadastral management system in China today is fundamentally different from the one in place prior to liberation. Land is owned by the working class throughout China's socialist nation. Establishing a cadastral management system will improve China's land resources planning and the protection of working people's property.Zhao makes clear the land parcel, area, and location by carrying out right confirmation registration, which is conducive not only to the protection of cultivated land, but also to the formulation and implementation of a series of policies to strengthen agriculture and benefit agriculture. It is also helpful for the state to formulate modern agricultural development plans, issue policies and measures to promote land transfer, and guide the standardized transfer of land based on the registered data [13]. Sediyono and Windarni put forward the work of confirmation, registration, and certification of rural land contractual management right, which is based on the existing rural land contractual management account, contract, and certificate, to find out the area and spatial location of the contracted land, establish and improve the land contractual management right register, and properly solve the problems of inaccurate contracted land area, unclear four directions, unknown spatial location, imperfect register, etc. [14].

"of the contracted land, establish and improve the land contractual management right register, and properly solve the problems of inaccurate contracted land area, unclear four directions, unknown spatial location, imperfect register, etc. [14]. In his research paper, Wang briefly described several land survey methods in different periods and different technical means, and gave a bird's-eye view of the changes and development of some land survey methods in recent years: from the measurement method of steel ruler combined with scale, to the measurement method of warp gauge combined with steel ruler, to the total station measurement method, and finally mentioned the measurement method of total station combined with the digital soil measurement system [15]. Feng proposed that in the land right confirmation work, satellite images were generally used before. With the development of UAV technology, the images taken by UAVs have the advantages of high resolution, good image quality, stable received signals, and so on. They are relatively good data sources [16]. Hauser et al. proposed the role of stabilizing the rural land contract relationship. The two-tier management system based on household contract management and the combination of unification and decentralization is the basis of the party's rural policy.

"of unification and decentralization is the basis of the party's rural policy. A solid land contracting relationship and a better understanding of the plots, areas, and spatial locations contracted by the common people will help consolidate the party's rural land contracting and management system [17]. Zheng and Di Rong proposed that when reviewing the development of surveying and mapping instruments in history and looking forward to the development trend of surveying and mapping instruments, they introduced in detail the real estate boundary survey in ancient Egypt, the magnetic compass in ancient China, and the ancient surveying and mapping method and instruments of \"left line, right rule\" in Dayu's flood control [18]. Wang et al. put forward that due to local protectionism, backward economy and technology, and other reasons, there are false and concealed rural collective land use data in some places, which makes it difficult for the state to master accurate rural collective land use data. This phenomenon seriously affects land management, interferes with the state's scientific planning and decision-making on rural collective land, and lays hidden dangers for rural economic development and social harmony [19].

"to directly calculate the three-dimensional coordinates of boundary points by automatically recording the height angle, horizontal angle, and oblique distance of each detail point on the field electronic notebook or handheld computer, then using the photographic mapping technology. Photogrammetry, also known as aerial photogrammetry, is to obtain the specific orientation of the target by following aerial photographs and measuring negatives [20]. Wang proposed that high-quality rural collective land use data are the basis for promoting national development and social progress, and the basis for ensuring the sustainable and healthy development of the national economy [21]. Octavia A proposed that the period of updating and changing the utilization of rural collective land is becoming shorter and shorter. In order to master the utilization status of rural collective land, strictly enforce the land use management system, and promote the reform of rural collective land, the state has made a major decision to carry out the confirmation of the rights of rural collective land [22].Based on GPS technology, this paper studies the surveying and mapping method of landownership. From the perspective of rural collective landownership production units, it studies how to control the process of rural collective landownership data and check the spatial data results before warehousing, so as to improve the quality of rural collective landownership spatial data, and reduce the data errors and"

According to the requirements of rapid land area measurement and information management, GPS technology develops portable area measuring instruments and land management information system, and provides a scientific basis for agricultural production and planning management. This paper analyzes the main aspects of data inspection under GPS technology, and puts forward the basic ideas of automatic inspection for polygon overlap inspection, gap inspection, and duplicate line inspection, as well as line discount and boundary line less vertex inspection.3. Method3.1. Principle and Model of GPS TechnologyA satellite navigation system with a medium-distance circular orbit is the global positioning system (GPS). For locations on the surface of the earth, the global positioning system (GPS) offers precise positioning, velocity measurement, and high-precision time standards. It is necessary to choose a location with an open field of vision and no cover in the air for the application of GPS technology in the land right confirmation survey in order to ensure the accuracy of survey results [23].

"the application of GPS technology in the land right confirmation survey in order to ensure the accuracy of survey results [23]. This will make it easier to transmit survey information between mobile stations and reference stations via the model made up of GPS satellite signals. GPS technology has significantly reduced the amount of staff needed in actual applications when compared to other survey technologies. Additionally, one person can finish the collection of land survey data, serve as the foundation for the development and management of land resources, and support the expansion of project progress. The carrier, ranging code, and data codes that make up the satellite signal are all produced using the same reference frequency, as are the other signal components. Figure1depicts the GPS satellite signal's composition model.Open in figure viewerPowerPointThe GPS workflow consists of four steps:(1)Selection and inspection of instruments when selecting receiving equipment; it is best to use dual-frequency or multifrequency receivers, and ensure the stability of the equipment. When selecting the base station receiving equipment, the equipment with the function of transmitting standard differential data shall be selected.(2)Selection of reference station in the process of GPS-RTK measurement; the accuracy of measurement directly depends on the quality of data transmission.

Therefore, it is very important to select the location of the reference station. A good reference station can ensure the transmission quality of the data link [24].(3)Setting of reference station after the site of the reference station is selected; the receiver antenna shall be installed first. It can be installed at either a known point or an unknown point. The setting process of the reference station is basically similar to that of the static surveying and mapping, including centering, leveling, and measuring antenna height.(4)GPS survey in the land right confirmation survey; RTK survey is divided into three steps: the first step is to start the reference station. When the reference station is erected at a known point, the current WGS-84 coordinates are entered to start the reference station. If an unknown point is erected, the WGS-84 coordinates measured by single-point positioning shall be sent to the GPS host for startup.GPS can realize a unique spatial information system. In terms of implementation and modeling, it has shown its unique characteristics and advantages. First, a receiver is set on the reference station, which is used as the reference station to observe the satellite, and the observed data and station information are transmitted to the mobile station.GPS can uniformly geocode the vector data of the parcel"

The schematic diagram of the GPS satellite positioning principle is shown in Figure2.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAfter the GPS radio signal is received by the user receiver, if the clock of the receiver is accurately synchronized with the satellite clock, the time from the GPS satellite to the GPS user receiver can be measured, and the time difference is the propagation time of the satellite signal in space.(1)wheret2is the time of reception andt1is the time of transmission.According to the distance formula between two points in European space, the distanceDbetween GPS user receiver and GPS satellite can be obtained as follows.(2)whereDrepresents the distance between GPS user receiver and GPS satellite, which is also called observation; (xi,yi,zi) represents the orbit coordinates of each satellite, and (x,y,z) represents the coordinates of GPS user receiver.Assuming that the difference between the instantaneous time when the GPS receiver receives the GPS satellite signal and the time of the GPS satellite positioning and navigation system is a fixed value Δt, the formula should be modified as"

"and the corresponding correction number of the baseline of the same name of the unconstrained adjustment result after gross errors are removed shall meet the requirements of the following formula:(10)GPS technology can quickly locate spatial data. RS technology can use aerial photographs, satellite photographs, and other image data provided by aerospace and aerial remote sensing to accurately locate and quantify land blocks, and visually interpret the characteristics of ground objects and the current situation of resources [26]. Since the application of GPS positioning technology in surveying engineering, it has the advantages of high automation, all-weather operation, and high precision. The specific performance is explained as follows.3.2.1. Flexible Point SelectionDifferent from traditional control survey, GPS positioning technology has low requirements for intervisibility between points. Unless there are special requirements, intervisibility is generally not required, and there are few flexible restrictions on point selection. It reduces the requirement of point network structure.3.2.2. Being Weather-IndependentGPS positioning can basically realize all-weather operation and normal operation under normal weather conditions.3.2.3.

"High Degree of Automation and Convenient OperationWhen the operator carries the instrument for operation, after placing the instrument and opening it, he only needs to measure the height of the instrument and monitor the working state of the instrument. The instrument can automatically receive the GPS satellite signal, thus reducing the difficulty of operation and effectively improving the work efficiency.3.2.4. High AccuracyWhen the distance is ≥1000 km, the relative positioning accuracy reaches 10-8; when the distance is 50∼500 km, the relative positioning accuracy reaches 10-6-10-7; and when the distance is ≤50 km, the relative positioning accuracy reaches 10-6. On the contrary, there is no need to build survey targets.Remote sensing and global positioning systems are primarily used in the application of GIS technology in land use planning and management to obtain spatial data. On this foundation, a land use dynamic remote sensing monitoring system and a land use change management information system are set up to support the creation and revision of planning, the creation of annual land use plans, the preliminary review of construction project land, the review of land use planning for approval, and the administration of land development and consolidation projects.

"of land development and consolidation projects. Inspection by law enforcement and monitoring of planning and implementation [27,28] is constrained by the following: first, satellite circumstances--the working time is limited by the satellite signal being blocked for an extended period of time in high mountains, dense forests, and urban high-rise areas. This problem can be solved by choosing the working time; and second, the data link transmission, which is impeded and limited, and the operation radius, which is shorter than the nominal distance.4. Realization of Surveying and Mapping Method of Landownership4.1. Application and Analysis of GPS Survey Technology in Land Right Confirmation SurveyFor the application of GPS technology in land right confirmation survey, in order to ensure the accuracy of survey results, it is necessary to select an area with an open field of vision and no cover in the air, so as to facilitate the transmission of survey information between mobile stations and reference stations through GPS satellites. The preparation of measurement related data, including data creation, import, and export. The different requirements of the operation require us to make targeted formulation and reasonable selection.

"Only the early work is well selected, good data analysis is carried out, and input is made, which plays a good guarantee for the later work. In the process of rural land cadastral survey, if we want to improve the accuracy of mapping, we often choose the fourth-class control point as the reference point to lead the control point to the required rural area. Since most of the observation data of real-time dynamic measurement are independent observation values, there is no way to calculate the test value with high accuracy through the data. Therefore, we will choose to use the form of repeated observation and total station traverse retest to ensure the accuracy of the final measurement result. GPS-RTK technology is applicable to large survey radius. Plain areas can meet the survey requirements of 18 km, while the operation radius in areas with complex terrain can reach about 9 km, and the survey accuracy can meet the survey requirements of a land planning topographic map. It is necessary to try to stay away from places with strong interferences, such as radio signal transmission towers and high-voltage lines. Because the radio signal will strongly interfere with the GPS satellite signal, resulting in inaccurate data. The required instruments and equipment shall be selected according to the technical requirements and operating environment. Generally, dual-frequency receiver and multifrequency receiver shall be selected. Compared with other receiving equipment, they have higher"
"instruments and equipment shall be selected according to the technical requirements and operating environment. Generally, dual-frequency receiver and multifrequency receiver shall be selected. Compared with other receiving equipment, they have higher reliability and stability to ensure that the measurement results are highly representative. After the benchmark station and mobile station are installed, professionals can be organized to conduct field survey.During the measurement process, the number of operation teams must be selected according to the size of the actual measurement area, and the operators are required to operate in strict accordance with the measurement specifications. The stability of the basic structure of the reference station shall be ensured as far as possible, which can operate stably for a long time and facilitate the implementation of various testing operations. Besides, it shall be convenient to install various instruments and equipment around the station site, and the field of vision shall be expanded with good information transmission conditions. In the land right confirmation work, satellite images were generally used before. With the development of UAV technology, the images taken by UAV have the advantages of high resolution, good image quality, stable received signal, and so on. They are relatively good data sources.

"advantages of high resolution, good image quality, stable received signal, and so on. They are relatively good data sources. If you choose to use a split receiver, you need to focus on the host antenna connection, host radio connection, and the connection between the radio and the data link transmitting antenna. The use of spatial database is to associate complex parcel spatial data with attribute data, and establish a flexible geospatial database. It is spatial data engine rather than spatial database that operates spatial data. It mainly acts as a bridge between relational database and program. The spatial database engine can not only transfer the spatial data to the database for storage, but also obtain the spatial database. GPS survey technology and total station survey are selected to carry out relevant cadastral survey and carry out detailed field survey for all villages. GPS is generally used in the encrypted survey of the mapping control points, and the total station carries out a detailed survey. The reasonable use of GPS and total station promotes the successful completion of the cadastral survey in a short time, and also improves the accuracy of survey. Therefore, we need to encode the data of spatial database and use a unified format to build a complete database. Whether in plane or vertical aspects, attribute data and spatial attribute data need to be nested.

"use a unified format to build a complete database. Whether in plane or vertical aspects, attribute data and spatial attribute data need to be nested. The reason why we use spatial database is to enable the landownership confirmation system to efficiently query spatial data, display maps, and operate layers and other functions. It is of great significance to improve the efficiency of land resources development and management. In order to give full play to its advantages, it is necessary to take measures to control each link based on the technical principles and the key points of technical application, so as to reduce the interference of various factors and improve the accuracy of measurement data.4.2. Experimental Results and AnalysisThere are three types of research regional data: statistical data, remote sensing data, and spatial data. Statistical data mainly include the resident population and self-employed export volume of towns and streets in 2021, which comes from the Xiaoshan District Statistical Yearbook. For the goal of minimum planning cost, because the conversion cost between different land use types is difficult to obtain directly, reference [6] proposes to indirectly reflect the conversion cost using the conversion coefficient of land use types.

According to the above training and testing methods, the prediction results of the prediction model under the conditions of the first set of data sets can be obtained, as shown in Figure3.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs can be seen from Figure3, under the condition that the development trend of training data is stable, the predicted value of this method is roughly consistent with the true value curve, and the normalized numerical error is basically within the range of 0.2, so the prediction effect is ideal.Then, under the condition of the second data set, the prediction results of the prediction model of this method are shown in Figure4.Open in figure viewerPowerPointAs shown in Figure4, when the training set data fluctuate, the prediction error of the prediction model of this method increases slightly, but the overall accuracy of the result remains at a high level, and the normalized error can basically be controlled within 0.3.Under different multiobjective systems, the results of land use optimization are compared with the land use structure before optimization, as shown in Table3.3.Comparison of land use structure after optimization of different multiobjective systems.Cultivated land, %Woodland, %Grassland, %Construction land, %Unused land, %202040.3516.110.0342.420.52M1After"

In addition, the proportion of unused land is also reduced, and the land utilization rate is improved. Compared withM1, the proportion of cultivated land inM2 is smaller, while the proportion of forest land and construction land increases. The proportion ofM3 forest land has decreased. Therefore, it is considered that in the expansion target, the ecological service value plays a major role, while the carbon emission plays a secondary role. From the difference ofM3, it can be seen that the carbon emission target has a certain inhibitory effect on the ecological service value target.In this experiment, reference [7], reference [12], and this method are used to test the classification accuracy of grassland, cultivated land, and forest land.

The experimental results are shown in Figures5-7.Open in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointOpen in figure viewerPowerPointFrom Figures5-7, it can be seen that different classification methods have different classification accuracy for different land types. Among the three algorithms, the method in document [7] does not clearly distinguish between forest land and grassland in the classification of green land, i.e., grassland, cultivated land, and forest land. The average accuracy of forest land classification is 58.69%, grassland classification is 55.12%, and cultivated land classification is 70.23%. The method in reference [12] does not clearly distinguish between forest land and grassland. The average accuracy of forest land classification is 73.14%, grassland classification is 65.54%, and cultivated land classification is 78.43%.

"land. Through the comparison of classification accuracy of grassland, cultivated land, and forest land, it can be seen that literature [7] and literature [12] are not as effective as this method in distinguishing small differences between ground objects, because these three ground types are particularly similar in spectral characteristics.5. ConclusionsWith regard to measuring landownership, GPS technology measurement offers a number of benefits over more conventional measurement techniques, including quick observation times, all-weather operation, and ease of use. Additionally, GPS technology has a measurement range that is essentially greater than 10 km, which significantly increases measurement accuracy. The surveying and mapping techniques used to determine landownership are examined in this paper using GPS technology. With respect to various land types, various classification methods have varying degrees of classification accuracy. The average classification accuracy for woodland is 58.69 percent among the three algorithms, and the method in reference [7] does not make it clear enough to differentiate it from grassland. The average accuracy of woodland classification in reference [12] is 73.14 percent, but it is not clear how to tell woodland from grassland. Although the methods used in this paper have a relatively high classification accuracy, woodland has the highest classification accuracy at 88.45%.

"how to tell woodland from grassland. Although the methods used in this paper have a relatively high classification accuracy, woodland has the highest classification accuracy at 88.45%. It can be seen that literature [7] and literature [12] are not as accurate as the method in this paper in identifying minute differences between ground objects. This is because the classification accuracy of forest land is not as high. The advancement and use of GPS technology has significantly raised the working standard for rural collective land certification and registration. This improvement is primarily seen in the measurement's accuracy and convenience. The GPS technology survey also has low requirements for the field of vision, which somewhat lowers the requirements of the working environment. The data's high accuracy also fully satisfies the criteria for the accuracy of landownership surveys.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares no conflicts of interest.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the author upon request.References1moon F.,China's land collective ownership of realistic thinking prospects,Campus English.

"AbstractThree-dimensional Geographic Information System (3D GIS) technology is often used in geology, mining, hydrology and other fields. It is also used in intelligent management of urban comprehensive pipe gallery projects, because the real environment with the sky, ground, and underground can be intuitively simulated in the virtual reality environment by 3D GIS platform. Through the research on data integration and application technology of urban comprehensive pipe gallery, the 3D model of comprehensive pipe gallery project data can be created based on Building Information Modelling and GIS technologies, and a comprehensive underground pipelines network management information system has been developed to realise the integration of various data, including 3D data of comprehensive pipe gallery model and underground pipe network model, 2D or 3D GIS data of the ground and underground etc. On this basis, the functions of intelligent planning and approval management, the safety analysis and disaster prevention planning and decision-making of urban comprehensive pipe gallery projects can be further realised. The research results have been applied to the planning and construction process management of the comprehensive pipe gallery project in the sub-centre of Beijing.1 INTRODUCTIONThe urban underground pipelines network is an important part of urban infrastructure.

"project in the sub-centre of Beijing.1 INTRODUCTIONThe urban underground pipelines network is an important part of urban infrastructure. There are more than 30 kinds of urban underground pipelines, include water supply pipelines, drainage pipelines, gas pipelines, heat pipelines, power pipelines, communication pipelines, industrial pipelines, and comprehensive pipe gallery [1-4]. These underground pipelines are important blocks for energy transmission, material transmission, information transmission, draining off water etc., which are necessary for the normal operation and development of cities. Urban underground pipelines network is usually characterised by large scale, wide range, complex spatial distribution, rapid growth speed, and long-term formation. It is increasingly showing three-dimensional features of complex and overlapping. Because a large number of underground pipelines are directly buried under the ground, it is difficult to change and to comprehensively monitor the operation potential of the urban underground pipelines network after completion. With the ageing of existing pipelines and the continuous increase of capacity carried, the frequency of urban underground pipelines accidents has increased significantly, which directly threatens to the safety of city and the stability of society. Now in some new urban areas in China, more comprehensive pipe galleries are built to realise centralised and convenient management of various underground pipelines. One"

Now in some new urban areas in China, more comprehensive pipe galleries are built to realise centralised and convenient management of various underground pipelines. One important goal for the comprehensive management and control of urban underground pipelines network is to realise the scientific planning, meticulous management, and comprehensive information sharing of urban underground pipelines network [1-15].The research on data integration and application technology of urban comprehensive pipe gallery based on 3D GIS platform mainly solves the optimisation of importing the comprehensive pipe gallery construction project data with Building Information Model (BIM) format into the comprehensive underground pipelines network management information system, and the integration of multiple types, 2D or 3D spatial data of urban ground and underground in the system. And some functions such as the intelligent planning and approval management of the comprehensive pipe gallery construction project, the safety analysis of the underground pipelines network and the disaster prevention planning and decision-making, are developed in the system software.2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGYThe research on data integration and application technology of urban comprehensive pipe gallery based on 3D GIS platform includes the following two parts.2.1 Research on key technologies of realising 3D visualisation of comprehensive pipe"
"METHODOLOGYThe research on data integration and application technology of urban comprehensive pipe gallery based on 3D GIS platform includes the following two parts.2.1 Research on key technologies of realising 3D visualisation of comprehensive pipe gallery construction project data on 3D GIS platformAn comprehensive pipe gallery construction project generally goes through planning, design, construction, completion verification and other stages. The data of the project in these stages are generally in BIM file format, such as .rvt format, .ifc format etc. In order to serve the comprehensive pipe gallery construction project planning and management, the researchers have developed a software named 3D intelligent system for full-cycle management and approval analysis of urban comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects which is based on 3D GIS platform software. By using this software, the data of the project in these stages can be imported, the comprehensive pipe gallery and its internal pipelines of the construction project can be 3D modelled and visualised according to the planning and design scheme or the completion verification data. And several functions have been developed, such as real-time querying, displaying, updating, and analysis of the pipe gallery data within the whole life cycle of the comprehensive pipe gallery construction project.2.2 Research on key technologies of integration of multiple spatial data related to planning and management of comprehensive"

It should meet the planning approval management requirements of specific underground pipeline or pipe gallery construction projects at micro scale. And at the meso-scale or macro-scale, it should meet the planning approval management requirements of urban sub-areas or areas. In order to meet the needs of macro scale, it is necessary to integrate the basic geographic data of the whole city or a certain area, the survey data of underground pipe network, the planning data of pipe network, the engineering geological and hydrogeological data, and the monitoring data of land subsidence etc. For the needs of mesoscale, the underground pipeline (comprehensive pipe gallery) data and other relevant data of specific comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects or local areas need be integrated. For the needs of micro scale, the detailed information of a single comprehensive pipe gallery construction project, such as the size and appearance information, material composition and interface form of the underground pipeline or pipe gallery.3.4 Determination of system"

However, general 3D GIS platforms often cannot directly load BIM data in Revit format. At the same time, due to the large amount of BIM data, many details in the data are often not important in the planning approval stage of the project, so some details in the BIM data of the comprehensive pipe gallery need to be appropriately simplified and the BIM data of the comprehensive pipe gallery need to be lightweight. The lightweight processing results of the BIM data can improve the efficiency and performance of loading and querying the BIM data of the project in the system software, and better serve the full cycle management and decision-making analysis of intelligent planning of comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects.The creation process of 3D visualisation model of comprehensive pipe gallery consists of three steps:"
"and better serve the full cycle management and decision-making analysis of intelligent planning of comprehensive pipe gallery construction projects.The creation process of 3D visualisation model of comprehensive pipe gallery consists of three steps: unifying spatial coordinate reference system of model data, developing the data exchanging tool of the comprehensive pipe gallery information model, and lossless release of the comprehensive pipe gallery model data.4.3.1 Unified spatial coordinate reference of model dataUnified plane coordinate system and elevation system and unified unit of measurement have been adopted for the creation of 3D visualisation model of comprehensive pipe gallery. The project data (BIM model data) of the integrated pipe gallery submitted by the owner often adopts an independent coordinate system. In the process of integrating the BIM model data of the project with the 3D GIS scene of the urban, it is not only necessary to deal with the correct spatial topological relationship among a large number of sub-level components in the BIM model, but also to ensure the correct relative spatial relationship among adjacent BIM entity models and the surrounding environmental elements. The former can ensure the correctness of the spatial relationship of each sub-level component of the model through the geometric coordinate transformation between the Revit family coordinate system and the global coordinate system. The latter realises the correct positioning of the"
