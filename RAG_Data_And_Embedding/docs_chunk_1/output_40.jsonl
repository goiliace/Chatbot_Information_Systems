"arranged and defined, to make it possible for different activities to change hands between different post roles [6].2. Literature ReviewIn view of this research problem, Zhang and others believe that financial shared services are customer-oriented, and the internal departments of the company specify corresponding solutions according to the specific needs of customers to provide such specialized services [7]. Aurachman and others believe that shared service is to complete repeated and routine work in the enterprise by specifying the internal organization of an enterprise and adopt certain standards and processes to turn it into self-service of the enterprise and to improve efficiency, create value, save cost, and achieve business success [8]. Zhang and others divide the service content of financial sharing into four categories: the first category, such as cash entry, sales order, and other inflow management; the second category, such as outflow management of material procurement and receipt notice; the third category, such as internal control, budget management, and other comprehensive control; and the fourth category is to provide knowledge intensive remote consulting services. The core business personnel can focus more on finance [9].

"on finance [9]. Xu and others summarized seven characteristics of financial sharing according to the practice of enterprises on financial sharing services: standardization, process, institutionalization, high quality, high efficiency, low cost, and value creation [10]. Zhu and others pointed out that the shared service center can be a targeted shared service organization or enterprise provided outside the enterprise. It is an innovation of the operation and management mode with the customer's requirements as its own development direction. It can provide shared services for enterprises in different functional departments and industries through price and service level [11]. Kostikova and others pointed out through research that after ZTE establishes sharing center, enterprises and financial personnel can have a good space for learning and development and will get good results and development prospects [12]. Wang and others analyzed the stage characteristics and existing problems of bank information construction focusing on comprehensive business system and discussed the functional framework and planning mode of bank information system construction with management accounting as the core [13].

"perspective of credit management informatization and believed that the development of bank informatization can be divided into \"three stages,\" traditional business and computer application stage, computer network and business innovation stage, and data application stage [14]. Yu and Sun believe that state-owned banks have entered the \"flat\" development stage [15]. He and others believe that the information construction of large and medium-sized banks has completed the initial installation, popularization, and control stage of Nolan model. At present, it is in the late stage of integration or the middle stage of data management, while most small and medium-sized banks are in the control stage of information system [16].3. MethodsAccording to the prediction of an international consulting company, a new generation of BPM technology will appear within ten years, and it is also believed that this technology can determine the enterprise management within 50 years in the future. At present, the research work of this technology mainly focuses on the system, model, and definition language, as well as the evaluation content of implementation technology and policy. We can directly grasp the transaction characteristics of the process and realize the operation in different fields in this system in combination with the application of various Internet technologies. When studying this work, we can solve various scheduling tasks such as theory construction, model verification, simulation,"
"and realize the operation in different fields in this system in combination with the application of various Internet technologies. When studying this work, we can solve various scheduling tasks such as theory construction, model verification, simulation, and resource coordination, to deal with the problems in the process and to form a system integration scheme. At present, there are no standard requirements in this work, so this research work can be carried out from many aspects. If the key problems are analyzed from a strategic perspective, this model can be studied in combination with ARIS framework and analyzed in combination with corresponding theories [17]. If the analysis is carried out according to agent technology, we need to start with the distribution of heterogeneous environment and process cooperation mechanism. However, if we study it in combination with BPM implementation method, we need to improve the evaluation, so that we can analyze it in combination with the process model. BPML is a description language based on language model. It can summarize data flow, event flow, and information flow in combination with the actual needs of business processes. At the same time, on this basis, it can also help business processes add corresponding rules and systems, to improve the quality and level of management. Compared with traditional methods, this kind of method has strong advantages. For example, it can directly describe the end-to-end process, or it can directly"
"processes add corresponding rules and systems, to improve the quality and level of management. Compared with traditional methods, this kind of method has strong advantages. For example, it can directly describe the end-to-end process, or it can directly analyze the process model from the perspective of participants. This kind of process form ensures the requirements of consistency check and process optimization capability. When connecting to the access port, it is necessary to check the operation status in combination with the process instance, and the subsequent process model can also be deployed [18]. With the continuous development of current products and services, more and more enterprises choose to start applying BPM system. At first, large companies use this system, followed by small and medium-sized enterprises, followed by smaller enterprises. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that this system is more attractive to market transformation and allows more heavyweight enterprises to apply this system [19]. After purchasing the system, you can select the appropriate server suite in combination with your own business direction to help open the service function. The enterprise only needs to purchase this system once, and it can be developed and integrated in the future. At present, Microsoft has built a business process alliance, and alliance members agree to add support for Microsoft business process management server to their business process management products. The"
"it can be developed and integrated in the future. At present, Microsoft has built a business process alliance, and alliance members agree to add support for Microsoft business process management server to their business process management products. The establishment of the new alliance shows that business process management has reached an inflection point in its own development process, which has attracted the attention of more and more middle-end market companies. The market is ready to adopt business process management solutions on a large scale. The alliance will focus on the development of business process modeling and analysis, business rule management, people-oriented process flow, process simulation, and service-oriented architecture life cycle management. If the enterprise architecture is integrated with the service-oriented architecture, it can provide a blueprint for the development of the enterprise architecture [20]. SOA is a coarse-grained, loosely coupled service architecture. Services communicate through simple and accurately defined interfaces, which does not involve the underlying programming interface and communication model. In the system of SOA architecture, the function of specific application is constructed by some loosely coupled components with unified interface definition, that is, service composition. Because BPM system needs to deal with the process integration between people, people and systems, systems and systems, and the combination of BPM"
"by some loosely coupled components with unified interface definition, that is, service composition. Because BPM system needs to deal with the process integration between people, people and systems, systems and systems, and the combination of BPM system and SOA can release the burden of integration but concentrate on the interaction and integration between systems. Software vendors say the big advantage is that they can extract back-end applications from the process, while BPM tools allow business people to specify how the process will be executed and what services to adopt without having to have an in-depth understanding of technology. The integration process of BPM construction, industry, and finance is shown in Figure3. The architecture of BPM system is shown in Figure4.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointBPM construction industry finance integration process.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointBPM system architecture.According to analysts' prediction, BPM will become the driver of SOA implementation, and the integration technology integrating BPM and SOA is still immature. The alliance between BPM and SOA will increase their chances of becoming leaders in the industry. Enterprises should start to try the tools and practices to achieve SOA-BPM Alliance based on existing technology, so as to occupy a leading position ten years after the maturity of this technology.

The SOA-BPM alliance architecture is shown in Figure5.Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPointSOA-BPM alliance architecture.The business process management system separates the process from various underlying applications, which can realize process design, storage, query, and deployment and form data redundancy and consistency dislocation with other systems through the process server, which is difficult to realize collaboration and sharing. This paper puts forward the design idea of business process management system based on ontology. Heterogeneous systems interoperate with ontology to realize the sharing and reuse of business processes. This paper mainly carries out the following research work:(1)On the basis of business process analysis and modeling, the description of business process conceptual model based on ontology is realized, which provides support for the construction of process knowledge base and process retrieval(2)According to the idea of case-based reasoning, an ontology-based business process knowledge base is established, and the business process is decomposed based on goal.

"based on goal. The business process model is stored in the process knowledge base in the form of file storage, so that the business process can act as a medium for semantic recognition of concepts in the field of business process management in different application systems, to avoid repeated design of the process and realize sharing and reuse(3)Taking the procurement business process as an example, an ontology-based business process management system is realized. The experimental system involves the functions of ontology-based business process description, analysis, storage, retrieval, and reasoning3.1. Solutions to Research Problems3.1.1. Business Process Management OverviewBusiness process management system provides a software environment for realizing the function of BPM. BPMS describes the business process model with a unified representation, which makes the business process extracted from the implementation logic and used by various enterprise applications. The business process management system is the same as the database management system, which manages data from all angles. It can realize process design, editing, storage, and query. Therefore, it cannot be limited by department boundaries and business types, makes full use of enterprise application systems, realizes cooperation among enterprises, manages processes independently, and makes the formulation of specific processes possible, which has great flexibility.3.1.2.

"full use of enterprise application systems, realizes cooperation among enterprises, manages processes independently, and makes the formulation of specific processes possible, which has great flexibility.3.1.2. BPM DefinitionThe business process of an enterprise is the process in which an enterprise completes its business and obtains profits. Production process, financial process, new product development process, procurement process, and supply process are all a manifestation of enterprise process. In the traditional management mode centered on functional management, enterprise process only connects multiple functional elements of the enterprise in a structured and sequential way. When dealing with the relationship between processes, set the necessary materials to strengthen the mutual independence of processes rather than the integration of processes. This process can only be regarded as a production process rather than a business process. At present, there are many definitions of process. Process is defined as an overall system composed of many business activities. It is composed of four elements: activities, logical relationship between activities, implementation mode of activities, and bearers of activities. Another creator of business process reengineering theory defines process as the sum of a series of organized and measurable activities that produce specific products or services for specific customers or markets. It focuses on how the work in the organization is"
"creator of business process reengineering theory defines process as the sum of a series of organized and measurable activities that produce specific products or services for specific customers or markets. It focuses on how the work in the organization is completed, not how the product is produced. The above are the various definitions of interpretation and management masters in the dictionary.Business process management is a process that uses resources and information to convert input into output under certain constraints to achieve a series of business activities with certain logical relationship. In the traditional principle of division of labor, the function-oriented management mode decomposes each process into segments. People pay attention to a single task or work within the department. Each doing its own thing is bound to cause various internal contradictions, which is not conducive to the realization of the organizational goal of the enterprise. In the environment of fierce market competition, the obstacles caused by this model to the development of enterprises are becoming more and more obvious. BPM is a process-oriented management mode. According to the business process and long-term development plan of the enterprise, combined with the current situation of the enterprise, it designs the improvement scheme of the business process, combs and optimizes the business process of the enterprise, finds out the missing process, and standardizes the nonstandard process."
"combined with the current situation of the enterprise, it designs the improvement scheme of the business process, combs and optimizes the business process of the enterprise, finds out the missing process, and standardizes the nonstandard process. Finally, put forward reasonable business processes and determine the strategic objectives of the enterprise, to improve the efficiency and management level of the enterprise; make great progress in key indicators such as profit level, production efficiency, product development ability and speed, and customer satisfaction; and finally improve the overall competitiveness of the enterprise [21].3.1.3. BPMS Function ModuleThe ideal business process management system should have the following functional modules:Process warehouse: provide a centralized storage place for processes and process-related knowledge, and provide directory services to facilitate process query and release.Process design: design the modules, logic, rules, and execution roles of the process, and provide process templates and reuse mechanisms.Process configuration: bind participants, allocate resources, and set other specific parameters for the operation of process instances.Process engine: drive the operation of the process, maintain the process data, manage the state of the process, and realize the transaction management of the process. For distributed processes, it is necessary to interact and coordinate with other process engines.Process maintenance: process"
"the process, maintain the process data, manage the state of the process, and realize the transaction management of the process. For distributed processes, it is necessary to interact and coordinate with other process engines.Process maintenance: process monitoring and exception handling.Capture process entry: provide a unified process access mechanism for process users, including work task list and report, and provide process access rules of enterprise alliance.Process optimization: optimize resource utilization to ensure process consistency and prevent deadlock.Process analysis: analyze the key performance indicators and process simulation, and analyze the time and resource performance of the process.3.1.4. BPMS Process Knowledge BaseBusiness process management system enables enterprises to model, deploy, and manage core processes. Firstly, business analysts are required to model business process analysis and store the basic process design patterns in the process knowledge base, which can be responsible for distributed authorization for business processes based on network users for their access. Secondly, using the process management tools that can be accessed by any browser, users can add and deploy business processes from the process knowledge base to the process management system. Processes can be deployed and updated without interrupting the process server. The tools provided to users can dynamically query the status of any process instance like the process server"
"from the process knowledge base to the process management system. Processes can be deployed and updated without interrupting the process server. The tools provided to users can dynamically query the status of any process instance like the process server itself.3.2. Experimental Method for Verifying the Scheme3.2.1. Process Perception Judgment MethodIn order to truly simulate the decision-making process of managers, based on the theory of perceived value, the link of perceived judgment should be introduced to complete the development of the whole system. The supplementary content of the system is the judgment link, which is reflected in the process model. It is the first three links, namely, attention, interest, and desire.Attention: for managers, there are usually the following channels to obtain information: business materials, sales personnel, network, etc. in various channels; some contents will always be mentioned repeatedly to impress themselves. At this time, managers need to analyze the management process in combination with some contents, which will attract attention. At this point, we set the known content toα.(1)(2)αis the degree of understanding,Nrepresents number of perceived information, andairepresents the understanding of perceived information.Interest: after managers have a certain understanding of a certain management work, they can effectively configure it, to change the traditional management scheme and system configuration in combination with the"
"the understanding of perceived information.Interest: after managers have a certain understanding of a certain management work, they can effectively configure it, to change the traditional management scheme and system configuration in combination with the corresponding needs and further understand the opportunities or ideas of the specific situation of the configuration, to analyze the benefits and damages brought by this practice. Managers' clear knowledge of the specific situation of a certain configuration is the precondition for optimizing management. In this paper, managers' understanding of a certain work is called configuration understandingβ.(3)(4)βrepresents the degree of understanding,Nrepresents the number of perceived information, andairepresents the understanding of perceived information.Desire: when and only when managers fully understand the specific content of a certain information can they comprehensively evaluate and measure whether the management work meets the needs in combination with the current and foreseeable future management situation. The higher demand degree can lay the foundation for the follow-up management work, and its predictability of the final management degree is called demand degree (γ).(5)(6)γrepresents the degree of demand,Nrepresents the number of perceived information, andairepresents the understanding of perceived information.3.3.

"the degree of demand,Nrepresents the number of perceived information, andairepresents the understanding of perceived information.3.3. Exception Handling Based on Case-Based ReasoningThe case-based reasoning method writes the historical exception handling situation into a case and saves it in the case base. When an exception occurs, search the case base, match the current exception with the cases in the base, and find the case with the greatest similarity. If the two situations are the same, handle the current exception according to the solution of the case in the library; otherwise, it will be adjusted with reference to the solution of the case in the library to generate the solution of the current exception. After the exception handling is completed, the solution will be stored in the library as a new exception case for subsequent reference.3.3.1. Exception Handling Based on ECA RulesECA rule method describes the exception handling conditions and behaviors with exception eventE(event), conditionC(condition) for determining the exception and its type, and exception correction or compensation activitya(action). ProcessPcan be defined as a triple set:(7)where(8)is a collection of process activities. Then, each element item in each activityai(1 ≤f≤m) represents the activity executor, the application called by the activity, time constraint, input, and output data in turn.(9)is the connection between activities, indicating the activity control logic. Each connectioncj(1 ≤j≤n)"
"in each activityai(1 ≤f≤m) represents the activity executor, the application called by the activity, time constraint, input, and output data in turn.(9)is the connection between activities, indicating the activity control logic. Each connectioncj(1 ≤j≤n) corresponds to a condition to judge the activation condition of the connection.(10)It is a process logic rule that describes the logical relationship between activity import/export.Rule-based ECA(11)Each ECA rule can be defined as a triple:(12)Ev is an abnormal event and a triple:(13)where type is enumerative data, indicating that the type of abnormal event corresponds to different processing methods. It is generally a composite class.3.3.2. Knowledge-Based Exception HandlingWith the development and application of knowledge management technology, knowledge utilization has attracted more and more attention in the business community. In the field of flexible business process management, experts and scholars also actively explore the role of knowledge in exception handling. At present, some scholars have proposed exception handling technologies and methods based on knowledge management theory, among which knowledge exception handling is the most representative. This method classifies the exceptions according to the general process classification structure, establishes the exception type knowledge base, and describes the basic characteristics of each exception type, prediction and detection methods, and prevention and solution"
"the exceptions according to the general process classification structure, establishes the exception type knowledge base, and describes the basic characteristics of each exception type, prediction and detection methods, and prevention and solution methods in the knowledge base. On this basis, using the association between the process model and the general process classification structure, we can find and determine the types of exceptions in the process of implementing business process management and then provide the functions of foreseeing, detecting, preventing, and solving exceptions according to the exception information in the exception type library. Based on daily processing, the basic process is shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointDaily exception handling process.3.3.3. Parameter Optimization Process of Process and Its Knowledge RequirementsThe parameter optimization of the actual process mostly belongs with multiparameter and multiobjective optimization. Generally, the optimal algorithm is adopted. By establishing the optimization model, the indexes such as process time, cost, and resource utilization are comprehensively considered. After determining the optimization objective function, decision variables, and constraints, the optimization approximation iterative algorithm is used to gradually adjust the process parameters until the requirements are met.If the process model minf(x) is to be solved, wherexis ann-dimensional"

Similarity and CorrelationIn order to compare the correlation and similarity between concepts, the concepts of correlation and similarity are proposed. Correlation is a real number between [0,1]. If there is a connected path between two concepts in a certain conceptual system, then, these two concepts are related, and their correlation can be calculated. Similarly, similarity can also be a real number with a value between [0,1]. If the semantics implied between the two concepts are"
"two concepts in a certain conceptual system, then, these two concepts are related, and their correlation can be calculated. Similarly, similarity can also be a real number with a value between [0,1]. If the semantics implied between the two concepts are the same in a certain conceptual system, the two concepts are similar. There are many methods to calculate the semantic similarity between concepts, for example, the method based on volume label, the method based on corpus statistics, the method based on synonym dictionary, and the method based on graph structure. This paper uses the calculation method of semantic similarity proposed in the literature.Lett1andt2be two concepts in the ontology, anddrepresent the similarity between the two terms; then, there is a formula:(18)wherenis the term;t1andt2are the maximum depth in the conceptual model; andθiis the weight. The weight can be adjusted according to the actual needs.4. Results and AnalysisThe workflow dashboard is mainly used to provide the monitor with the real-time operation of the process. Through the relevant process instance data and information, the system administrator and online operators at all levels can find out the problems and bottlenecks in the process operation and endow the system with stronger process operability and early warning ability.

Real Optimization Analysis of Sales System DataThe optimization of accounting informatization under JKJT financial sharing in a city realizes the real and effective data reading and query of sales subsystem data. From the serious treatment of information input by subsidiaries and sales departments and the convenient operation of Kingdee system, realize the timely and accurate input of sales system data and realize the statistics and analysis of enterprise operation data by sales personnel, financial personnel, and management performance assessors.The optimization of data accuracy and authenticity of the sales system save the review and inspection work of financial personnel, the workload of financial personnel, labor cost, and operation cost. Sales system data deals with core business in enterprise informatization. Management and decision-making can directly understand the performance and basic cost analysis of core business through system data, to make effective sales performance and sales input-output profit analysis.4.1.2.

"the financial sharing of JKJT in City A realizes the query of production execution. The instruction list is generated from different states, and other departments can see the production execution. Before the implementation of optimization, the specific implementation of production can only be mastered and controlled by the manager of the production department and the supervisor of the production workshop. The issuance of production instructions also depends on paper documents to the production workshop. However, now that sales, planning, and production are completed in one line, the financial department and other decision-making departments can query the production implementation and judge whether the materials have been received, whether they have entered the workshop for production, whether semifinished products have been warehoused, and how long the finished products will be completed. Production execution analysis is a high-value core business process in accounting informatization. The management obtains the construction effect of Financial Sharing Center through production execution analysis. The analysis of production execution in accounting informatization can enable the management to regulate the upstream and downstream business departments in real time, reasonably arrange the production plan and schedule, enhance the linkage between production business and financial system, effectively improve the management level of production departments, promote the financial"
"business departments in real time, reasonably arrange the production plan and schedule, enhance the linkage between production business and financial system, effectively improve the management level of production departments, promote the financial department to collect and process the enterprise production status information, and prepare all aspects of data for decision-making.4.1.3. Production Schedule Optimization ControlProduction progress control is a part of production planning and scheduling. The shortage of a production order can be seen briefly through the information system, and the adjustment and control of production progress can also be adjusted directly through the system. Through the optimization of accounting informatization, finance is directly linked to production data, and all related data can be found by using one system, which is the linkage of information and the efficiency of management. Before the optimization of accounting informatization in JKJT of City A, the production department was the core value chain of the enterprise, independent of financial informatization, and was fully managed by a deputy general manager. Not to mention the defects of the enterprise system, but from the perspective of enterprise financial management, there is no business department with information output and closed operation information.

How to provide enterprises with decision-making, make correct judgment, and create economic benefits. The optimization of accounting informatization has opened the information door of the production department. From the perspective of information sharing, the core value department can send important information through the accounting informatization software. Combined with the initiative of financial management, it can improve the information sharing of JKJT production department in a city and supervise and control the production progress of the enterprise.4.2. Post and Enterprise Personnel Structure Optimization Analysis4.2.1. Optimization of Post Structure of System OperatorsUnder the sharing economy, information sharing, personnel sharing, and financial sharing services, the first layer of the accounting informatization operation structure of JKJT in City A is the operators participating in informatization, the rights, responsibilities, and evaluation of posts. Effectively improve employees' understanding of accounting information system and information development, and implement effective post rights and responsibilities system, which plays a standardized management role in the management and operation of enterprises.

JKJT company of a city uses the mode of \"sharing economy theory\" to coordinate the idle and standby human resources of the enterprise to the deepening and optimization of accounting informatization and implements the regular operation post rotation system. Not only let the operators of the corresponding posts be familiar with and master the application of the system, but also let the operators of adjacent posts understand the importance of upstream and downstream connection, improve the level of enterprise accounting informatization, and optimize the positive effect of accounting informatization on the enterprise.4.2.2. Optimization of Financial Personnel StructureIn the process of gradually developing accounting informatization construction in JKJT of City A, the members of the informatization team are constantly updated. The information docking personnel of various departments are also constantly survival of the fittest, and the human resource structure under the financial sharing service is also constantly optimized, from the original 25 financial accounting personnel to a 10-person accounting team.

"team. Through the construction of Financial Shared Service Center, one accounting accountant and one cashier in each branch will be optimized and allocated, and they will be trained and selected for compound accounting, to promote the transformation from traditional accounting to compound accounting and stimulate their financial level and financial ability to the greatest extent. The financial personnel in the Financial Sharing Center of JKJT company in City A will standardize, process, and improve their work and timely process, analyze, calculate, and modify the data transmitted to the sharing center and be able to prepare financial budget according to the expense forecast provided by each business department and strengthen the budget management of the enterprise. The audit department and the decision-making department will integrate the internal data of the enterprise, prepare the financial statements, provide them to the internal and external users of the enterprise, and provide reliable advice for the decision-making direction of the enterprise management. The existing 10 financial personnel of JKJT in a city are proficient in accounting, auditing, and financial management theories and methods. They have worked in the enterprise for more than 5 years, are familiar with the whole process of enterprise operation and management and the legal norms related to enterprise operation and management, and have solid theoretical basis and practical skills.

There is no management structure with other reporting relationship in the middle, which makes the baton of the decision-making layer play to the lowest level and can also obtain the feedback of more operators. The operator can also directly listen to the decision-making intention of the decision-maker, to improve the implementation efficiency of the enterprise. The optimization of management structure in the process of accounting informatization of JKJT in City A reduces the level and path of financial information reporting, effectively strengthens the enterprise's response ability to various information, improves the processing speed of financial data, and effectively improves the enterprise's own operation efficiency and competitiveness in the market. The specific relationship is shown in Figure9.Figure 9Open in figure viewerPowerPointManagement structure and reporting relationship after informatization optimization.4.3.

Set the total cost allocation proportion and coefficient according to the actual change index of each month, so that the system can calculate the actual unit product cost, and the financial department will transfer and share this information to relevant user departments, such as R&D technology department and sales project department. At the same time, the system provides the calculation of standard product cost according to the production BOM structure. Firstly, the technology department provides the standard BOM structure of standard products. Secondly, the purchasing department needs to provide and maintain the standard purchase amount of standard purchased parts in finished products. Thirdly, the production department provides standard labor and machine hours. Finally, the financial personnel calculate the standard cost of products through the system. The management can compare the actual cost with the standard budget cost and give the quotation of standard products. Through the optimization of cost accounting method, it can change the previous way of using a single standard fixed cost to estimate the product cost,"
"can compare the actual cost with the standard budget cost and give the quotation of standard products. Through the optimization of cost accounting method, it can change the previous way of using a single standard fixed cost to estimate the product cost, which can more truly reflect the budget of new products and improve the accuracy of quotation information. Before the optimization of accounting informatization, the product cost of JKJT in a city is calculated through the electronic version of the manual accounting quotation. Every time the product formulated by the customer needs a temporary quotation, the cost accountant needs to find out the electronic data; query the product classification, product BOM structure, and the price of standard purchased parts; and calculate the average standard cost of the product after 10 to 20 minutes. Then, it will be submitted to the R&D department, plus the hardware cost of R&D technology. Finally, it will take half an hour to send the quotation deemed reasonable by the management to the customer. Now, after accounting the product cost every time, the financial personnel will transfer the reasonable and accurate actual cost amount to the relevant departments, and the system will save the price. After obtaining it every time, they only need to enter the product classification or product name, which is convenient and accurate, and there is no need for the R&D department to add the technical cost repeatedly, so as to improve the budget and"

"needed by JKJT in a city in order to manage the optimization and implementation of accounting informatization. The management can grasp and supervise the sales staff's visit to customers in real time through CRM system, improve the sales service of marketing, and achieve the policies of presales control, in-sales supervision, and after-sales service. At the same time, the salesperson can record the content of his visit at any time through the mobile app and transfer it to the Financial Sharing Center. The system can summarize and process this information uniformly, turn the business information into financial data such as working hours and commission basis, and reduce the statistical work of zero added value of the human resource department. For project-based sales business, the salesperson can timely transmit the project progress and project stage report to the financial department through BPM system, so that the financial department can read the project contract in time, understand the conditions of project progress payment and payment budget, and obtain linkage information in enterprise budget management. At the same time, the financial department can also act as the supervision department to supervise the project completion of the sales department, promote the project completion efficiency, improve the payment collection efficiency, and enhance the cash liquidity of the enterprise.4.4.

"of the sales department, promote the project completion efficiency, improve the payment collection efficiency, and enhance the cash liquidity of the enterprise.4.4. Analysis on Optimization Effect of Financial Sharing Management4.4.1. Reduce Operating CostsThe higher the level of accounting informatization, the greater the space of financial management. Under financial sharing, enterprise accounting personnel will collect zero value-added businesses from redundant departments for unified treatment and appropriately adjust the positions of redundant personnel to reduce operating costs. At present, the first major direction of JKJT's enterprise financial management in City A is remote management and centralized processing. Since the establishment of the Financial Shared Service Center in 2019, in order to realize the application of financial shared services and the centralized management of financial funds, the financial personnel of 7 branches have been transferred to the sales department, respectively. The financial department of the head office of City A remotely manages the financial affairs of the branches and implements the centralized processing of the Financial Sharing Center for the expense reimbursement, contract review, salary accounting, collection, and payment business, and accounts receivable and payable business of the seven branches.

Reduce unnecessary cash outflow items outside the business decision-making, strengthen the decision-making ability of the management, and improve the utilization effect of funds within the decision-making. The finance department of the head office uses the accounting information management method. Understand the current situation of each business line of each branch, control the internal resources of the enterprise in real time, especially pay more attention to and integrate the internal financial resources of the company more efficiently, effectively improve the utilization rate of funds, and reduce unnecessary operating costs, as shown in Figures11-15, which are the main financial indicators of City A.Figure 11Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperating income indicators of City A from 2017 to 2020.Figure 12Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperating cost indicators of City A from 2017 to 2020.Figure 13Open in figure viewerPowerPointManagement expense index of City A from 2017 to 2020.Figure 14Open in figure viewerPowerPointSales expense index of City A from 2017 to 2020.Figure 15Open in figure viewerPowerPointOperating profit index of City A from 2017 to 2020.The"

In 2019, the increase of management expenses was less and the increase of sales expenses was higher. The main reason was that after the construction of the Financial Sharing Center, the management structure was simplified, the financial personnel were transferred, the personnel of the sales department were increased, and the employee salary was 10.8851 million yuan, an increase of 4.1931 million yuan compared with last year. After expanding the business area, the company's annual performance in 2019 was good, and the provision of year-end bonus was increased compared with last year. In 2019, the operating cost of JKJT in City A was RMB 90.0309 million, a decrease of RMB 8.1781 million compared with that in 2020, a year-on-year decrease of 8.33%.

The main reason is that the financial sharing mode was established in 2019, and the financial department strengthened the control of cost management and funds of branches. At the same time, the acceptance measurement of the local project in City A was RMB 57.0251 million, because the project operates locally, the advantages of financial services are obvious, and the cost is relatively low.4.4.2. Improve the Efficiency of Obtaining InformationThe optimized accounting information management mode will reduce the time difference in enterprise operation and management, enhance the information processing ability of the business department of the enterprise, strengthen the cooperation with finance, achieve the purpose of enterprise collaborative management, and effectively reduce the inconsistency and asymmetry of the information of each business department, to quickly obtain effective business information. After optimizing the accounting informatization, JKJT of City A added the management of production core business chain and optimized the problem of asymmetric information between sales and warehouse business, so that the financial department can call the system inventory data at any time, quickly analyze and form the financial data information report of enterprise inventory assets, and realize the dynamic supervision of the financial department over each business department.

"time, quickly analyze and form the financial data information report of enterprise inventory assets, and realize the dynamic supervision of the financial department over each business department. JKJT company of a City applies long-term and development vision, adopts economies of scale, invests and utilizes more business modules, develops more business interfaces, and summarizes different economic and business processes of different business departments into Kingdee K3, an enterprise accounting information management software, for real-time tracking, processing, and sharing. In addition, it can timely find the stuck points of the enterprise process value, conveniently and quickly coordinate all business departments to find out the causes of the problems, continuously optimize and deepen the mining of the value of the business process, further coordinate the work between various departments, and improve the efficiency of obtaining information. The better application module of Nanchang JKJT in accounting informatization lies in the purchase process of productive materials. When the production planner regularly uses the system to check the warehouse inventory, the system will alert the materials lower than the safety inventory and remind the planner to purchase materials.

Subsequently, after logging into the system, the purchaser will be prompted that a planner in the production department has a purchase demand, and the purchase business department will track it. At the end of the business, the financial department agrees to be able to query the required information, such as whether the production material application is reasonable and whether the purchase price is within the price policy. The accounting information system can provide information quickly and provide work efficiency.5. ConclusionBased on the analysis of the current situation of business process management, this paper puts forward the business process management technology based on ontology. Combining ontology technology and case-based reasoning technology, a business process knowledge base is established to avoid the repeated design of business processes, realize the sharing and reuse of processes, and facilitate the interoperability between systems. Optimize and analyze City A in various fields: cost accounting, accurate optimization, project technical quotation effect analysis, financial sharing management optimization effect analysis, business system data authenticity and accuracy optimization effect analysis, and post and enterprise personnel structure optimization analysis. Through these optimized data,"
"effect analysis, financial sharing management optimization effect analysis, business system data authenticity and accuracy optimization effect analysis, and post and enterprise personnel structure optimization analysis. Through these optimized data, the business process concept is described based on ontology, which makes the concept clearly defined, realizes the consistency of semantic understanding, eliminates the obstacles to the understanding of business requirements, reduces the loss of functional requirements, and reduces the risk of process management. Based on the idea, the business process knowledge base is established to support the addition, deletion, and modification of process cases; realize the management of process knowledge base; and provide work efficiency. Under the background of the rapid development of big data and information technology, the enterprise accounting informatization under the financial sharing service should pay attention to the selection of appropriate implementation scheme. The enterprise management should attach great importance to it, strengthen the training of financial management talents, and continuously optimize the business process. With the continuous development of economy and technology under the background of the times, financial shared services will continue to join the core business processes of enterprises, which lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the deepening and fine management of enterprises.

"technology under the background of the times, financial shared services will continue to join the core business processes of enterprises, which lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the deepening and fine management of enterprises. In the future development, the business process needs to be continuously optimized, and the financial personnel need to master more information technology knowledge. The operators of each business department should maintain the ability and enthusiasm to accept fresh objects. The enterprise management should also maintain the sensitivity to policies and economy, grasp the opportunity, and promote the enterprise to take off again.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no competing interests.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the Huainan Union University.Open ResearchData AvailabilityThe labeled datasets used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.References1Zhao X.,Yongchareon S., andCho N.

"AbstractWith the rapid development of the economy, the integration of corporate strategic management and human resource management has become an issue of concern. This research mainly discusses the role of intelligent communication management terminal in the construction of human resource management mode. In this research, the system development process of this research mainly uses the class library in the software architecture layer to support the software development process. The main development language of Android, JAVA, is to install the Android Develop Tools plug-in on eclipse and install the Android SDK in the computer operating system to build the Android development environment. The development and application of the system not only make the enterprise managers more convenient and efficient in the process of managing the enterprise but also smooth the operation of the enterprise while reducing the human resource investment and also gives the employees more right to know and the right to participate in the enterprise construction. By creating more value while reducing human resource input, enterprises will enable it to obtain more benefits, and thus enter a cycle of good development and contribute to society.

The recruitment management function of the system is mainly composed of recruitment plan management, recruitment information management, and talent pool. In the system's recruitment plan management function, important information such as the recruitment part, the number of recruits, personnel requirements, and the specific arrival time of the personnel must be clarified. The personnel in charge of the enterprise personnel department shall conduct corresponding regulations according to the specific needs of the enterprise and shall be experienced by the personnel department. The review is carried out, and all parts of the enterprise are coordinated and completed at the same time. In the platform performance test, when the number of concurrent users reaches 50000, the request time is about 6 seconds, which meets the requirement that the response time of 10000 people per second is less than 10 seconds. This research puts forward suggestions and countermeasures for the optimization of human resource management, which can not only improve the efficiency of Y company's human resource management but also provide useful reference and reference for other enterprises facing the same problem.1.

IntroductionScientific human resource management concept originated in western countries, human resource management information system is evolved from the western \"electronic archives,\" and foreign human resource management information system from the 1960s, after decades of development, has been more comprehensive integrated into the advanced thought of human resource management and scientific theory. At present, there are not many studies that focus on corporate social responsibility or corporate social responsibility practices from the perspective of human resource management in the Chinese context, especially at the organizational level, which discusses corporate social responsibility practices from the perspective of employees. In addition, it is very necessary to discuss the impact of corporate social responsibility on human resource management and organizational performance in the context of China.

"management information system has gradually solved the main problems in the first stage, while some simple financial functions, compensation, and report functions are reflected, but due to the human resource management field involved unfamiliar and lack of professional knowledge restrictions [1,2].Due to the fierce competition in the talent market, human resource management has been increasingly paid attention to and has become one of the internal core management affairs of each enterprise. The demand for human resources management information system in all walks of life has become more urgent and has higher target requirements. In this period, the development of human resources management information system can be considered from the professional perspective of human resources management, unified management of information input and data storage for unified management, and some financial functions and other data calculation, and the use interface of the system is more friendly. The main problem to be solved in this article is how to solve the \"information island\" of the human resources market, realize the interaction between the human resources market online and offline, and realize the interconnection and intercommunication of the human resources market public services and labor management systems; how to use self-service terminals and mobile terminals and other equipment realize the expansion of public employment service channels; how to realize the Internet,"

At this time has entered the era of information development, with the continuous improvement of computer science and technology, especially the renewal of information technology and the wide application of Internet technology, human resources management information system is not only used for the traditional business management system, and more for the needs of other users, the management functions are more and more increasingly clear, changed the original closed mode, and extended to the departments of the enterprise [3].In order to effectively meet the challenges, human resources have been recognized as one of the most important factors in today's competitive market. Great advances in information and communication technology (ICT), changing workforce mix and personal values, the emergence of the knowledge economy, and increasing global competition have created great challenges for organizations.

"The focus of his research is to gain insight into current HRM practices and their impact on employee satisfaction in the private banking sector in Bangladesh. For the study, 100 bank employees were selected from selected banks, and of the 88 employees who answered correctly, the answer rate was 88 percent. The questionnaire includes nine different aspects of human resource management, including recruitment and selection system, salary scheme, job security, career growth, training and development, management style, job design and responsibility, reward and incentive, and working environment. His research data is too little [4]. Guest argues that the mutually beneficial model suggests that HRM should benefit both individuals and organizations. However, the dominant models in HRM theory and research continue to focus primarily on ways to improve performance, with employee concerns a secondary consideration. In addition, stress at work and in society more generally is posing a growing threat to the well-being of employees. If employee concerns and threats to welfare are to be taken seriously, a different framework of human resource management analysis is required. He proposes an alternative approach to human resource management that prioritizes practices aimed at improving well-being and positive employment relationships, arguing that both elements are essential.

"that prioritizes practices aimed at improving well-being and positive employment relationships, arguing that both elements are essential. While he provides evidence in support of practice selection, he fails to demonstrate that these practices also have the potential to improve individual and organizational performance [5]. Ones et al. believes that the explosive growth of empirical research often produces contradictory results, hiding important content that can guide the evidence-based application of human resource management. The science of human resource management can turn to meta-analysis and meta-analytical thinking as an antidote to the so-called replication crisis plaguing the social sciences in general. He focuses on issues and potential problems that may threaten the accuracy and effectiveness of contemporary human resource management meta-analyses. He believes that the meta-analysis must address these issues correctly in order to achieve its full potential in advancing the science and practice of human resource management. He addresses the problem of identifying and including all relevant effect sizes, as well as appropriate fixes for unreliability and scope limitations.

"the inclusion of unpublished practitioner studies and data in HRM meta-analyses is unknown [6]. Chowhan et al. made a theoretical contribution by exploring the relationship between HRM practices and innovation results at the workplace level through the continuous feature approach. Innovators are classified by their degree of success in implementing new product/process and/or improved product/process results year by year. The human resource management practices explored include the use of high-quality personnel, as well as subpackages of skill enhancement, incentive enhancement, and opportunity enhancement practices. In addition, he explores work organization practices, including integration and collaboration, the introduction of organizational change, and the use of technology. The findings suggest that workplaces that set strategic goals related to innovation motivate employees, create opportunities for employees to take action, and make greater use of technology tend to be more persistent innovators. Although these findings contribute to the formulation of government policies, the results of seeking to improve innovation performance are not satisfactory [7]. Crowley and Bourke believe that the ability of enterprises to maximize their innovation potential is the foundation of economic growth.

"their innovation potential is the foundation of economic growth. The successful implementation of human resource management (HRM) practices is important to corporate performance, and there is a growing understanding of the benefits to companies when applying HRM practices together. He examines whether HRM practices are more effective when implemented as complementarities than when implemented separately in Irish manufacturing and service companies. The National Workplace Survey, a data set containing information on human resource management practices at the firm level, was used. Human resource management bundles related to performance management and evaluation, knowledge sharing and participation, and decision empowerment are positively correlated with innovation in manufacturing and service firms, and flexible employment contract practice bundles have a positive impact on innovation in service firms. Although human resource management is very important to enterprise innovation, it is only a theory without practice [8]. Chen et al. argue that human resources are increasingly important to East Asia's growing economies, which are trying to continue their growth by moving economically into higher value-added product markets.

Human resource management (HRM) in Taiwan, based on Confucianism and influenced by western management research and practice, has undergone various significant paradigm shifts in recent years. With Taiwan's rapid economic growth and industrial and institutional transformation, human resource management in the region has been developing. Therefore, he reviewed the development of human resource management in Taiwan in recent decades. The research reviewed was collected from work published in Chinese journals of the Social Sciences Citation Index or Taiwan Social Sciences Citation Index from 1990 to 2016. He discussed in detail the development of human resource management in Taiwan and provided a summary plan and made some comparisons with human resource management in other selected economies in East Asia, including mainland China and Hong Kong economies with the same cultural lineage and values but lacking in research innovation [9]. Sandra et al. argue that although high performance HR practices do not directly affect the firm's social performance (CSP) strengths, they do have a positive impact on the CSP strengths of companies that are highly innovative or have high levels of slack. High-performance human resource management (HRM) practices can also directly and negatively impact CSP issues. Although he developed and tested his assumptions about how high-performance HRM affects the strengths and concerns of a company's CSP, this is secondary data from a third-party"
"management (HRM) practices can also directly and negatively impact CSP issues. Although he developed and tested his assumptions about how high-performance HRM affects the strengths and concerns of a company's CSP, this is secondary data from a third-party database [10]. With the extensive attention of talent strategy in all walks of life, the human resource management information system has been widely popularized in many foreign companies, and the application rate is very high. The products of HR management information systems are not single, from single-alone to online versions to WEB-based versions. At present, a large number of relatively well-known human resource management information system products have appeared in the foreign application market.Basic HR information, job adjustment, transfer, or other training information will also cause high workload and low work efficiency; the promotion history and application status of human resource information management system in western developed countries have not only become the reference standard for its development prospect but also the reference and guide for enterprises to promote the use of HR information management system.

The system has the functions of personnel management, recruitment management, attendance management, training management, work management, and salary management. The recruitment management function of the system is mainly composed of recruitment plan management, recruitment information management, talent database, etc.2. Research Methods2.1. Smart Mobile Device Operating SystemA mobile device operating system is an operating system that can be used on mobile devices. Its biggest feature is that the system has open interfaces, allowing third-party openers to design various software programs. There are now more users of the three operating systems, iOS, Windows Phone, and Android, and the operating systems are constantly being updated.The reasons why the Android development platform is widely recognized mainly include the following aspects: (1) in the development process of Android applications, you only need to have a certain JAVA foundation to easily realize the development of Android applications, and it is easy to get started.

"you only need to have a certain JAVA foundation to easily realize the development of Android applications, and it is easy to get started. Because Android applications are developed in JAVA language, its basic principles are similar to the mechanism of J2EE, which can quickly and effectively master the work of the android development environment. (2) On the Android development platform, the SQLite database is integrated internally. With this database, developers do not need to select additional databases for implementation during the process of Android program development, which is convenient for developers' development work. (3) The Android development platform integrates a variety of practical components, which provide convenience for developers to quickly develop development work and debug software systems.Looking at today's society, it is not difficult to find that Android has already occupied a large smartphone market and is spreading globally at an unexpected rate. At present, the number of Android application software in the market has reached millions, and people can easily download all kinds of software they need in the Android application market.

"BB (behavior beliefs) represents a significant belief in the implementation of a specific behavior. When performing a certain behavior, the employee subjective norm (subjective norm, SN) is expressed as [17]:(13)Human resource management is an important part of the internal affairs management of an enterprise. It holds the personnel information of the enterprise and plays a vital role in the survival and development of the enterprise. Enterprise human resource information can provide detailed information and data support for enterprise management and development. However, for a long time, many enterprises are still using the old human resource information management model, makes human resource management work inefficient, difficult to upgrade and maintain, and low security. According to the demand analysis, the system needs to support the PC platform web access and Android mobile client access, and the two platforms work together. Therefore, the physical environment required by the system should be composed of application servers, database servers, switches, the Internet, PC terminals, mobile communication networks, mobile terminals, routers, wireless gateways, and other equipment.

"shown in Figure1.Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem physical architecture.2.2. Detailed Design of Functional Modules of Human Resource Management System2.2.1. Design of User Management FunctionThe user management function is a key function that maintains the effective operation of the entire system and can work normally. Although it is an indirect business process that is more important to the system's personnel, if the system can operate normally and effectively within a predetermined range, the user management function design is still necessary. The user management function module has corresponding settings for the use authority of the system, and the system user can only enter the system interface to use the relevant functions after logging in to the system to obtain the use authority of the system. User management is a relatively basic management node in this system. At the same time, the system is mainly operated by enterprise staff, and the file management module is usually used: to protect the relevant work information of enterprise staff, but relevant data derived from the information of enterprise staff are the key part of the processing of this module, and this information mainly includes data information such as user login and authority ownership.2.2.2. Design of Personnel Management FunctionsThe design of personnel management functions employee files, personnel changes, etc. are the most critical part of the personnel management work process, which is"
"such as user login and authority ownership.2.2.2. Design of Personnel Management FunctionsThe design of personnel management functions employee files, personnel changes, etc. are the most critical part of the personnel management work process, which is related to the stability of enterprise operation and the security of data information. This module mainly includes contract management, file management, and personnel changes wait. Among them, contract management and file management have the most basic operations of the personnel management system, such as contract management and file management, which should have a series of basic functions such as adding and deleting. After corresponding changes, corresponding changes can be made on the basis of changes.2.2.3. Design of Recruitment Management FunctionRecruitment is an important part of talent attraction in the process of human resource management. This system mainly relies on the Internet and talent recommendation in the selection of talents. The recruitment management function of the system is mainly composed of recruitment plan management, recruitment information management, and talent pool. In the system's recruitment plan management function, important information such as the recruitment part, the number of recruits, personnel requirements, and the specific arrival time of the personnel must be clarified. The personnel in charge of the enterprise personnel department shall conduct corresponding regulations according to"
"as the recruitment part, the number of recruits, personnel requirements, and the specific arrival time of the personnel must be clarified. The personnel in charge of the enterprise personnel department shall conduct corresponding regulations according to the specific needs of the enterprise, and shall be experienced by the personnel department review is carried out, and all parts of the enterprise are coordinated and completed at the same time.The recruitment information management module is used by the personnel commissioner to operate and publish through the front end of the system. The personnel recruitment information can be forwarded by link, which is convenient for corporate staff to discover the talents around them and expand the corporate talent pool. The talent pool is mainly used to store the talent information discovered by the enterprise in the recruitment process.2.2.4. Design of Attendance Management FunctionAttendance management function module is the basis to ensure the orderly operation of the enterprise. This function module mainly includes attendance system management, dynamic management, leave management, and attendance record. Among them, the time and attendance system management is used to explain the standards of the company for the time and attendance management, including system preparation, system review, and system release.The first condition for operating dynamic management is to perform recognition and registration, that is, to recognize the"
"the standards of the company for the time and attendance management, including system preparation, system review, and system release.The first condition for operating dynamic management is to perform recognition and registration, that is, to recognize the user's face information through face recognition technology and match the image of the person entered into the system in advance by the human resources department. After the recognition and registration are completed, the user can perform the corresponding operation, such as the administrator manages the commuting hours and mobile office locations of corporate staff. In the check-in function module, it should be noted that only when the check-in is in the effective area, the user's check-in operation can take effect, and the dynamic trajectory is convenient to manage the field staff and is convenient for the analysis of the working time and location images and data of the field staff. The GPS function of the mobile phone is used. Therefore, employees must open the mobile phone geographic location during work, otherwise, the system will not be able to record the dynamic trajectory of the employee, and the employee will not be able to generate the dynamic trajectory of the work. It is difficult to prove whether it is working properly. When the employee completes the check-in at work and opens the geographic location, the system will use the GPS function of the mobile phone to record the geographic location information of the"
"It is difficult to prove whether it is working properly. When the employee completes the check-in at work and opens the geographic location, the system will use the GPS function of the mobile phone to record the geographic location information of the employee, and associate the generation time to form a dynamic trajectory, and then the employee's working time and location images and data can be viewed. The design of the leave management module effectively reduces the enterprise human resource management process and approval time, which is convenient for operation and management. In the attendance record module, the scope of attendance records viewed by the user is also different according to different permissions.2.2.5. Design of Training Management FunctionTraining management function modules mainly include training plans, training resources, training assessments, and training evaluations. Among them, training resources are the basis of the entire functional module. Users can publish and query training plans and related functions in the training plan module and then perform resource inspection, upload, download, and other operations in the training resource module, which realizes the recycling of resources and is effective solved the time and venue issues in the training process. In addition, the human resources department can also issue training assessment notices to organize personnel to assess the effectiveness of training, including online and offline methods. After the"
"solved the time and venue issues in the training process. In addition, the human resources department can also issue training assessment notices to organize personnel to assess the effectiveness of training, including online and offline methods. After the training and assessment are over, the training process, methods, and effects can be evaluated by the training participants, so that the training organization personnel can make corresponding improvements and enhance the company's training capabilities and effects.2.2.6. Design of Work Management FunctionsThe work management function module is mainly used to arrange and manage the work of enterprise staff. The function module includes work task management, online communication, and information notification. Work task management is the main module of this function, while online communication and information notification are auxiliary effect.Managers release the work tasks layer by layer. After receiving the tasks, the staff members will inquire and understand the task information in detail and submit the work task information, which will be fed back to the system and related personnel. The system classifies the information and automatically updates the task progress. Other coordinating personnel refer to it; and according to the completion of the work task, reward and punish those who are excellent or poor in their work. In the working process, users can also choose discussion groups to realize online video, voice, and"
"coordinating personnel refer to it; and according to the completion of the work task, reward and punish those who are excellent or poor in their work. In the working process, users can also choose discussion groups to realize online video, voice, and information exchange. The face recognition technology and voice recognition technology adopted by the system can realize the real-time transmission of video information and voice information.2.2.7. Design of Salary Management FunctionBy calculating how much wealth the employees of the company have contributed to the company and other factors in their own work develop a differentiated management platform to promote the work enthusiasm of the employees, and salary management is one of the important ways to stimulate the enthusiasm of the employees and improve the enthusiasm of the employees. Therefore, when designing an enterprise human resource management system, salary management must be regarded as a key component of the system. At the same time, there is also a close connection between the salary management function module and other management modules of the system. Therefore, the design and implementation of salary management are also critical to the operation of the entire human resource management system.Since salary management involves the actual benefits of employees, it has a very important impact on factors such as employees' work enthusiasm. It needs to calculate the work performance of each employee of the company"
"human resource management system.Since salary management involves the actual benefits of employees, it has a very important impact on factors such as employees' work enthusiasm. It needs to calculate the work performance of each employee of the company through a certain calculation method and give clear entries and reports. And also need to be able to meet the staff's query needs for historical wages. In this system, the salary management function module mainly includes salary grade evaluation management, welfare management, and salary management. The salary calculation method is shown in Table1.Table  1.Salary calculation method.NameInitial valueFormulaStateManageTransportation subsidy50.00No formula setEnableManageCommunication subsidy20.00No formula setNot enabledManageMedical insurance1.00-120Not enabledManagePension1.00-80EnableManageBe late1.00-[Number of late arrivals]∗5EnableManageLeave early1.00-[Early leave times]∗6EnableManageAbsenteeism1.00-[Number of days absent from work]∗30EnableManageTravel allowance1.00[Business trip days]∗10EnableManagePersonal leave1.00[Number of days on leave]∗10EnableManageThe prediction formula of TPB (perceived behavioral control, PBC) theory on behavior is extended to the following formula [18,19]:(14)Among them:(15)Score of resource allocation factors affecting the company's profitability [20]:(16)Use the extracted variance contribution rate of each factor to calculate the weighted average to obtain the resource allocation (PROF)"

"opportunities and challenges coexist, and the introduction of modern equipment and facilities has also brought severe tests to enterprises to a certain extent, which has stricter standards and higher requirements for management level, administrative functions, and standardized and optimized services.At present, there are mainly three kinds of databases, Oracle, SQL Server, and My SQL, which have strong applicability and excellent performance in the construction of the system. Among them, Oracle is a large database, SQL Server is a medium-sized database, and My SQL is a small database. My SQL is designed to be fast, efficient, and practical. It is a Web database system widely used on Linux-like servers and supports most operating system platforms. In terms of programming, My SQL also provides C++, C, Java, and other API interfaces, and even My ODBC interface, which can be used by all languages that can use ODBC interface. More importantly, the source code of My SQL is completely open and can be used for free. After comparing the databases of the human resource management system, we finally chose the My SQL database, and the mobile terminal chose the SQ Lite database built into Android [26]. The system management interface is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem management interface.3.

"is shown in Figure2.Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem management interface.3. ResultsAt present, the human resource management information system used by some companies only has the most basic applications such as data input, modification, and deletion and does not have information processing functions such as information query, information optimization, information statistics, and information analysis. From the perspective of processing work, it is a pity. Therefore, it is very meaningful to design a human resource management information system with more complete functions, standard design, and convenient operation.This system is B/S architecture software, and its main performance evaluation criteria are the number of concurrent users supported by the server and the average response time of users.

"realized how to use the idea of information, standardization, systematic, and modular way to manage the importance of enterprise human resources information, strive to strengthen and improve the enterprise human resources management information system construction, and began to develop or buy suitable for the company's development goals or characteristics of the human resources information management system. However, there are still many enterprise managers who have not had a clear understanding of the human resource information management system, and managers often think that starting only from the perspective of operation.Due to the many functions of this system, such as system login, personnel, attendance, performance, salary, and announcements, and other module information submission, etc., are mixed according to different weights, in order to produce a test effect closer to the real situation. Therefore, it is necessary to test the system performance under different conditions. The typical services finally selected are shown in Table3.Table  3.Typical business.Typical transaction nameFunction typeProportion of mixed trading timeLog inPublic employee function20%Attendance information submissionAdministrator function20%Personnel information submissionStaff function20%Company announcement information submissionAdministrator function20%Salary information submissionAdministrator function10%The system memory test is shown in Table4.

"the enterprise employee information manually into the computer one by one, then use the relatively simple operation of the office text or form processing software to edit it, and print out a list of employee information. Otherwise, a complete quality human resource management information system should not only have integrated centralized information source but should also have easy access and easy query database, and the purpose of the system design is to rely on modern computer processing technology to realize such a human resources information management system, embodies the principle of fairness in employee management, retain talent, and improve the management level of enterprise management.It can be seen from Table5that as the number of concurrent users increases, the number of failed requests increases, the throughput decreases, and the request time increases. From the test results, when the number of concurrent users reaches 50,000, the request time is about 6 seconds, which meets the requirement that the response time is less than 10 seconds in the case of 10,000 people per second. During the test, the hit rate and throughput per second of the system are shown in Figure3.Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem hit rate and throughput per second.In the actual operation of the system, the maximum number of concurrent users is set to 500, and the response time of the system server is 2 s.

"hit rate and throughput per second.In the actual operation of the system, the maximum number of concurrent users is set to 500, and the response time of the system server is 2 s. On this basis, this paper draws up a specific test plan, that is, 100 users are drawn to log in and access the system functions, and then 100 people are added every 10 seconds to test the response time of the system. Until the number of concurrent users of the system reaches 500, it stops, and see if the response time of the system exceeds 2 s. Subsequently, a number of repeated tests were carried out according to this test plan, the problems existing in the test process were summarized, and the overall evaluation of the system performance was finally made. The corresponding test of each module is shown as in Figure4.Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPointCorresponding tests of each module.After completing the system performance test, a number of performance tests need to be performed on the performance of the Android client in this article to ensure that the system's functions are successfully displayed on the Android client.

The results show that, except for Samsung mobile phones that will cause the system to stutter occasionally in terms of system memory usage, the rest of the Android mobile phone clients can guarantee the overall operation of the enterprise human resource management system. The memory monitoring test results of multiple mobile phone brands are shown in Figure6.Figure 6Open in figure viewerPowerPointMemory monitoring test results of multiple mobile phone brands.Since the system is researched and developed on the basis of Web technology, it is necessary to test whether the system can withstand various pressures from the operation of network users. This system uses a pressure test to verify system performance indicators. The system introduces the load runner test tool to check the system pressure. The system pressure is shown in Figure7.Figure 7Open in figure viewerPowerPointSystem pressure.The system performance test adopts the method of increasing pressure for testing. It is expected that the total number of enterprise human resources and related operators will be about 300 at most.

The employee satisfaction degree of Y company's human resource management model is shown in Figure10.Figure 10Open in figure viewerPowerPointEmployee satisfaction of Y company's human resource management model.4. DiscussionEnterprises need to adopt a series of management methods to promote employees' positive emotional cognition and evaluation of labor relationship satisfaction, in order to further realize the cross-level transformation of strategic human resource management to work performance. For example, companies not only need to provide employees with more satisfactory labor remuneration, growth and development opportunities, and labor conditions and security, but at the same time, companies should also pay attention to the individual labor load of employees, such as fair labor distribution, employee pressure perception, and labor time [27,28].Self-selection through company reputation or job characteristics: employees know more about their suitability for their jobs than the organization. When an employee is applied to a specific organization, he must first understand the reputation of the organization, such as the company's social reputation-environmental protection, community participation, relationship with the government, human resources"
"an employee is applied to a specific organization, he must first understand the reputation of the organization, such as the company's social reputation-environmental protection, community participation, relationship with the government, human resources reputation, and whether it is consistent with their own corporate social responsibility values. In the case of a match, the employee balances himself and then makes a decision. When human resource management conducts staffing and selection, the first consideration is whether employees agree with the values of the company, especially whether the company agrees with the values of creating and enhancing benefits for stakeholders, and second, whether employees, as stakeholders of the company, have fulfillment willingness and ability of the stakeholders to include their own social responsibilities, so in the staffing and selection, corporate social responsibility is an important factor affecting the selection and allocation [29].The human resource management information system has changed the focus of the human resource management department, can help human resource managers free from trivial administrative affairs, changed the past human resource workers engaged in a large number of complicated daily tasks, and rarely participated in the formulation of corporate strategies situation.

"of complicated daily tasks, and rarely participated in the formulation of corporate strategies situation. The human resource management information system has promoted the process of human resource reform. The human resource management department can no longer only provide simple human resource information and can provide decision-making support to the management anytime and anywhere, which can enable the human resource management department to truly enter the \"management\" role of strategic partners [30]. The human resource management information system improves the objectivity and transparency of human resource management and eliminates human factors through the implementation of standard business processes, which is very beneficial to achieve the consistency of human resource management behavior. The work performance of individual employees can effectively improve the overall performance of the organization. Therefore, if an organization wants to reduce the harmful interference to its long-term development and stable performance, it needs to pay attention to which effective human resource management measures can promote the individual performance of employees. Companies can take, for example, strengthening employees' career planning to effectively improve the work results of employees under formal role requirements and further strengthen the extra-role behaviors of employees that support the technical core of the organization [31].5.

"career planning to effectively improve the work results of employees under formal role requirements and further strengthen the extra-role behaviors of employees that support the technical core of the organization [31].5. ConclusionThis article uses mobile network communication technology to design and implement such an information system on enterprise human resource management for the Android environment. This system is an Android-oriented human resources information management system. The ultimate goal is to provide a platform that can manage human resources information and publish announcements and notifications; all kinds of users log in to the platform we provide through the mobile client program or the web. This platform has functions such as publishing and viewing notifications, setting department information, maintaining user information, recording attendance information, and maintaining and viewing salary information. In the follow-up research, the integration research framework of human resource management and labor relations should be explored more extensively and systematically under the more advanced integration concept in the field of labor relations.Conflicts of InterestNo potential competing interests in my paper.

"AbstractIn order to effectively manage the employment information of colleges and universities and improve the employment ratio of college graduates, the employment information management system of colleges and universities under the big data environment is designed. The graduate management platform in the system is used for graduates to edit personal information, understand employment-related information, and check recruitment information. The enterprise information management platform is used for enterprises to edit their own materials and publish recruitment information, so as to find graduates meeting the job requirements. The personalized recommendation platform uses the recommendation method based on users' historical information to achieve offline employment recommendation and uses the recommendation method based on real-time user behavior data to achieve online real-time employment recommendation and improve the employment ratio. The employment information tracking management platform is responsible for recording graduates' employment information and verifying the authenticity of recruitment information. The experimental results show that the system has a fast response time and low resource occupancy rate when the number of concurrent users is different. The employment rate of college graduates is effectively increased.1.

"number of concurrent users is different. The employment rate of college graduates is effectively increased.1. IntroductionAt present, employment websites based on the application of Internet technology have become an important tool for graduates to seek employment. Compared with traditional job-seeking methods, online employment has the advantages of high efficiency, convenience, and low cost but also has shortcomings such as low success rate and high information risk [1]. The main reasons are as follows: First, the job information provided by many companies is inaccurate or even false. Second, job seekers are not familiar with the system and do not know how to choose positions that meet their skills and expertise. Third, the job-hunting system is vague in the description of the information provided and cannot precisely locate [2]. Under normal circumstances, people usually focus on distance issues, transportation convenience issues, salary levels, working hours, and intensity when making employment choices. However, the existing employment recommendation or online job search systems lack intelligence and can only provide users with recommended information based on simple classification technology and cannot fully take into account the employment information that users are concerned about, resulting in inaccurate information matching, which affects the success rate of online job hunting and wastes resources [3], because most systems still use the traditional database system"
"account the employment information that users are concerned about, resulting in inaccurate information matching, which affects the success rate of online job hunting and wastes resources [3], because most systems still use the traditional database system model. However, a wealth of data shows that traditional databases have many obvious shortcomings.Overall, the defects and deficiencies of the existing graduate employment management system mainly include the following aspects. First, the service target is not comprehensive enough. Most of the existing employment management systems for college graduates are independently developed and operated by the school, and the purpose is only to develop and provide an online employment platform for school graduates according to their own needs [4]. Second, there are differences in the main functions. One type of system takes student file management as the main function, and the other type is used as an employment platform. Similar to the trading platform, its main function is to publish and obtain information. Third, the overall employability evaluation of graduates is insufficient. Fourth, the participants are different. In the traditional employment model, the head teacher communicates the information about talents and job requirements collected by the employment department to the students in the class and then arranges interested students to conduct centralized two-way recruitment interviews.

"the information about talents and job requirements collected by the employment department to the students in the class and then arranges interested students to conduct centralized two-way recruitment interviews. Head teachers and students are the main body of traditional employment management. Fifth, there are different degrees of openness [5]. The security and reliability of user privacy data protection are poor. Usually, when storing information, users will choose the form of plaintext storage, which has a greater risk of information and data security. Except for a small number of systems that open websites through search engines, most college graduate employment websites are not open to the outside world, only limited to the graduates of the school to query recruitment information and submit resume information to interested companies or positions. It is precisely because of such problems and deficiencies in the employment information system of traditional college graduates that the central government of our country has made clear regulations for graduates of vocational colleges to find jobs, requiring the use of graduate colleges as an employment information channel.This method can effectively transmit information between industries and regions and build a complete recruitment system for employers [6]. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job of feedback, improve the current education system, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of educators, and promote the healthy"
"between industries and regions and build a complete recruitment system for employers [6]. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job of feedback, improve the current education system, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of educators, and promote the healthy development of higher education.The low degree of informatization is the main factor affecting the scientific development of the graduate employment management system, which directly leads to the limited information exchange between graduates and recruiting units. The old system is no longer suitable for the employment information management of college graduates in the new era. In order to adapt to the development of the times and broaden the employment channels for students, the purpose of research and development of this system can be summarized as the following aspects. First of all, based on the trend of modern informatization development, we design and develop a powerful and systematic employment management information system, so as to make positive contributions to the informatization development of employment management in colleges and universities. Secondly, it is to establish a relatively complete employment management system for college graduates to improve the work efficiency of employment-related work. Finally, on the basis of the full application of the graduate employment management information system, the efficiency, timeliness, and scientificity of employment information management in colleges and"
"the work efficiency of employment-related work. Finally, on the basis of the full application of the graduate employment management information system, the efficiency, timeliness, and scientificity of employment information management in colleges and universities can be effectively improved, and the management level of managers can be improved at the same time [7,8]. If the accuracy of the result is equal to or greater than the preset threshold, it means that the decision tree model has passed the test and can be used as a tool to complete the analysis of actual data.Data clustering algorithms are often used in data mining to divide intractable information and seek regular and helpful information for solving problems. Data clustering algorithms are mainly derived from the basic theory of information theory and use information gain to measure the type of data in the decision to determine the node. The ultimate goal of system design is based on modern data mining technology and knowledge discovery technology, to design and develop an efficient, stable, system-perfect, technologically advanced, safe, and reliable college employment management information system. After the completion of the system, the college can make a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the employment situation of graduates in a timely, accurate, and comprehensive manner; build a platform for the \"two-way selection\" of employers and graduates; and place the finishing touch to the college, graduates, and"
"and comprehensive analysis of the employment situation of graduates in a timely, accurate, and comprehensive manner; build a platform for the \"two-way selection\" of employers and graduates; and place the finishing touch to the college, graduates, and employers.In recent years, in order to improve the quality of employment services, expand students' employment ideas, and broaden students' employment channels, colleges and universities have invested a lot of energy. However, due to various reasons such as establishment and funding, employment work is still difficult. The breakthrough to solve this problem is to use data mining and network. It can provide sufficient scientific basis for the high school to formulate various work plans such as employment, teaching, and scientific research [9]. The system can not only quickly and effectively collect graduates' employment intentions, employment information, occupational price views, etc., but also collect and analyze the employment needs of employers. Through the effective analysis of the data in the background database of the system, it can provide auxiliary guidance for the decision-making of the school employment management department and promote the development of future work in a purposeful and targeted manner [10]. It is of great significance to improve the total employment rate and formal employment rate of college graduates.2.

"in a purposeful and targeted manner [10]. It is of great significance to improve the total employment rate and formal employment rate of college graduates.2. The Analysis of Functional RequirementsGenerally speaking, the design of the system should meet the needs of the external environment of the system. Judging from the current external users of the system (schools, employers, and graduates) and the purpose of system development, the system is mainly for the convenience of graduates to receive information, employers to release information, and schools as a third party to facilitate management and at the same time for the use of the three parties to provide good technical support [11]. At the same time, taking into account the possible needs of future development and upgrading, as well as the convenience of system operation and maintenance management and the completeness of functions, the system should have scalability, based on the creation of typical users to describe user needs for different goals. And according to the approximate relationship between goals and needs, similar users are classified into the same user group, and then based on the common characteristics of the user group, their needs are analyzed to determine the goal of system development [12]. As mentioned above, the current external users of the system are employers, graduates, and schools. For employers, they have a better understanding of the talents they need.

"the goal of system development [12]. As mentioned above, the current external users of the system are employers, graduates, and schools. For employers, they have a better understanding of the talents they need. For schools, it has a certain guiding role in the training direction of students.2.1. EmployerAs one of the key links of employment relationship, employers must show their own information and resources to schools and graduates as much as possible when recruiting talents, which could achieve the effect of attracting talents. The needs of employers are relative to graduates. Basic management functions such as user registration, login, information query, information release, and information reception can be completed in the system [13]. The graduate employment information management system is based on the purpose of \"serving graduates and facilitating employers.\" And it is an information platform that integrates graduate employment management, business processing, graduate job search and job selection, and employer recruitment of talents. After the employer registers and opens an account in the employment information management system, it can publish recruitment, search for students, view the resumes submitted by students, and send interview notices to students. And it can send contract invitations to prospective graduates to sign contracts and labor contracts online with students and go through the procedures for receiving graduates. After logging in, the employer can"
"and send interview notices to students. And it can send contract invitations to prospective graduates to sign contracts and labor contracts online with students and go through the procedures for receiving graduates. After logging in, the employer can also modify part of the registration information and modify the login password and other operations. Firstly, recruitment information is released. After the employer logs in to the special area, they fill in the recruitment demand information in the \"Publish Recruitment Information\" column. Graduates can search for the recruitment information released by the unit after logging in. Secondly, resumes are received. After the employer publishes the recruitment requirements, graduates can retrieve the recruitment information of the unit and then send their resumes to the employer. Employers can check the resume information sent by all graduates in the \"Receipt Received\" column. For interested graduates, you can put it in your favorites for future use [14]. Third, the employment certificate is sent. If the company does not sign an online agreement with the graduates, but has an employment relationship with the graduates, it can \"send employment certificates\" to the graduates in the \"Signing Invitation\" column. After the graduates make an appointment, the employment certificate is automatically generated online and can be printed.2.2.

"\"Signing Invitation\" column. After the graduates make an appointment, the employment certificate is automatically generated online and can be printed.2.2. GraduateAs an important subject in the employment management system, graduates occupy a very core position. The main function of the employment management system is to provide a platform for graduates and employers. Both parties can publish and match relevant information in the new information system to clarify the supply and demand intentions of both parties, so as to provide graduates with sufficient employment options, through an adequate two-way choice to achieve their employment goals [15]. Similarly, the system use rights of graduates are divided into functions such as user registration and login, modification and viewing of their employment information, posting job search information, related job search, and inquiring about employer information. After the graduates and the employer have reached a contractual intention, the employer will issue a contractual invitation to the graduates. After the graduates browse the received contract invitation and additional terms and conditions, if they agree, they will accept the contract; otherwise, they will refuse to accept the contract. After the two parties sign the contract, an employment agreement will be automatically formed, and the information will be transferred to the school for review and archiving [16].2.3.
